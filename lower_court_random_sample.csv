9575504,1236251,634045,People v. Morin,People v. Morin,"
*584J. P. Swallow, J.
On January 13, 1984, defendant pled guilty to larceny in a store, MCL 750.360; MSA 28.592, and attempted larceny in a store, MCL 750.360; MSA 28.592 and MCL 750.92; MSA 28.287. On February 6, 1984, defendant was placed on five years probation. As a condition of his probation, defendant was ordered to the Rubicon/Odyssey House, a state-licensed residential drug rehabilitation program. He entered the Rubicon/Odyssey House in Detroit on March 1, 1984, and was subsequently transferred to the Rubicon/ Odyssey House in Flint, where he left without proper authorization on August 6, 1984. Subsequently, defendant was ordered to maintain his residence at Bay Fresh Start, a halfway house, and comply with all the rules, regulations and requirements of that program. On February 12, 1985, a violation of probation petition was initiated alleging violation of the rules of the Bay Fresh Start program for failing to return to the facility on February 12, 1985. On February 28, 1985, defendant was found in violation of the probation order and was resentenced on June 4, 1985, at which time his probation was reinstated and he was released from Bay County Jail.
On July 30, 1985, a petition and bench warrant for violation of probation was signed by the circuit court. The petition alleged that defendant had been involved in criminal activity, to wit: indecent exposure and larceny from a store. On September 6, 1985, defendant was sentenced for both convictions for which probation was imposed, from thirty-two to forty-eight months for larceny in a building, and from sixteen to twenty-four months for attempted larceny in a building. The sentencing judge ordered that the 277 days defendant spent in jail be credited towards his sentence, but refused to give credit for additional time defendant *585spent in Rubicon/Odyssey House and Bay Fresh Start.
Defendant raises two issues on appeal. One, defendant claims that the sentences imposed should shock the conscience of this Court. See People v Coles, 417 Mich 523, 550; 339 NW2d 440 (1983). Second, defendant contends that he had a statutory right to credit for time served at Rubicon/Odyssey House and Bay Fresh Start.
The sentences imposed do not shock the conscience of this Court. As reasons for the sentences imposed, the trial court took note of the unsuccessful attempts to reform defendant through probation, the need to protect society, and the need to deter others from like conduct. Given defendant’s record of convictions for larceny offenses, defendant’s long-standing substance abuse problem, and defendant’s failure to complete the Rubicon program, we concur in the trial court’s judgment that defendant was in need of rehabilitation. Defendant’s prior record and inability to reform through means other than incarceration justified substantial incarceration. The sentences imposed by the trial court do not evidence an abuse of discretion which shocks the conscience of this Court.
This Court finds much more troublesome defendant’s contention that he is entitled to credit for time spent at the Rubicon House and Bay Fresh Start program. At the heart of the present controversy lie this state’s probation statutes, most particularly MCL 771.3; MSA 28.1133, which provides in relevant part:
(2) As a condition of probation, the court may require the probationer to do 1 or more of the following:
(a) Be imprisoned in the county jail for not more than 12 months, at the time or intervals, which *586may be consecutive or nonconsecutive, within the probation as the court may determine. However, the period of confinement shall not exceed the maximum period of imprisonment provided for the offense charged if the maximum period is less than 12 months.
Q)) Pay immediately or within the period of his or her probation, a fine imposed at the time of being placed on probation.
(c) Pay costs pursuant to subsection (4).
(d) Pay restitution to the victim or the victim’s estate.
(e) Engage in community service.
(4) The court may impose other lawful conditions of probation as the circumstances of the case may require or warrant, or as in its judgment may be proper. If the court requires the probationer to pay costs, the costs shall be limited to expenses specifically incurred in prosecuting the defendant or providing legal assistance to the defendant and probationary oversight of the probationer.
Defendant contends that he is entitled to credit for any court-ordered confinement, whether that confinement is in the county jail pursuant to subsection (2)(a) or as an ""other condition” of probation pursuant to subsection (4). Defendant relies on the sentencing credit statute, MCL 769.11b; MSA 28.1083(2), and People v Stange, 91 Mich App 596; 283 NW2d 806 (1979), in which this Court held that time spent at Rubicon House prior to sentencing must be credited pursuant to the sentencing credit statute. Alternatively, defendant cites People v Winchell, 143 Mich App 164; 371 NW2d 514 (1985), lv den 424 Mich 878 (1986), in which this Court held that time spent in Bay Fresh Start as a condition of probation was required to be credited against defendant’s ultimate sentence.
*587The people counter that the jail credit statute has no application to the instant case, and that defendant’s proffered construction would work against the rehabilitative purpose of the probation statutes by limiting a trial judge’s alternatives with regard to rehabilitative programs and removing incentives for probationers to successfully complete probation programs.
Initially, we agree with the people that the sentence credit statute has no application to the instant case. The statute, MCL 769.11b; MSA 28.1083(2), provides: ""Whenever any person is hereafter convicted of any crime within this state and has served any time in jail prior to sentencing . . . the trial court in imposing sentence shall specifically grant credit against the sentence for such time served in jail prior to sentencing.” Defendant’s court-required residency in Rubicon House and Bay Fresh Start was subsequent to sentencing in the instant case. For that reason, People v Stange, supra, cited by defendant, is distinguishable. In Stange, the trial court specifically delayed sentencing pursuant to MCL 771.1(2); MSA 28.1131(2) and ordered the defendant to Rubicon House in the interim.
In People v Winchell, supra, this Court held that time spent at Bay Fresh Start as a condition of probation must be credited against a defendant’s ultimate sentence under the sentence credit statute as time served ""in jail” under that statute. See also People v Greene, 145 Mich App 580; 378 NW2d 553 (1985), lv den 424 Mich 873 (1986). As outlined above, we believe the sentence credit statute has no application to the facts here or in Winchell. To the extent it might be argued that court-required residency as a condition of probation prior to a sentence imposed following a probation violation is time served prior to sentencing, *588we must conclude that the Legislature did not intend credit for such time served.
MCL 771.4; MSA 28.1134 provides:
It is the intent of the legislature that the granting of probation to one convicted shall be a matter of grace conferring no vested right to its continuance, if, during the period of probation it shall appear to the satisfaction of the sentencing court that the probationer is likely again to engage in an offensive or criminal course of conduct, or that the public good requires revocation or termination of probation previously granted. ... In case such probation order is terminated or revoked the court may proceed to sentence such probationer in the same manner and to the same penalty as it might have done if such probation order had never been made. [Emphasis added.]
Clearly the statute evinces a legislative intent to permit, upon revocation of probation, the imposition of full punishment absent consideration of any previously imposed condition of probation. That MCL 771.4; MSA 28.1134 should control over the sentence credit statute cannot be disputed. When two statutes encompass the same subject matter, one being general and the other specific, the latter will control. People v Shaw, 27 Mich App 325, 326; 183 NW2d 390 (1970), lv den 385 Mich 760 (1971).
The Legislature’s pronouncement that sentencing subsequent to probation violation may proceed ""in the same manner and to the same penalty as it might have been if such probation order had never been made” is not without stricture, however. In People v Sturdivant, 412 Mich 92; 312 NW2d 622 (1981), the Michigan Supreme Court, relying on the double jeopardy clause as construed in North Carolina v Pearce, 395 US 711; 89 S Ct 2072; 23 L Ed 2d 656 (1969), held that time spent *589in the county jail as a condition of probation, MCL 771.3(2)(a); MSA 28.1133(2)(a), must be credited against a defendant’s sentence upon sentencing following probation violation.
In North Carolina v Pearce, the United States Supreme Court held that multiple prison sentences for the same crime placed a defendant in double jeopardy by twice punishing him for a single crime, and that defendants must be credited for any jail time exacted for the same offense.
The larceny statute under which defendant was prosecuted provides a maximum sentence of ""imprisonment” upon conviction. Neither the Pearce Court nor the Sturdivant Court addressed whether required residency at a rehabilitative center constituted a jail or prison term which requires credit under the double jeopardy clause.
We conclude that where our Legislature has evinced an intention that restrictive conditions of probation need not be considered upon subsequent sentencing of a probation violator, required residency at rehabilitative centers need not be credited against a subsequent sentence of imprisonment under the double jeopardy clause. In short, no double punishment has been imposed under the statutes. Rehabilitative centers are not jails. Their purpose is structured rehabilitation and treatment, not incarceration.
In the instant case, defendant’s ordered residency at the state-licensed Rubicon/Odyssey House was clearly rehabilitative. By defendant’s own admission, he was a longtime substance abuser and was also professionally diagnosed as alcoholic and cannabis dependent with a recommendation of placement in a residential treatment facility. The fact that the intensive nature of the program offered at Rubicon/Odyssey House requires residency does not entitle defendant to credit. Such a *590construction would effectively turn the obvious rehabilitative purpose of the probation statutes on its head. A defendant in need of intensive rehabilitation in a residential program would have little incentive to complete the program and, therefore, trial judges would have little incentive to utilize such programs as an alternative to prison. Defendant is entitled to no credit for time spent at Rubicon/Odyssey House.
The present record, however, is not sufficient for us to assess whether defendant’s confinement to Bay Fresh Start was for structured rehabilitation and treatment, or mere incarceration. Accordingly, on this issue, this Court remands this matter to the circuit court for development of a record if the trial court is inclined to deny credit for time spent at Bay Fresh Start, detailing the purpose of the Bay Fresh Start program, especially as applied to defendant, the restrictions which were placed on defendant there, and the trial court’s intended purpose in ordering defendant’s residence there. In determining whether defendant is entitled to credit for time spent at Bay Fresh Start, the trial court shall weigh the above factors and determine whether Bay Fresh Start offered defendant structured rehabilitation and treatment or a mere substitute for incarceration.
Defendant’s sentence without credit for time spent in Rubicon/Odyssey House is affirmed, but we remand for resentencing. Upon resentencing, the trial court, in accordance with this opinion, may either grant or deny credit for time spent at Bay Fresh Start. We retain no further jurisdiction.

7751173,7810166,64815479,Brown v. Brown,Stephanie Cummings BROWN v. Matt BROWN,"
THOMAS, J., for the Court.
¶ 1. Matt Brown was granted a divorce from Stephanie Cummings Brown on the grounds of habitual cruel and inhuman treatment. Stephanie was awarded $300 per month rehabilitative alimony for thirty-six months. Stephanie appeals the chancellor’s decision asserting the following issues as error:
I. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN GRANTING A DIVORCE TO MATT ON THE GROUNDS OF HABITUAL CRUEL AND INHUMAN TREATMENT.
II. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN DENYING STEPHANIE’S REQUEST FOR SEPARATE MAINTENANCE. ... - .
Matt cross-appeals on the following issue:
III. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN ORDERING MATT TO PAY REHABILITATIVE ALIMONY IN THE AMOUNT OF $300.00 A *590MONTH FOR THIRTY-SIX MONTHS.
Finding error, we reverse and render on the grant of divorce and remand for separate maintenance proceedings.
FACTS
¶ 2. Matt and Stephanie were married on November 20, 1993, and lived together until they separated May 26, 2000. At the time of their separation, Matt was employed as a teacher, coach, and athletic director and Stephanie was employed as a computer programmer. They had no children. Both Matt and Stephanie had bachelor’s degrees earned before their marriage. Matt received a master’s degree in education administration in 1998. Their incomes were very similar at the time of trial.
¶ 3. Matt sought a divorce on the ground of habitual cruel and inhuman treatment based upon physical and mental abuse that he alleged to have occurred during their marriage. Matt testified that there were no less than four physical attacks by his wife. One of these occurred at his place of employment. Stephanie admitted to only one such conflict which occurred a few months before their separation in which she slapped Matt. Matt admitted to shoving Stephanie into the washer and dryer on the same occasion.
¶ 4. It was at approximately the time of this conflict that Stephanie found out about Matt’s relationship with another woman. Matt refused to answer under Fifth Amendment constitutional grounds as to whether a sexual relationship with the woman was the reason for the separation and divorce. Matt also alleged that Stephanie hated his profession and constantly berated him for it which ruined the marriage for him.
¶ 5. Stephanie did not desire a divorce and she requested separate maintenance and Matt’s return to the marital home. After conducting a full trial on the matter, the chancellor granted Matt a divorce on the ground of habitual cruel and inhuman treatment. In his ruling, the chancellor adopted the parties stipulation as to the disposition of assets and debts accumulated during the marriage and awarded Stephanie rehabilitative alimony in the amount of $300 per month for thirty-six months.
ANALYSIS
I. DID THE TRIAL COURT ERR IN GRANTING A DIVORCE TO MATT ON THE GROUNDS OF HABITUAL CRUEL AND INHUMAN TREATMENT?
¶ 6. The standard of review employed by this Court in domestic relations cases is abundantly clear. Chancellors are vested with broad discretion, and this Court will not disturb the chancellor’s findings unless the court was manifestly wrong, the court abused its discretion, or the court applied an erroneous legal standard. Andrews v. Williams, 723 So.2d 1175, 1177(¶ 7) (Miss.Ct.App.1998). (citing Sandlin v. Sandlin, 699 So.2d 1198, 1203 (Miss.1997); Johnson v. Johnson, 650 So.2d 1281, 1285 (Miss.1994); Crow v. Crow, 622 So.2d 1226, 1228 (Miss.1993); Gregg v. Montgomery, 587 So.2d 928, 931 (Miss.1991)). However, we will not hesitate to reverse should we find that a chancery court was manifestly wrong, abused its discretion, or applied an erroneous legal standard. Glass v. Glass, 726 So.2d 1281, 1284(¶ 11) (Miss.Ct.App.1998) (citing Bowers Window & Door Co., Inc. v. Dearman, 549 So.2d 1309 (Miss.1989)).
¶ 7. Stephanie asserts that there was insufficient evidence to support the chancellor’s awarding of a divorce to Matt on the ground of habitual cruel and inhu*591man treatment. The ground of habitual cruel and inhuman treatment must be established by a preponderance of the evidence. Daigle v. Daigle, 626 So.2d 140 (Miss.1993). In Daigle, the Mississippi Supreme Court stated as follows:
In order to establish habitual, cruel and inhuman treatment, the evidence should prove conduct that either endangers life, limb, or health, or creates a reasonable apprehension of such danger, rendering the relationship unsafe for the party seeking relief, or in the alternative, be so unnatural and infamous as to make the marriage revolting to the offending spouse and render it impossible for that spouse to discharge the duties of the marriage, thus destroying the basis for its continuance.
Daigle, 626 So.2d at 144. (quoting S. Hand, Mississippi Divorce, Alimony and Child Custody §§ 4-12 (2d ed. Supp.1991)). Findings of fact are to be made by the chancellor. Tice v. Shamrock GMS Corp., 735 So.2d 443, 444 (¶ 3) (Miss.1999). As to those findings of fact, an appellate court is obligated to afford the chancellor substantial deference and we may not set aside the chancellor’s decision unless we are satisfied that her findings were against the substantial weight of the credible evidence. Steen v. Steen, 641 So.2d 1167, 1169 (Miss.1994).
¶ 8. Many examples can be found of conduct which does not meet the requirements of habitual cruel and inhuman treatment. In Gallaspy v. Gallaspy, 459 So.2d 283 (Miss.1984), the court determined that the test for habitual cruel and inhuman treatment had not been met where a husband constantly criticized his wife, withheld praise and support from his children, and placed a higher priority on his parents’ estates than his marriage. Gallaspy, 459 So.2d at 285. In Kergosien v. Kergosien, 471 So.2d 1206 (Miss.1985), a wife’s financial irresponsibility and abandonment of family duties, even when considered in light of occasional “acts of cruelty” directed at the children, did not justify the granting of a divorce upon the grounds of habitual cruel and inhuman treatment. Kergosien, 471 So.2d at 1208, 1210. Similarly, continued embarrassing financial practices peppered with perceived verbal and psychological abuse failed to suffice in Wilson v. Wilson, 547 So.2d 803, 804 (Miss.1989). And subsequently, in Daigle, the supreme court affirmed the denial of a husband’s petition for divorce based on his wife’s lack of intimacy, “constant hassling,” and isolated outbursts of rage. Daigle, 626 So.2d at 144.
¶ 9. Examining the case at hand, this Court must determine whether the lower court’s limited finding is sufficient for a divorce on the grounds of habitual cruel and inhuman treatment. The chancellor found that “clearly, [Matt] was not harmed by the physical contact or mental stress resulting from the arguments with Defendant and the Court cannot find such conduct endangered his life.” Since the lower court did not find in favor of Matt’s assertions of physical misconduct, it granted Matt a divorce based on the following:
[T]he Court finds the conduct of [Stephanie] in questioning the commitment of [Matt] to his profession, and the resulting arguments, and physical conduct, continued over a course of the marriage, to come within the definition of being so revolting and infamous so as to have the effect of destroying the marriage for the Plaintiff.
This finding is not supported by the evidence. Both Matt and Stephanie testified that the “resulting arguments and physical conduct” occurred over the few months prior to their separation, after Stephanie discovered Matt’s involvement with anoth*592er woman. This was not over the “course of the marriage” as the chancellor found.
¶ 10. We are left, therefore, with only the finding that Stephanie questioned Matt’s commitment to his profession. At best, this amounts to a finding of “mere unkindness or rudeness,” which is not enough for divorce under the ground of habitual cruel and inhuman treatment. Churchill v. Churchill, 467 So.2d 948, 951 (Miss.1985). There is no evidence that any physical confrontations occurred due to Stephanie’s criticism of Matt’s work. In Hassett v. Hassett, 690 So.2d 1140, 1146 (Miss.1997), the court held that “bullying, intimidation, and constant criticism [of a wife’s performance of household duties] does not fulfill the requirements of a divorce on the grounds of habitual cruel and inhuman treatment.” (citing Steen v. Steen, 641 So.2d 1167, 1170 (Miss.1994); Gallaspy, 459 So.2d at 285).
¶ 11. Therefore, the evidence in the record is not enough for a finding of habitual cruel and inhuman treatment. For these reasons, we hold that the chancellor’s decision to grant a divorce on the ground of habitual cruel and inhuman treatment must be reversed.
II. DID THE TRIAL COURT ERR IN DENYING STEPHANIE’S REQUEST FOR SEPARATE MAINTENANCE?
III. DID THE TRIAL COURT ERR IN ORDERING MATT TO PAY REHABILITATIVE ALIMONY IN THE AMOUNT OF $300.00 A MONTH FOR THIRTY-SIX MONTHS?
¶ 12. We will address these two issues concurrently. As stated in Owens v. Owens, 234 Miss. 261, 268, 106 So.2d 59, 62 (1958), “There is little difference between a suit for separate maintenance and a suit for alimony and substantially the same principles of law apply in fixing an amount.” “The power to grant separate maintenance to a wife [is] based on (a) separation without fault on the wife’s part, and (b) willful abandonment of her by the husband with refusal to support her.” Thompson v. Thompson, 527 So.2d 617, 621 (Miss.1988) (quoting Etheridge v. Webb, 210 Miss. 729, 743, 50 So.2d 603, 607 (1951)).
¶ 13. The chancellor here awarded Stephanie rehabilitative alimony in the amount of $300 a month for thirty-six months because of her efforts during the marriage which allowed Matt to receive his master’s degree with a lifelong benefit. Alimony originates from an obligation of one spouse to provide support for the other spouse. East v. East, 493 So.2d 927, 931 (Miss.1986). Separate maintenance is a judicial command to one’s spouse to resume cohabitation or to provide support. Williams v. Williams, 528 So.2d 296, 298 (Miss.1988).
¶ 14. The order granting alimony of course must be vacated in view of the lack of grounds for a divorce. Separate maintenance, however, should be considered for Stephanie. There was no evidence that the separation was completely her fault, and she is willing is to resume the marriage instead of separate maintenance if possible. A grant of separate maintenance should be considered by the chancellor. We remand for further proceedings on this issue. On remand, the lower court should apply the factors found in Gray v. Gray, 484 So.2d 1032, 1033 (Miss.1986), to determine what, if any, amount of separate maintenance Matt should pay Stephanie.
¶ 15. THE JUDGMENT OF THE CHANCERY COURT OF FORREST COUNTY IS REVERSED AND REMANDED FOR PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION. *593COSTS OF THIS APPEAL ARE ASSESSED TO THE APPELLEE.

v.
Richard P. HERGET, Jr. and Rebsamen Insurance, Inc., Appellees.
No. 94-766.
Supreme Court of Arkansas.
June 19, 1995.
*196 John E. Tull, III, Phillip S. Anderson, Jeanne L. Seewald, Little Rock, for appellant.
Allan Gates, Marsha Foster, J. Lee Covington, Little Rock, for appellee.
CORBIN, Justice.
Appellant, Marsh & McLennan of Arkansas, Inc., appeals an order of the Pulaski County Chancery Court awarding an attorney's fee to appellee, Richard P. Herget, Jr., pursuant to Ark.Code Ann. § 16-22-308 (Repl.1994) for his expense incurred in defending an action for breach of contract brought against him by appellant. Because resolution of this appeal requires interpretation or construction of section 16-22-308 and certain rules of this court, our jurisdiction is proper pursuant to Ark.Sup.Ct.R. 1-2(a)(3). Appellant raises three arguments for reversal. We find no merit and affirm the trial court's judgment.
The facts of this case are not disputed. On December 16, 1985, Herget and his employer at that time, Atkins Insurance Corporation, entered into an employment agreement that included a non-compete covenant. Our review of that agreement, as abstracted, reveals its terms did not address payment of an attorney's fee or costs in the event of litigation *197 to enforce it. Appellant acquired Atkins by stock purchase and became assignee of its rights and obligations under the 1985 employment agreement. On January 27, 1992, Herget voluntarily terminated his employment with appellant and immediately went to work for Rebsamen Insurance, Inc.
By complaint filed on May 27, 1992, as amended on July 29, 1992 and on August 31, 1992, appellant sued Herget for violation of the 1985 employment agreement and sued Rebsamen for intentional interference with contract. Appellant also alleged the actions of Herget and Rebsamen violated the Arkansas Trade Secrets Act. Appellant prayed for damages, equitable relief, and an award of its attorney's fee and costs. Herget counterclaimed, alleged the 1985 employment agreement constituted an unreasonable restraint on trade and was void and unenforceable, and prayed for dismissal of appellant's complaint and an award of his attorney's fee pursuant to section 16-22-308[1]. On September 27, 1993, the trial court entered its opinion and order in favor of appellees and dismissed appellant's complaint. No appeal was taken from the September 27 order.
Forty-two days later, on November 8, 1993, Herget filed a motion for attorney's fee pursuant to section 16-22-308 for his expense incurred in defending appellant's dismissed claim. By order filed on March 23, 1994, the trial court granted Herget's motion and allowed him the sum of $ 106,536.00 for his attorney's fee as the prevailing party in a breach of contract action. This appeal arises therefrom.

LACK OF JURISDICTION
For reversal, appellant first argues the trial court lacked jurisdiction of the motion for attorney's fee because it was untimely as Herget failed to ask the court to consider or to reserve his right to seek an award of an attorney's fee prior to entry of the September 27 order. Alternatively, appellant argues jurisdiction was lost because the motion was filed more than thirty days after entry of the September 27 order. Appellant relies upon Temple v. Lawson, 19 Ark. 148 (1857), for his argument. We find appellant's reliance upon that decision is misplaced.
In Temple, this court reversed a decree of the chancery side of circuit court that allowed the appellee, an interpleading party, an attorney's fee for his expense incurred nearly three years earlier in filing his bill for interpleader in an action of assumpsit by attachment. The appealed decree directed that payment of the fee be made from the fund the appellee had brought into court. On appeal, this court held the trial court had no power at any time to make an allowance for an attorney's fee to an interpleading party that was payable from the special fund the interpleading party had brought into the court, and more particularly so after the decree in the case had been passed. In dictum, this court also observed that, were it proper to allow the attorney's fee in such a case, the application for the fee should be made at the hearing or before the decree ""has been passed."" Id. at 154. In consideration of its unique facts, we find Temple is inapplicable to the present case.
Thus, appellant argues without persuasive authority that the trial court had lost jurisdiction of Herget's fee motion. We reject appellant's argument which, we find, is predicated on the assumption that the fee motion was integral to the merits of the underlying breach of contract action. This assumption is incorrect. Herget's fee motion raised issues collateral to the underlying action. The trial court's decision concerning Herget's entitlement to fees under section 16-22-308 required an inquiry separate from its decision on the merits of the underlying action an inquiry which could not commence until Herget ""prevailed"" over appellant in the underlying action. See White v. New Hampshire Dep't of Employment Sec., 455 U.S. 445, 102 S. Ct. 1162, 71 L. Ed. 2d 325 (1982) (holding the ten-day limit for a Rule 59(e) motion to alter or amend judgment was not *198 applicable to the petitioner's motion, as the prevailing party, for an attorney's fee under the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act of 1976, 42 U.S.C. § 1988, where the fee motion was filed four and one-half months after entry of a final judgment for the petitioner on the underlying action); accord, Obin v. District No. 9 of the Int'l Ass'n of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, 651 F.2d 574 (8th Cir.1981) (holding a postjudgment motion for an attorney's fee under the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(k), raised a collateral and independent claim, and, therefore, no question existed that the district court retained jurisdiction to rule upon the motion notwithstanding entry of a judgment resolving the merits of the discrimination claim).
""Collateral action,"" this court has stated, is ""action that does not make any direct step toward final disposition of the merits of a case, will not be merged in the final judgment, is not an ingredient of the cause of action, and does not require consideration with the main cause of action."" Pledger v. Bosnick, 306 Ark. 45, 50, 811 S.W.2d 286, 290 (1991), cert. denied, ___ U.S. ___, 113 S. Ct. 3034, 125 L. Ed. 2d 721 (1993). A motion for an attorney's fee pursuant to section 16-22-308, we have held, is a matter ""collateral or supplemental to the trial court's judgment"" which is ""left within the trial court's jurisdiction even though an appeal has been docketed"" from the order disposing of the underlying litigation. Sunbelt Exploration Co. v. Stephens Prod. Co., 320 Ark. 298, 308, 896 S.W.2d 867, 873 (1995) (citing Alexander v. First Nat'l Bank of Ft. Smith, 278 Ark. 406, 646 S.W.2d 684 (1983)). In the present case, the absence of an appeal from the September 27 order disposing of the underlying breach of contract action did not alter the collateral nature of Herget's fee motion. We conclude the trial court did not lack jurisdiction of the fee motion. White, 455 U.S. 445, 102 S. Ct. 1162; Obin, 651 F.2d 574.
Appellant concedes that no statute or local court rule prescribes any specific time limit on a motion for an attorney's fee under section 16-22-308, but entreats this court to adopt a reasonable rule. Because this issue is unnecessary to our disposition of this case, we do not address it. In so ruling, however, we note that section 16-22-308 authorizes the award of an attorney's fee in the discretion of the trial court. Chrisco v. Sun Indus., Inc., 304 Ark. 227, 800 S.W.2d 717 (1990). We agree with the observation made by the White Court with respect to section 1988, which similarly authorizes discretionary attorney's fee awards in appropriate cases, when it stated: ""We believe that [the trial court's] discretion will support a denial of fees in cases in which a postjudgment motion unfairly surprises or prejudices the affected party."" White, 455 U.S. at 454, 102. S.Ct. at 1167.[2] On the facts of this case, we conclude the trial court committed no abuse of its discretion in ordering the fee award for Herget.

WAIVER AND ESTOPPEL
Appellant next argues Herget should either be estopped or deemed to have waived his right to the fee award because he waited until twelve days after the September 27 order became final and non-appealable to file his fee motion. We summarily dispose of these arguments which are without merit.
Appellant's estoppel argument, which is unsupported by binding authority, is that Herget delayed filing the fee motion until after the appeals period had run in order to induce appellant not to file an appeal of the underlying action. Our review of the record on appeal reveals that appellant's estoppel argument was not raised before the trial court. As this court has repeatedly stated, an argument which is raised for the first time on appeal is not properly preserved for this court's review and will not be addressed. See, e.g., Bell v. Estate of Bell, 318 Ark. 483, 885 S.W.2d 877 (1994); Jarboe v. Shelter Ins. Co., 317 Ark. 395, 877 S.W.2d 930 (1994).
*199 Appellant's waiver argument is framed as follows: ""Herget knew that there was [a] 30-day limitation period in which [appellant] had to file an appeal. By waiting 42 days to file his motion for an award of attorneys' fees, he surrendered any right he had to make such a claim."" This argument is without merit. As noted above, there is no statute or local court rule that prescribes any specific time limit on a motion for an attorney's fee under section 16-22-308. Therefore, because the essence of waiver is the voluntary relinquishment of a known right, Smith v. Walt Bennett Ford, Inc., 314 Ark. 591, 864 S.W.2d 817 (1993), it was impossible for Herget to waive his right to request a fee award under section 16-22-308 by filing his motion more than thirty days after the underlying judgment was rendered.

PAYMENT OF HERGET'S ATTORNEY'S FEES BY REBSAMEN
Appellant's final argument for reversal is that Herget was not entitled to an award of an attorney's fee because Rebsamen paid Herget's attorney's fee and Herget is under no obligation to repay Rebsamen. Thus, appellant argues, the trial court's fee award violated two legal concepts: (1) the purpose for statutory awards of attorney's fees is to make whole the prevailing party, not to award him a windfall, and (2) punitive damages in contract actions are not allowed. We reject these arguments.
Appellant cites no authority for his assertion that the purpose of section 16-22-308 is to make whole the prevailing party. The statute itself requires only that, unless otherwise provided by law or the contract which is the subject matter of the action, the movant must have prevailed on the merits of one of the causes of action enumerated in the statute. Further, we are aware of no decisional law or express statement by the General Assembly of its legislative intent respecting the purpose of section 16-22-308 that supports appellant's argument.
Appellant's contention that Herget's fee award is tantamount to punitive damages is merely stated in a conclusory fashion without binding authority or convincing argument. On this record, we decline to address the argument.
The judgment is affirmed.

SPENCER, Special Justice, concurring.
I concur in the decision with one reservation.
This appeal has brought squarely before the court the uncertainty to a losing party of a judgment's finality after the appeal period has expired. In other words, the losing party now remains vulnerable after the appeal period has expired to a motion for an award of attorney's fee.
I concur with the majority opinion not to adopt a rigid rule within the context of this case, but I feel the court should adopt by subsequent order the rule followed by the federal courts requiring the filing of a post judgment motion for an attorney's fee within fourteen (14) days after entry of final judgment in the underlying action as referenced by the second footnote to the majority opinion. Such a rule would avoid the uncertainty on this issue and eliminate the discretionary rule presently existing in our state courts.
Special Justice DONNA C. PETTUS joins in this concurrence.
NOTES
[1]  The pertinent language of section 16-22-308 provides that:

In any civil action to recover on ... contract... for labor or services, or breach of contract, unless otherwise provided by law or the contract which is the subject matter of the action, the prevailing party may be allowed a reasonable attorney's fee to be assessed by the court and collected as costs.
[2]  We are aware that, in 1993, Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(d)(2) was amended to require the filing of a postjudgment motion for an attorney's fee within fourteen days after entry of final judgment on the underlying action, subject to the exceptions enumerated in that rule. It is undisputed, however, that no such rule applies to the present case.

2132043,2132043,1952708,Mears v. State,"Plezz MEARS, Appellant, v. STATE of Indiana, Appellee","

  GIVAN, Justice.
 

  A jury trial resulted in a conviction of appellant of Burglary, a Class C felony, for which he received a sentence of five (5) years, and Theft, a Class D felony, for which he received a sentence of two (2) years, which was enhanced by twenty (20) years by reason of his status as an habitual offender, the sentences to run concurrently-
 

  The facts are: Kern Lankford owned the West Indies Gem Trading Company on the gallery level of the City Market in Indianapolis. Adjoining the gem trading company was Warren Tailors where appellant was employed. Lankford and appellant were acquainted. On December 9,. 1986, appellant entered Lankford’s shop and examined some gold chains, indicating he was interested in making a purchase. That night, at the close of business, Lankford locked his shop. He testified that appellant did not have permission to enter his shop after it was closed.
 

  The following morning, at approximately 7:30, Lawrence Spector was in the process of opening Libby’s Delicatessen on the lower level of the market. His attention was called to the West Indies Gem Trading Company on the upper level where he saw appellant behind the display counter. As Spector watched, appellant came around the counter and dropped down on the floor by the security gate which protected the business. Terry Sanchez, who was also watching appellant, heard the gate rattling as appellant forced it up sufficiently to allow him to roll beneath it.
 

  When Lankford arrived, he discovered that some gold chains were missing. Detective Bolinger arrived to investigate, and after hearing the above facts, he obtained the address of appellant. He went to appellant’s home, knocked on the door, and a female who, evidence later disclosed, was fourteen years of age, answered the door. Bolinger asked if Mears were present, and the girl opened the door wider and gestured toward appellant who was sitting on a couch.
 

  Bolinger entered and as he engaged appellant in conversation he noticed six gold chains lying on the coffee table directly in front of appellant. Appellant’s girl friend, who was the mother of the fourteen-year-old girl who answered the door, also gave Detective Bolinger a gold chain which she was wearing around her neck. Bolinger then arrested appellant.
 

  Appellant first claims he was subjected to double jeopardy by reason of the fact the trial court had sustained his motion for a new trial when a prosecutor’s intern, in closing argument to the jury, stated that the State had the responsibility of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant was guilty. He further stated that the State had done so, and the defendant had not done anything to rebut the State’s proof of guilt whereupon defendant made a motion for mistrial which was granted by the trial court.
 

  Appellant cites
  
   Crim v. State
  
  (1973), 156 Ind.App. 66, 294 N.E.2d 822 for the propo
   
   *142
   
  sition that when the cause of the mistrial is prosecutorial error, jeopardy will attach. This type of Situation was recognized by the Supreme Court of the United States in
  
   Oregon v. Kennedy
  
  (1982), 456 U.S. 667, 102 S.Ct. 2083, 72 L.Ed.2d 416. However, the attachment of jeopardy was limited to those cases where it was apparent the prosecuting attorney deliberately provoked the defendant into moving for a mistrial in order to obtain a new trial when things had not gone well for the State in the first instance.
 

  This proposition of law also was recognized by this Court in
  
   Woods v. State
  
  (1985), Ind., 484 N.E.2d 3. This matter was placed squarely before the trial court at the commencement of the prosecution in the instant case. However, the trial court, after hearing argument of counsel, denied the motion for discharge on the ground of double jeopardy. There is nothing in this record to indicate that the State had encountered any difficulty in the prosecution of appellant to warrant any supposition that the State was deliberately attempting to create error to gain a new trial. The remark of the intern at most was a poor choice of words which justified the trial court in ordering a new trial upon appellant’s motion.
 

  We see nothing in this record which brings the case within the parameter of deliberate provocation on the part of the State in order to gain a new trial. We find no error in the trial court’s denying the motion for discharge on grounds of former jeopardy.
 

  Appellant claims the trial court erred in denying him his motion to suppress evidence obtained when Detective Bolinger entered his home. He claims that inasmuch as Bolinger had neither an arrest warrant for him or a warrant to search his home, his entry and subsequent seizure of the contraband goods was illegal; thus, all of such evidence should have been suppressed. He takes the position that a fourteen-year-old girl could not consent to a search of the premises. Although he concedes that a third person with common authority over the premises may consent to a search, citing
  
   Brooks v. State
  
  (1986), Ind., 497 N.E.2d 210, he takes the position that the fourteen-year-old girl, although a resident of the home, was not of sufficient age to give consent for the search.
 

  We would point out, however, that no search occurred in this case nor was one requested. Detective Bolinger merely knocked on the door and asked if appellant were present. In fact, Detective Bolinger was only in the preliminary stages of his investigation and at the time was seeking to discuss what facts he did have with appellant. Although it was the fourteen-year-old girl who opened the door for appellant, she did so in the presence of her mother and appellant. When Bolinger inquired as to the presence of appellant, the girl merely gestured toward appellant who was in plain view, and Bolinger entered without any objection from either appellant or the girl’s mother. No search was conducted, the necklaces were in plain view on a coffee table directly in front of appellant who was seated on a couch. The girl’s mother voluntarily removed a gold chain from her neck and gave it to Detective Bolinger.
 

  We see nothing from the facts in this case which would require Detective Bolinger to have either an arrest warrant or a search warrant. Bolinger made no request to search the premises nor was any such permission given by the girl. The facts in this case merely demonstrate a consensual entry into the home and the recovery of contraband goods which were in plain view when the detective entered the room. Objects which are in plain view of an officer when seized are not the product of a search.
  
   Gann v. State of Indiana
  
  (1988), Ind., 521 N.E.2d 330.
 

  The trial court did not err in refusing to suppress the evidence.
 

  Appellant claims the jury verdict finding him guilty of both burglary and theft was not supported by sufficient evidence. He first claims there was no proof that anyone broke into and entered the West Indies Gem Trading Company. We cannot agree with appellant’s observation in this regard. There was direct evidence
   
   *143
   
  of the witnesses who saw appellant in the place of business where he had no right to be at a time when that business was closed. While the witnesses watched, appellant exited the business by displacing a security gate sufficiently to allow him to squeeze under it.
 

  The jury was entitled to believe he gained entrance in the same fashion. In order to constitute a breaking, it is not necessary that there be a fracturing or injury to a material part of the building such as a door or window. Breaking includes the putting aside of any material part of the building intended as security against invasion. In the case at bar, forcing himself under the security gate was sufficient to constitute a breaking.
  
   See Barrick v. State
  
  (1954), 233 Ind. 333, 119 N.E.2d 550.
 

  Appellant also claims there is lack of proof of the ownership of the allegedly stolen property which was found in his possession. Appellant bases his contention on the fact that when Lankford was testifying in behalf of the State he was shown a photograph of the necklaces which were recovered from appellant’s home. He stated it was difficult for him to identify the necklaces in the photograph as those taken from his place of business. However, it was also established from the evidence that when Detective Bolinger recovered the necklaces from appellant’s home he took them to Lankford who upon directly examining the necklaces identified them as being the ones missing from his place of business.
 

  The fact that Lankford could not identify the necklaces positively from photographs but identified them when returned by Detective Bolinger was a question placed before the jury, from which they had a right to make a factual determination as to the identification of the allegedly stolen property. The evidence was ample for them to make the determination that the property found in appellant’s home was in fact the property taken from Lankford’s place of business.
 

  Appellant claims the trial court committed reversible error when it first read the charging affidavit concerning the habitual offender charge to the jury and stated that there were three prior felony convictions, when in fact as the trial progressed, the court ruled that a former Kentucky conviction should not be placed before the jury because of insufficient records. Although this left the statutory requirement of two prior convictions before the jury, appellant argues that since the court had erroneously informed the jury there would be three former convictions and only two former convictions materialized the jury was thus misled and prejudiced against him.
 

  However, after the court ruled that the Kentucky conviction could not be established, the trial judge instructed the jury that they were to disregard his statement concerning three prior convictions. The fact remains that although only two prior convictions are necessary for the jury to find that a defendant is an habitual offender, the fact that the State may plead and prove more than two prior convictions is merely surplusage.
  
   St. Mociers v. State
  
  (1984), Ind., 459 N.E.2d 26;
  
   Hensley v. State
  
  (1983), Ind., 448 N.E.2d 665.
 

  Appellant also claims there was no evidence of probative value that he was the same person who had been convicted previously. As appellant himself concedes, his fingerprints were matched with those in the records presented by the State to establish the former convictions. However, appellant claims in addition to such evidence there should be eyewitness testimony that he is the same person as that person who was formerly convicted. Such contention was rejected by this Court in
  
   Sapp v. State
  
  (1987), Ind., 513 N.E.2d 178 and
  
   Meredith v. State
  
  (1987), Ind., 503 N.E.2d 880.
 

  Appellant also contends that one of the prior convictions was for theft of less than $100 for which he received a sentence of less than one year. He concedes that this Court has held that such convictions are felony convictions, citing
  
   McBrady v. State
  
  (1984), Ind., 459 N.E.2d 719;
  
   Underhill v. State
  
  (1981), Ind., 428 N.E.2d 759. The
   
   *144
   
  evidence in this case clearly indicated that appellant had in fact been twice previously convicted of felonies.
 

  Appellant also claims that the record submitted by the State did not establish that the second prior felony was committed after he had been sentenced for the first prior felony. However, the record indicates that the information filed in 1977 for theft shows that the crime was committed on March 14, 1977 and that appellant was sentenced for said crime on July 20, 1977. The 1978 crime of robbery was shown to have been committed in November of 1978 and appellant was sentenced for that crime in June of 1979. Thus the State’s evidence complies with the statutory requirement.
 

  The trial court is affirmed.

MEMORANDUM DECISION
NICHOL, Chief Judge.
These cases were brought in the name of the United States on the relation of Robert Burnette against the named defendants, all conceded to be United States Government employees, alleging that the defendants had engaged in trading with Indians in violation of Section 68 of Title 25 of the United States Code Annotated (hereinafter referred to as U.S. C.A.), which provides as follows:

Employees not to trade with Indians

No person employed in Indian affairs shall have any interest or concern in any trade with the Indians, ex*313cept for, and on account of, the United States; and any person offending herein, shall be liable to a penalty of $5,-000, and shall be removed from his office.
This statute was enacted June 30, 1834. Its harshness has been reduced by later enactments. Section 68a of Title 25, U.S.C.A., duplicated in Section 87a of the same Title, and passed by Congress June 19, 1939, prohibits trading with Indians by United States Government employees as follows:
* * * purchases from Indians by employees
Anything contained in sections 68 and 87 of this title to the contrary notwithstanding, employees of the United States Government, including those in the Indian Service, may, under such rules and regulations as the Secretary of the Interior shall prescribe, be permitted to purchase from any Indian or Indian organization any arts and crafts or any other product, service, or commodity, produced, rendered, owned, controlled, or furnished by any Indian or Indian organization: Provided, however, That no employee of the United States Government shall be permitted to make any such purchases for the purpose of engaging directly or indirectly in the commercial selling, reselling, trading, or bartering of said purchases by the said employee. June 19, 1939, c. 210, 53 Stat. 840.
The scope of permissible actions involving trade between Indians and United States Government employees has also been altered by Sections 251.5 and 251.-6 of Title 25 of the Code of Federal Regulations (hereinafter referred to as CFR). These Sections provide in part:
Section 251.5 Government employees not to trade with Indians except in certain cases.
Save as authorized by the act of June 19, 1939 (53 Stat. 840; 25 U.S.C. 68a, 87a, 441), no person employed in Indian affairs shall have any interest or concern in any trade with the Indians except for and on account of the United States; and any person offending herein shall be liable to a penalty of $5,-000 and shall be removed from his office. Pending the promulgation of regulations prescribing in more detail the transactions authorized by the act of June 19, 1939, employees of the United States Government, including those in the Bureau of Indian Affairs, may be permitted to trade with' Indians or Indian organizations under the conditions specified below:
(a) Employees of the United States Government, including those in the Bureau of Indian Affairs may, with the approval of the Secretary of the Interior in each case where the amount exceeds $100, or with the approval of the superintendent or other officer in charge, where the amount involved does not exceed $100, be permitted to purchase from any Indian or Indian organization any arts and crafts or any other product, service or commodity produced, rendered, owned, controlled or furnished by any Indian or Indian organization: Provided, That no employee of the United States Government shall be permitted to make any such purchases for the purpose of engaging directly or indirectly in the commercial selling, reselling, trading, or bartering of said purchases by the said employee: And provided further, That employees in Alaska may in each case make such purchases with the approval of the Secretary of the Interior where the amount involved exceeds $250, and with the approval of the superintendent or other officer in charge where the amount involved does not exceed $250.
(b) United States employees, Indian blood. Indian employees of the United States Government, of whatever degree of Indian blood, may be members in the same manner as other Indian members of the tribe not so employed and receive benefits by reason of their membership in such tribes in corporation or cooperative associations, organized by and operated for Indians. Such Indian government em*314ployees may engage in all lawful transactions with Indians, Indian tribes and such corporations or cooperative associations. None of the transactions authorized herein may be entered into by such employees for the purpose of engaging directly or indirectly in the selling, releasing, trading, bartering or passing on in any other way for profit the objects, rights, services or property thus acquired. Nothing in this section shall prevent in proper cases the disposition of any such property when such transaction cannot be considered as actually engaging in any of the businesses prohibited in this section. All transactions authorized herein to be valid must be approved by the Secretary of the Interior. * * *
Section 251.6 Small purchases.
The purchase in small quantities for home use or consumption by Government employees or others, of blankets, baskets, etc., and articles of subsistence offered for sale by Indians, is held not to constitute trading with Indians within the meaning of section 2078 of the Revised Statutes. (R.S. 2078; 25 U.S.C. 68)
The four cases have been consolidated for the purposes of trial to and written decision by the Court.
In reaching the decisions in these cases, the Court found it necessary to define the terms “trade” and “commercial.” The interpretation of the term “trade” as used in the statute herein involved was carefully considered in United States v. Douglas, 190 F. 482, 484, 36 L.R.A.,N.S., 1075 (8th Cir. 1911). The Court stated in part:
There is little if any conflict as to the usual and ordinary meaning of the word “trade.” It is defined in Webster’s International Dictionary as: “The act or business of exchanging commodities by barter or by buying and selling for money; commerce; traffic; barter.”
The Century Dictionary defines it as: “The exchange of commodities for other commodities or for money. The business of buying or selling, dealing by way of exchange, commerce, traffic. Trade comprehends every species of exchange or dealing either in the produce of land, in manufactures, or in bills or money.”
In the New American Encyclopaedic Dictionary it is defined as: “The act, occupation or business of exchanging commodities for other commodities or for money. The business of buying and selling; dealing by way of sale or exchange; commerce; traffic.”
In Bouvier’s Law Dictionary it is said: “In its most extensive signification the word includes all sorts of dealings by way of sale or exchange.”
In Rapalje and Lawrence’s Law Dictionary it is defined as: “Traffic; commerce; exchange of goods for other goods or for money.”
In 28 American and English Encyclopaedia of Law, 338, it is said: “In ordinary language the word ‘trade’ is employed in three different senses: First, in that of the business of buying and selling; second, in that of an occupation generally; and, third, in that of a mechanical employment in contradistinction to agriculture and the liberal arts.” * * *
In 15A C.J.S. 1, the word “commercial” is defined as follows:
The word “commercial” is defined as meaning mercantile; occupied with commerce; relating to or dealing with commerce; of the nature of commerce; of or pertaining to commerce; pertaining or relating to commerce or trade; derived by commerce or trade; engaged in trade; having financial profit as the primary aim.
The term “commercial”, in its broad sense comprehends all business and industrial enterprises, and in a comprehensive sense it includes occupations and recognized forms of business enterprise which do not necessarily involve trading in merchandise as well as buying, selling, and exchange in the general sales or traffic of markets, although, when limited to *315the purchase and sale or exchange of goods and commodities, it is said to be used in a narrow and restricted sense. Thus it has been said that in its narrow sense it includes only those enterprises which are engaged in the buying and selling of goods.
CIV66-74W
The basis for the complaint is as follows:
IV.
That on or about the 5th day of April, 1963, at Rosebud, South Dakota, the defendant Vetal Valandra induced one Irene Stoneman Blue Horse, at a time when she was under the influence of intoxicating liquor, to transfer to him all of her interest in the following described real estate:
NORTHWEST QUARTER (NW&) OF SECTION TWENTY-SIX (26) AND THE SOUTHWEST QUARTER (SW&) OF SECTION TWENTY-THREE (23), TOWNSHIP 39N, RANGE 29W OF THE SIXTH PRINCIPAL MERIDIAN ON THE ROSEBUD INDIAN RESERVATION,
which land was then and is now held in trust by the United States of America.
V.
That at Rosebud, South Dakota, the above transfer was immediately approved by the defendant Harold Schunk, as Superintendent of the Rosebud Indian Reservation at Rosebud, South Dakota, by executing in writing his approval thereof; that the said defendant Harold Schunk well knew at the time he approved said transfer that said Vetal Valandra was an employee in Indian affairs and was prohibited by law from trading with Indians; and well knew at said time that Irene Julia Stoneman Blue Horse was an Indian and a registered member of the tribe of Sioux Indians located on the Rosebud Indian Reservation in South Dakota, and that she was a ward of the United States. That the said transfer was not approved by the Secretary of the Interior, was null and void, and declared to be so by proper authority.
VI.
That the said Harold Schunk, well knowing that the said Vetal Valandra was employed in Indian affairs, that the said described land so transferred was trust land, and that the said Irene Julia Stoneman Blue' Horse was a ward of the United States, conspired unlawfully with the said Vetal Valandra to procure the land above described from the said Irene Julia Stoneman Blue Horse for the use and benefit of the said Vetal Valandra.
The Court, upon concession by plaintiff’s attorneys that they did not have sufficient proof to sustain this action against defendant Harold Schunk, entered an order of dismissal with prejudice as to defendant Schunk.
The main cause for complaint is that a transaction that had to be approved by the Department of Interior did not gain that approval. The Department of Interior did not give the transaction approval because of misrepresentations that had been made — -those being that Vetal Valandra was the nephew of the TLE certificates owner, Mrs. Irene Julia Stoneman Blue Horse, now Mrs. Eagle Bear, and that said certificates were a gift when in actuality said transfer was the result of a sale. The Department of Interior made no finding of fact as to the perpetrator of the misrepresentation. It is the finding of this Court, after hearing all the evidence, that said misrepresentation was not made at the instigation of defendant Vetal Valandra, and that simply because the Department of Interior failed to approve a transaction which it had the power to approve would not prove that any involved party had violated Federal law.
Defendant Valandra made application for approval for said transaction, it was turned down, and the land and the TLE certificates restored to their own*316er. The act of defendant Vetal Valandra in making application for approval of said transaction is not a violation of Section 68 of Title 25 U.S.C.A.
CIV66-75W
The basis for the complaint is as follows:
II.
That on or about July 7, 1966, the defendant Vetal Valandra procured a haying permit of the tribal land known as Rosebud Boarding School lands, which lands constitute a part of Rosebud Indian Reservation in South Dakota, containing in excess of 1005 acres.
IV.
Plaintiff states, upon information and belief, that the said land was advertised for public bids and that all bids were rejected by the defendant Cato Valandra, President of the Tribal Council of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe of Indians, and that the said Cato Valandra is a first cousin of the said Vetal Valandra. That the said Defendants Vetal Valandra, Cato Valandra and Harold Schunk negotiated the said permit at a price far below a fair price; that the land was leased for the amount of one dollar per acre, and the value of the hay removed from the premises during the 1966 season amounted to about $15,000.00.
VI.
That, upon information and belief, plaintiff states that the said Cato Valandra, Vetal Valandra and Harold Schunk conspired together, contrary to law, to give a haying permit of said property in the name of the said Vetal Valandra.
The Court, upon concession by plaintiff’s attorneys that they did not have sufficient proof to sustain this action against defendants Cato Valandra and Harold Schunk, entered an order of dismissal with prejudice as to those defendants.
The evidence introduced to substantiate this claim did not indicate that the Tribal Council must advertise such hay land for bids, nor do the Constitution, By-Laws and Corporate Charter of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe so provide. No evidence was introduced that the price paid, one dollar per acre, was not the fair market price at the time of this incident.
The testimony of Adam Bordeaux, the Tribal Leasing Committee officer at whose request defendant Vetal Valandra entered into said agreement to cut the hay in question, would indicate that Vetal Valandra cut this hay at the request of and as a favor to the Tribe. Bordeaux’s testimony also indicated that no other individual had been found to cut this hay. This would, in effect, amount to accepting employment from the Tribe at its request. It should also be pointed out that the arrangement was approved by the leasing committee for the Tribal Land Enterprises of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe as well as by Harold Schunk, Superintendent of the Rosebud Indian Agency.
These facts would not indicate that defendant Vetal Valandra was engaging in trade with Indians contrary to Section 68 or 68a of Title 25 U.S.C.A.
CIV66-76W
The basis for the complaint is as follows:
III.
That on or about the 20th day of September, 1964, the said defendant Vetal Valandra purchased a barn from Charles Little Eagle, an Indian and an enrolled member of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe of Indians, for the sum of $125.-00 and resold said barn to Alex Whipple, Jr., for the sum of $225.00, in violation of Section 68 of Title 25 of the United States Code Annotated.
The evidence introduced to substantiate this charge included a check from defendant Vetal Valandra to Charles Little Eagle in the sum of $150.00, dated October 17, 1963. The complaint was *317thereafter amended to conform to this evidence. Also put into evidence was a check from Alex Whipple, Jr., in the sum of $225.00, dated October 18, 1968. Testimony from both Whipple and defendant Valandra indicated that the additional $75.00 paid to Valandra by Whipple was payment for hay previously received from Valandra. Valandra testified that he only purchased the barn as a go-between, acting on behalf of Whipple, and that he was reimbursed the amount of the $150.00 purchase price by Whipple. Whipple’s corroborative testimony also indicates that Valandra was acting on Whipple’s behalf and that only $150.00 was paid for the barn to Valandra. The one day time sequence between the involved cheeks would also verify defendant’s testimony.
The facts above, as found by the Court, would not indicate that Valandra was engaging in trade with Indians contrary to Section 68 or 68a of Title 25 U.S.C.A., but would rather indicate that Valandra was assisting a neighbor purchase a desired building. There is no evidence to indicate that Valandra purchased the barn for any other reason than to assist Whipple and that he, by so doing, was engaging in a commercial venture contrary to Federal law.
CIV66-77W
The basis for the complaint is as follows:
III.
That on or about the 18th day of December, 1965, the said defendant purchased three heifer calves from Arthur Jackson, a registered member of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe of Indians, for Seventy Dollars ($70.00) per head, and resold them at the Valentine, Nebraska, Sales Ring, in violation of Section 68 of Title 25 United States Code Annotated.
The complaint was amended to read December 5, 1965.
The evidence introduced in support of the complaint included two cheeks written by defendant Vetal Valandra. One check was to Arthur Jackson in the sum of $70.00 with the notation of “one steer black” accompanied by a brand symbol. The other check was written in favor of one Abram Ovitt, a non-Indian, in the sum of $140.00 with the notation of “two black calves”, which notation was also accompanied by brand symbols. Both checks were dated December 4, 1965.
The only evidence as to the disposition of the steer calf purchased from Jackson was the uncontroverted testimony of defendant Valandra that he was not certain what he had done with it, but likely he had butchered the animal because it was a runt. The defendant further testified that he had purchased the calves sight-unseen from Jackson and Ovitt, Jackson’s non-Indian son-in-law, at their request. Jackson had injured himself and wanted the money to enter the hospital at Rapid City, South Dakota.
The evidence introduced would indicate that defendant Valandra did not trade with Indians in violation of Section 68 of 25 U.S.C.A., but rather engaged in a transaction clearly allowable under an exception provided for in 25 CFR 251.5(a) and (b) making a purchase of a “product, service or commodity produced, rendered, owned, controlled or furnished by any Indian or Indian organization” where the amount did not exceed $100.00. No testimony was introduced to indicate that the price paid was not adequate consideration in this instance, nor was that issue even raised.
The foregoing shall constitute the findings of fact and conclusions of law as to all four cases.

   OPINION
  


  RICHARD MILLS, District Judge.
 

  Different parties.
 

  But, the same claim.
 

 
   *999
   
  And, the same lack of evidence.
 

  So, the same result.
 

  Summary judgment is granted as to all Defendants.
 

  I. BACKGROUND
 

  In December 1998, two stationary engineer positions became available in the power plant at the Illinois Department of Corrections’ (“IDOC”) Logan Correctional Center in Lincoln, Illinois. Announcements for these two vacant stationary engineer positions were posted that same month. Plaintiff Charles Coffey, Edward Jankauski, Jeffrey Short, and several other candidates applied for these positions and were interviewed by IDOC employees in early 1999. However, no candidates were ever hired as a result of these interviews.
 

  On June 1, 1999, Defendant James Cox became the Warden of the Logan Correctional Center. In August 1999, Defendant Michael Stang
  
   1
  
  and Warden Cox learned that the two stationary engineer positions were still vacant, and they agreed that the positions should be filled quickly for economic reasons.
 

  Accordingly, Warden Cox directed his personnel office to post a position-opening announcement describing the two stationary engineer positions and listing them as being available. This announcement was posted later that same month. Eleven candidates applied for the positions, including Coffey, Short, and Jankauski.
 

  Warden Cox selected Defendants Joseph Galassi and James Simmons to interview the candidates for the stationary engineer positions because he knew that both of them had been trained as to the meaning and requirements of the United States Supreme Court’s decision in
  
   Rutan v. Republican Party of Illinois,
  
  497 U.S. 62, 110 S.Ct. 2729, 111 L.Ed.2d 52 (1990), and because he knew that both of them had previously conducted interviews for IDOC.
  
   2
  
  Galassi and Simmons were provided with copies of a pre-existing interview questionnaire which contained questions to be asked during the stationary engineer interviews.' Neither Galassi nor Simmons received any recommendations, political or otherwise, on behalf of any of the applicants for the stationary engineer positions, nor did they learn of any such recommendations.
  
   3
  


 
   *1000
   
  All eleven applicants were scheduled to be interviewed on September 1, 1999.
  
   4
  
  During the interviews, Galassi and Simmons asked each applicant an identical set of questions from the pre-existing interview questionnaire relating to the candidates’ experience and qualifications for the stationary engineer positions. Paul Givens, who at the time was the chief engineer responsible for supervising all of the power plant employees at the Logan Correctional Center, attended some of the interviews and assisted Galassi and Simmons by advising them regarding the appropriate answers to certain technical questions on the questionnaire. However, Givens did not score the candidates’ answers or assist in any way with the ranking of the candidates. In addition, none of the candidates were questioned about politics, political support, political affiliation, or political activities at any time during the application or interview process.
 

  Sometime during the first week of September 1999, Tami Williams, Logan Correctional Center’s human resource coordinator, calculated a weighted score for each applicant by applying a prescribed formula to the combined scores assigned by Galassi and Simmons. The scores and comments regarding each candidate were recorded on a “Candidate Evaluation Form.” The top five candidates scored as follows: (1) Jeffrey Short: 16.9; (2) Edward Jan-kauski: 13.95; (3) Jackie Hurley: 12; (4)(tied) David Fleshman: 9.3; and (5)(tied) Charles Coffey: 9.3.
 

  Thereafter, Warden Cox contacted Stang and recommended Short and Jan-kauski for the stationary engineer positions. Stang accepted Warden Cox’s recommendations, and Short and Jankauski were offered the positions. Warden Cox then informed the other candidates by letter that they had not been selected for the positions.
 

  On March 2, 2001, Coffey filed the above-captioned case, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging that Warden Cox, Galassi, and Simmons violated his First Amendment rights by failing to award him one of the stationary engineer positions at the Logan Correctional Center. Specifically, Coffey alleges that Warden Cox, Galassi, and Simmons filled the positions on the basis of political considerations in violation of his First and Fourteenth Amendment rights and the United States Supreme Court’s holding in
  
   Rutan.
  
  On September 7, 2002, Coffey amended his Complaint to add identical allegations against Stang. Defendants have now moved for summary judgment pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c).
 

  II. STANDARD FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
 

  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c) provides that summary judgment “shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 56(c);
  
   see Ruiz-Rivera v. Moyer,
  
  70 F.3d 498, 500-01 (7th Cir.1995). The moving party has the burden of providing proper documentary evidence to show the absence of a
   
   *1001
   
  genuine issue of material fact.
  
   Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477
  
  U.S. 317, 323-24, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). A genuine issue of material fact exists when “there is sufficient evidence favoring the nonmoving party for a jury to return a verdict for that party.”
  
   Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477
  
  U.S. 242, 249, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986).
 

  In determining whether a genuine issue of material fact exists, the Court must consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.
  
   Adickes v. S.H. Kress & Co.,
  
  398 U.S. 144, 157, 90 S.Ct. 1598, 26 L.Ed.2d 142 (1970). Once the moving party has met its burden, the opposing party must come forward with specific evidence, not mere allegations or denials of the pleadings, which demonstrates that there is a genuine issue for trial.
  
   Gracia v. Volvo Europa Truck, N.V.,
  
  112 F.3d 291, 294 (7th Cir.1997).
 

  III. ANALYSIS
 

  The facts in this case are strikingly similar to the facts set forth in a published Opinion from this Court,
  
   Winkelman v. Magne,
  
  173 F.Supp.2d 821 (C.D.Ill.2001), and the facts in an unpublished order from the United States District Court for the Southern District of Illinois.
  
   Wilkie v. Obourn,
  
  2002 WL 338401 (S.D.Ill. Jan.7, 2002)(Gilbert, J.). In essence, the plaintiffs in all three cases are not awarded a position within IDOC for which they have applied, and so, they run to the nearest federal courthouse to file a
  
   Rutan
  
  action alleging that impermissible political patronage was afoot. Although they cannot produce any direct evidence of discriminatory intent (more on that later), these plaintiffs purport to rely upon “circumstantial evidence” of a First Amendment violation, and they ask the court to disregard settled law establishing the framework for interpreting First Amendment claims and to apply, instead, the framework applicable to Title VII cases because it is so closely analogous to their claims.
  
   5
  


  In the instant case, Coffey argues that, if the Court accepts Defendants’ position, the only way in which a would-be plaintiff attempting to maintain a
  
   Rutan
  
  claim can survive summary judgment is to produce direct evidence of discriminatory intent by the defendant,
  
   i.e.,
  
  a confession by a defendant. Coffey asserts that a
  
   Rutan
  
  plaintiff may prove his case by circumstantial evidence and also asserts that the circumstantial evidence of Defendants’ discriminatory intent which he has tendered is sufficient to preclude the Court from entering summary judgment against him. Finally, Coffey suggests to the Court that it should apply the
  
   McDonnell Douglas
  
  burden-shifting analysis to his First Amendment claim.
 

  Coffey’s “circumstantial evidence” takes two forms.
  
   First,
  
  Coffey asserts that Short did not meet the specified job requirements to qualify for the stationary engineer position. Specifically, Coffey claims that Short did not have four years experience working with high pressure boilers. Because Short was not qualified for the position and because Short was certainly not as qualified as he was, Coffey contends that a reasonable jury could conclude that political considerations affected the hiring process.
  
   6
  



   Second,
  
  Coffey contends that the manner in which Defendants filled the stationary engineer positions is suspicious and raises an inference that political affiliations and activities were considered during the hiring process. Specifically, Coffey claims:
   
   *1002
   
  (1) although the Logan Correctional Center maintained a long established tradition of hiring the most senior boil washer (assuming he wanted the job) to fill vacant stationary engineer positions, the policy was not followed in this case; (2) the first time that the stationary engineer positions were posted in early 1999, the Assistant Warden of Logan Correctional Center— Dan Sexton — received pressure from then Warden Bosse to hire someone with political connections; (3)the fact that Givens was not present during Short’s second interview and, thus, could not provide insight into the correctness of Short’s answers to technical questions, lends credence to his claim; (4) the fact that Galassi and Simmons did not immediately score the interviews but waited a few days thereafter raises an inference that the two compared results; (5) the e-mail message from Warden Cox to Stang requesting “direction” could lead a jury to conclude that he was asking Stang who should get the job; and (6) the fact that Galassi and Simmons gave inconsistent scores/grades for the same answers to the interview questions raises an inference of discriminatory intent, especially because they did so in Short’s favor. Coffey argues that, based upon this circumstantial evidence, a reasonable jury could find that he did not receive one of the stationary engineer positions at the Logan Correctional Center because of his political connections, affiliations, and/or activities (or lack thereof), and therefore, the Court should deny Defendants’ motion for summary judgment.
 

  Initially, the Court notes that it is unsure as to why Coffey’s counsel eontin-ues to implore this Court and other district courts to apply the
  
   McDonnell Douglas
  
  test in situations such as this, knowing full well that it would be improper for the courts to do so.
  
   See Winkelman,
  
  173 F.Supp.2d at 825;
  
   see also Wilkie,
  
  2002 WL 338401 at *5;
  
   see also Deheve v. Price,
  
  189 F.Supp.2d 830, 834 n. 5 (C.D.Ill.2002).
  
   7
  
  The Court is even more troubled by Coffey’s counsel’s assertion that her response applies “applicable law.” The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit has unmistakably held that “[fjacts suggesting that a qualified person of one type was fired, and a person of another type was hired make out a
  
   prima facie
  
  case of race or sex discrimination, but they do not suffice to show discrimination based on political association.”
  
   Garrett v. Barnes,
  
  961 F.2d 629, 632 (7th Cir.1992);
  
   see Nelms v. Modisett,
  
  153 F.3d 815, 818 n. 4 (7th Cir.1998) (same). “Whatever may be the case under labor and civil rights statutes,
  
   Mt. Healthy
  
  establishes the approach for litigation under the first amendment.”
  
   Gooden v. Neal,
  
  17 F.3d 925, 928 (7th Cir.1994).
 

  Coffey’s counsel does not even attempt to distinguish
  
   Nelms, Garrett,
  
  and/or
  
   Goo-den
  
  factually or legally, nor has she cited any cases which are contrary to the holdings in those cases. Moreover, although counsel may always argue for a change in the law, Coffey’s counsel does not attempt to make such an argument other than to say that there is no justification for a distinction between the manner in which First Amendment patronage claims are analyzed versus Title VII race, gender, etc. claims are analyzed.
  
   8
  

   See A.O. Smith Corp. v. Lewis, Overbeck & Furman,
  
  979
   
   *1003
   
  F.2d 546, 551 (7th Cir.1992)(holding that “[w]hatever the failings of
  
   Sandburg Village,
  
  attorneys in this Circuit are bound by all the decisions of this Court, not just those they deem consonant with Supreme Court doctrine. The correct remedy in such circumstances is to petition for certio-rari, or to argue in good faith for a change in the law — but the remedy is not simply to ignore the precedent.”).
 

  But to say that there should be no distinction between the analysis under the First and Fourteenth Amendments is really not an argument for a change in the law. Title VII, as an Act of Congress, provides for a private cause of action, and the Supreme Court has held that a would-be plaintiff may employ the burden shifting method established by that court in
  
   McDonnell Douglas
  
  to prove his
  
   prima facie
  
  case. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e
  
   et seq.; see Veprinsky v. Fluor Daniel, Inc.,
  
  87 F.3d 881, 889 (7th Cir.1996)(noting that “the private right of action remains an essential means of obtaining judicial enforcement of Title VIL”). On the other hand, in order to bring a
  
   Rutan
  
  patronage claim under the First Amendment, a due process claim under the Fourteenth Amendment, or an equal protection claim under the Fourteenth Amendment, a would-be plaintiff must use the statutory mechanism of 42 U.S.C. § 1983.
  
   See Tarpley v. Keistler,
  
  188 F.3d 788, 797 (7th Cir.1999)(noting that “[t]o state a § 1983 claim based on a Fourteenth Amendment violation — as here, where Tarpley claims that Keistler violated his First Amendment rights as applied to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment — the challenged conduct must also constitute state action.”);
  
   see also Schroeder v. Hamilton Sch. Dist.,
  
  282 F.3d 946, 951 (7th Cir.2002) (holding that “ § 1983 does not provide a remedy for rights created under Title VIL”). The two statutes address different Congressional concerns and, as such, are analyzed distinctly by the federal courts.
 

  Thus, the Court will not analyze Coffey’s case under the
  
   McDonnell Douglas
  
  burden — shifting framework; rather, the Court will follow binding precedent from the Seventh Circuit and will apply the
  
   Mt. Healthy
  
  test to Coffey’s claim. As the Seventh Circuit has explained:
 

  In order to establish a
  
   prima facie
  
  case of politically motivated discharge, [a plaintiff] must “prove by a preponderance of the evidence that his conduct was constitutionally protected, and that the protected conduct was a substantial factor in the decision to terminate him.”
  
   Garrett v. Barnes,
  
  961 F.2d 629, 632 (7th Cir.1992). As we have noted, “[t]hat burden is not insignificant. A disgruntled employee fired for legitimate reasons would not be able to satisfy his burden merely by showing that he carried the political card of the opposition party or that he favored the defendant’s opponent in the election.”
  
   Nekolny v. Painter,
  
  653 F.2d 1164, 1168 (7th Cir.1981),
  
   certiorari denied,
  
  455 U.S. 1021, 102 S.Ct. 1719, 72 L.Ed.2d 139. If [a plaintiff] is able to demonstrate that his political affiliation was a motivating factor in his termination, the burden then shifts to defendants to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that they had a legitimate, non-political reason for terminating him in order to avoid liability.
  
   Garrett,
  
  961 F.2d at 632.
 


   Nelms v. Modisett,
  
  153 F.3d 815, 818 (7th Cir.1998)(footnote omitted);
  
   see Tarpley v. Jeffers,
  
  96 F.3d 921, 928 (7th Cir.1996),
  
   quoting Mt. Healthy City Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle,
  
  429 U.S. 274, 287, 97 S.Ct. 568, 50 L.Ed.2d 471 (1977)(holding that “the employee must first prove by a preponderance of the evidence that political affiliation was a ‘motivating factor’ in the employment decision. If the employee carries that burden, the employer then bears the burden of showing that ‘it would
   
   *1004
   
  have reached the same decision as to respondent’s [ Employment even in the absence of the protected conduct.’ ”).
 

  In the present case, Coffey has failed to tender any evidence that his political affiliations, activities, and/or associations (or lack thereof) were a substantial or a motivating factor in Defendants’ decision not to offer him one of the stationary engineer positions at the Logan Correctional Center. Contrary to Coffey’s assertions otherwise, the Court is not requiring him or any
  
   Rutan
  
  plaintiff to offer direct evidence, or more to the point a confession by Defendants, in order to survive summary judgment. Although such direct evidence would certainly result in the denial of a motion for summary judgment, proffering circumstantial evidence can also lead to this result.
 

  “However, the circumstantial evidence must do more than simply ‘raise some eyebrows’; it must be sufficient to raise a jury question about the role of the political factors.”
  
   Wilkie,
  
  2002 WL 338401 at * 7,
  
   citing Tarpley,
  
  96 F.3d at 930. Coffey’s circumstantial evidence fails to do little more than raise a single eyebrow.
 

  The fact that Short may not have been qualified or as qualified for the stationary engineer position as Coffey was, without more, is insufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact precluding summary judgment. “In political patronage cases, the defendant [sic-plaintiff] must show as part of his
  
   prima facie
  
  case a causal connection between his political association or activities and the hiring decision; simply proving that he was qualified, or more qualified than others, for the job without some nexus with his political activities is not enough.”
  
   Wilkie,
  
  2002 WL 338401 at * 5,
  
   citing Garrett,
  
  961 F.2d at 633. “The law is clear that, if a defendant does not know of a plaintiffs political affiliation (or lack thereof), he cannot be held liable for violating that plaintiffs First Amendment rights for basing an employment decision upon the plaintiffs political affiliation.”
  
   Winkelman,
  
  173 F.Supp.2d at 825;
  
   see Cusson-Cobb v. O’Lessker,
  
  953 F.2d 1079, 1080 (7th Cir.1992) (holding that, because the defendant did not know that the plaintiff was a Republican, he could not have fired her because she was a Republican and, thus, the plaintiff failed to establish that her political affiliation was a motivating factor in her discharge);
  
   see also Wilkie,
  
  2002 WL 338401 at *5 (noting that “[ejssential to such a showing is evidence that the defendants knew of the plaintiffs political association or activities; a defendant cannot base a decision on information he does not know.”).
 

  Here, Coffey has failed to tender any evidence of a nexus between politics and his failure to be hired as a stationary engineer. The undisputed facts reveal that no candidate was ever asked about politics, political support, or political affiliations during his interview. In addition, neither Galassi nor Simmons knew of Coffey, Short, or Jankauski’s political beliefs, affiliations, or associations. Likewise, although Warden Cox knew that Short had held an office in the Logan County Republican Party, he did not otherwise know of his political persuasion. Finally, although Stang recalled receiving some political recommendations
  
   9
  
  on behalf of some of the
   
   *1005
   
  candidates, he did not inform Galassi, Simmons, or Warden Cox of those recommendations, and he did not otherwise know of Coffey, Short, or Jankauski’s political leanings.
  
   10
  


  Furthermore, the manner in which the interviews occurred and the positions were awarded does not raise a reasonable inference that the positions were awarded based upon political considerations. “[T]he First Amendment does not require IDOC to follow any particular set of personnel procedures in awarding employment positions.”
  
   Winkelman,
  
  173 F.Supp.2d at 826,
  
   citing Rutan,
  
  497 U.S. at 80-81, 110 S.Ct. 2729 (Stevens, J., concurring) and
  
   Bishop v. Wood,
  
  426 U.S. 341, 349-50, 96 S.Ct. 2074, 48 L.Ed.2d 684 (1976). Moreover, Coffey has offered no evidence that the time honored tradition of promoting the most senior boil washer to fill a vacant stationary engineer position was an official policy or procedure of IDOC or the Logan Correctional Center.
  
   Id.
  
  Accordingly, the Court finds that Coffey has failed to establish a
  
   prima facie
  
  case that Defendants’ decision not to hire him for one of the vacant stationary engineer positions at the Logan Correction Center was politically motivated, and thus, Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on his claim.
 

  However, even if the Court were to find that Coffey’s “circumstantial evidence” satisfied his
  
   prima facie
  
  case, Defendants would, nevertheless, be entitled to summary judgment. As the Court noted
  
   supra,
  
  if a plaintiff satisfies his
  
   prima facie
  
  case, the burden shifts to the defendant to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he had a legitimate, nonpolitical reason for the employment decision.
  
   Nelms,
  
  153 F.3d at 818;
  
   Garrett,
  
  961 F.2d at 632.
 

  Here, Defendants have offered un-rebut-ted evidence that each applicant for the vacant stationary engineer positions were asked an identical set of questions from a pre-existing interview questionnaire relating to the candidates’ experience and qualifications for the position. The scoring results of the interviews ranked the candidates as follows: (1) Short; (2) Jankauski; (3) Hurley; and tied for (4) Fleshman and Coffey. Thus, Defendants have established by a preponderance of the evidence that, even if Short had not received one of the positions, Coffey would still not have been offered the job because Hurley ranked higher than he did.
  
   See Tarpley,
  
  96 F.3d at 929 (holding that “[e]ven if the interview process was biased in Blessing’s favor, four other applicants for the position received higher scores than Tarpley’s and, thus, would presumably have been preferred to Tarpley, even if Blessing had not been in the running for the position. Tarpley has provided us with no information about these candidates which could support a jury finding that their scores were unjustified by their qualifications or that they were favored over Tarpley for political reasons.”)(footnotes omitted).
 

  In addition, even if the Court were to accept the fact that the seniority
   
   *1006
   
  system
  
   (ie.,
  
  the most senior boil washer moving up to fill any vacant stationary engineer positions) should have been followed by Defendants in filling the stationary engineer positions, Coffey would still not have been awarded one of the positions. In his response to Defendants’ motion for summary judgment, Coffey admits that, under the “old system,” Jankauski would have received one of the vacant positions. However, Coffey also admits that Hurley was the second most senior boil washer. Thus, even under the hiring system cited by Coffey, he would not have been awarded one of the jobs.
  
   11
  

   Id.
  
  Accordingly, the Court finds that Defendants are entitled to summary judgment because they have satisfied their burden under
  
   Mt. Healthy.
  


    12
   




   Ergo,
  
  Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment is ALLOWED. Accordingly, summary judgment is hereby entered in favor of Defendants and against Plaintiff.
 


   1
  

   . At that time, Stang worked in the Office of the Director of IDOC.
  


   2
  

   . None of Defendants in this case were involved in the interview process for the vacant stationary engineer positions which were conducted in early 1999.
  


   3
  

   . In his response to Defendants’ motion for summary judgment, Coffey has failed to respond to paragraphs 10, 14, 15, and 23 of Defendants' statement of undisputed facts. As such, the Court will deem the facts contained within those paragraphs to have been admitted by Coffey.
   
    See
   
   CDIL-LR 7.1(D)(2)(providing that ''[a] failure to respond shall be deemed an admission of the motion.”);
   
    see also Waldridge v. American Hoechst Corp.,
   
   24 F.3d 918, 923 (7th Cir.1994)(holding that ""there is nothing improper in the court enforcing the rule strictly
   
    see also Little v. Cox's Supermarkets,
   
   71 F.3d 637, 641(7th Cir.1995) (noting that “[tjhis court has repeatedly recognized the importance and usefulness of this and similar local rules throughout the circuit, as well as ‘the exacting obligation these rules impose on a party contesting summaiy judgment.’ ”);
   
    see also O’Regan v. Arbitration Forums, Inc.,
   
   246 F.3d 975, 987 (7th Cir.2001)(holding ""that the district court did not abuse its discretion because Rules 12(M) and (N) apply to statements of material facts, and O’Regan has not identified for this court any specific facts contained in her 220-paragraph response that are material to her case. By not identifying any material facts to this court that would have required the denial of summary judgment, any claimed error in the denial of the motion to strike is harmless....""). While Coffey is correct that, in ruling upon Defendants' motion for summaiy judgment, the Court must view the record as a whole and must draw all reasonable inferences in his
    
    *1000
    
   favor, it is his responsibility to point the Court to where exactly in the record a genuine issue of material fact exists which would preclude the Court from entering summary judgment.

   975 F.2d 366, 369 (7th Cir.1992)(finding that ""an official-capacity suit against a state official is deemed to be a suit against the state and is thus barred by the Eleventh Amendment, absent a waiver by the state or a congressional override.""). To the extent that Coffey seeks an injunction or declaratory judgment awarding him the position of stationary engineer, his official capacity claim fails for the same reason that his individual capacity claim fails.

  OPINION
 


   Per Curiam:
  


  The district court awarded respondent a judgment against appellant based on an oral employment contract between the parties. Appellant contends we must reverse because the district court erred by finding (1) there was a binding contract, and (2) there was no accord and satisfaction of appellant’s obligations.
 

  1. We reject appellant’s contention that it cannot be bound by its employment contract because the contract was not reduced to a written agreement and signed by the parties.
   
   *601
   
  “ ‘Where a complete contract was made orally, the fact that it was expected that a written contract would afterwards be signed, embodying the terms of the oral contract, does not prevent the oral contract from taking effect.’ ” Micheletti v. Fugitt, 61 Nev. 478, 489, 134 P.2d 99, 104 (1943). Accord: Thompson v. Schurman, 150 P.2d 509 (Cal.App. 1944). Here, the district court found the parties orally agreed to a complete contract with the mutual intention that it would become binding immediately, even though it was contemplated that a formal written agreement was thereafter to be prepared and signed. This finding is supported by substantial evidence; therefore, it will not be disturbed on appeal. Alves v. Bumguardner, 91 Nev. 799, 544 P.2d 436 (1975); County of Clark v. Lucas, 91 Nev. 263, 534 P.2d 499 (1975).
 

  2. We also reject appellant’s contention that an accord and satisfaction discharged all its obligations to respondent. To establish an accord and satisfaction, it must be clearly shown that “. . . there was a meeting of the minds of the parties, accompanied by a sufficient consideration.” Walden v. Backus, 81 Nev. 634, 637, 408 P.2d 712, 713-14 (1965). See also, Adelman v. Arthur, 83 Nev. 436, 433 P.2d 841 (1967); and, Wolf v. Humboldt County, 36 Nev. 26, 131 P. 964 (1913). Here, the district court found there was no meeting of the minds or adequate consideration. This finding is also supported by substantial evidence and will not be disturbed on appeal. Alves v. Bumguardner, cited above; County of Clark v. Lucas, cited above.
 

  Collateral issues raised by appellant are without merit.
 

  Respondent is allowed interest on the judgment, and costs. NRAP 37; NRAP 39(a). His request for an attorney’s fee, under NRAP 39, is denied.

                  Plaintiff Rodney Belle, Sr., proceeding pro se and purporting to proceed as a

“private attorney general,” filed the complaint in this case on April 19, 2010. He names as

defendants fifty-five individuals and entities, as well as one thousand “John and Jane Does” and,

as a group, the “Temecula/Riverside/San Diego Superior Court/Nevada Township Court &

Commissioners & Presiding Judges.” Complaint (“Compl.”) at 1-6. Among the named

defendants are variety of alleged employees of the Superior Court of California, numerous

employees of the Riverside County “Sheriff Department,” the City of San Diego, and assorted

banks and other financial institutions. Id.

                  The substance of Mr. Belle’s complaint is, frankly, incomprehensible, consisting

of long strings of legal terms strung together without apparent logic and without connection to

specific factual allegations directed at specific defendants. The following passage is

characteristic:

               Guaranteed Rules of the Common Law by the 7th Amendment of
               the Constitutions for united States of America.

Compl. at 11. Mr. Belle’s complaint is also accompanied by numerous exhibits, including a copy

of a very similar complaint filed in the United States District Court for the Central District of

California. See id., Ex. A. That complaint was dismissed as frivolous on November 24, 2009.

See Belle v. Deutsche Bank Trust Co., Civil Action No. 09-2563, 2009 WL 4253101 (C.D. Cal.

Nov. 24, 2009).

               Since the filing of his complaint in this Court, Mr. Belle has never filed an

affidavit of service, as is required by Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. He has,

however, filed a string a documents, each entitled a “notice of joinder” and purporting to

consolidate this action with what appear to be judicial proceedings in state court. See, e.g.,

Notice of Joinder, Docket No. 2, at 6. Only one set of defendants, consisting of Catherine Cortez

Masto, Patrick Ferguson, Ted Pribnow, Brett Allen, John Munoz, Diane Comeaux, Fernando

Serrano, and Mike Willdon (“the moving defendants”), has responded to the plaintiff’s


                                                  2
complaint; they have moved to dismiss the claims against them. See State of Nevada

Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff’s Complaint at 1. The Court advised Mr. Belle by

Order dated June 4, 2010, that the motion would be granted as conceded if he failed to oppose it

as required by Local Civil Rule 7(b). Since Mr. Belle nevertheless failed to respond, the motion

will be granted as conceded, and all claims against the moving defendants will be dismissed.

               The Court is also empowered to dismiss claims sua sponte pursuant to Rule

12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure where a plaintiff’s claims are such that “the

plaintiff cannot possibly win relief.” Boritz v. United States, 685 F. Supp. 2d 113, 126 (D.D.C.

2010) (quoting Best v. Kelly, 39 F.3d 328, 331 (D.C. Cir. 1994)) (internal quotation marks

omitted). Such is the case here. Even when construing the complaint as liberally as possible, the

Court is unable to extract from the complaint any coherent claims against any of the defendants.

Consequently, the complaint will be dismissed. An Order consistent with this Memorandum

Opinion shall issue this same day.

               SO ORDERED.

3617487,3634065,3506190,Karlin v. Karlin,Elizabeth Karlin v. Abbott A. Karlin,"The plaintiff wife sued her husband for a divorce. An interlocutory judgment entered in her favor November 3, 1924, directed him to pay to her $15 per week for the support of herself and their child. In January, 1925, the parties entered into a written agreement whereby the wife accepted $1,000 ""in lieu of her alimony"" and the husband undertook to pay to her $6 per week for the support of the child. Thereafter and on February 4, 1925, the interlocutory judgment of divorce became a final judgment in accordance with a provision made therein for that eventuality.
This judgment having remained meantime unmodified, the wife, in December, 1936, brought suit thereon against the husband in the State of New Jersey. In the interim *Page 35 
from February, 1925, he had paid to her only $6 per week in reliance upon their agreement of January, 1925. By the New Jersey action, she sought recovery of the difference between the aggregate of those payments and the total sum to which she was entitled on the face of the judgment — a difference fixed by her at $5,590.
Confronted by that litigation in New Jersey, the husband moved in this action for an order amending the support provisions of the judgment so as to conform them nunc pro tunc to the agreement made by the parties in January, 1925. This relief was granted by the Special Term as of February 4, 1925, the date when the judgment became final. On appeal by the wife to the Appellate Division, the order was modified by denying so much of the motion as sought relief nunc pro tunc. This is an appeal as of right by the husband from that modification of the final judgment of divorce. (See Powers v. Powers, 214 N.Y. 660.)
The order of modification is silent as to whether it was made on the law or on the facts. The cases cited by the Appellate Division in its memorandum opinion (Livingston v. Livingston,173 N.Y. 377, and Krauss v. Krauss, 127 App. Div. 740) suggest that the order of the Special Term was modified on the law alone and counsel for the wife takes that position. He contends that the Special Term was wholly without power to amend (for the future or for the past) the support provisions of the judgment, since that power was not thereby reserved.
To this contention of complete absence of jurisdiction, the plain answer is that, when the judgment of divorce was entered in 1924, section 1170 of the Civil Practice Act provided as follows: ""Where an action for divorce * * * is brought by either husband or wife, the court * * * must give, either in the final judgment * * * or * * * before final judgment, such directions as justice requires, between the parties, for the custody, care, education, and maintenance of any of the children of the marriage, and where the action is brought by the wife, for the support of the plaintiff. The court, by order, upon the application of either party to the action, * * * after due notice to *Page 36 
the other, * * * at any time after final judgment, may annul, vary or modify such directions. * * *""
By force of this statutory continuation of jurisdiction, the Special Term here had power in its discretion to annul or modify the directions given by this final judgment for the support of the wife. ""The effect of the statute is to write a reservation into every final judgment of divorce. The jurisdiction of the court over the parties and over the incidental subject-matter is prolonged; and to that extent the action may be said to be pending within the meaning and intent of section 1169 of the Civil Practice Act."" (Fox v. Fox, 263 N.Y. 68, 70.) It follows, we think, that the Special Term was warranted in its amendment of the judgment nunc pro tunc as of the date it became final, so as to square it with what was then the obligation of the husband under the agreement made by the parties in January, 1925. (See Galusha v. Galusha, 116 N.Y. 635.)Livingston v. Livingston (ubi supra) holds nothing to the contrary. The judgment in that case was entered before the enactment of the statute we have quoted. Cary v. Cary
(168 App. Div. 939; 217 N.Y. 670), a case decided on the authority ofKrauss v. Krauss (ubi supra), was overruled by Kirkbride
v. Van Note (275 N.Y. 244).
The Special Term clearly did not abuse the discretion which we hold was thus committed to the court by the statute. In a word, the order of the Special Term was not unauthorized as matter of law.
If, on the other hand, the case is that the Appellate Division held on the facts that the Special Term erroneously exercised its discretion, then we have jurisdiction to review the new findings which the order of modification implies. (Matter of Flagler,248 N.Y. 415.) In that case, we are disposed to think that the weight of the evidence was with the Special Term.
The order of the Appellate Division should be reversed and that of the Special Term affirmed, without costs.

Defendant assigns as error that the trial court denied his motion to quash the indictment. An indictment may be quashed for want of jurisdiction, irregularity in the selection of the jury, or for defect in the bill of indictment. 4 Strong, N. C. Index 2d, Indictment and Warrant, § 14, p. 359. But an asserted variance between the allegations of the indictment and the proof is properly raised by motion for nonsuit. State v. McDowell, 1 N. C. App. 361, 161 S.E. 2d 769.
*135We have carefully examined the bill of indictment, and although it is not a model to be followed, it adequately charges defendant with felonious breaking and entering, jurisdiction is apparent, and there is no contention of irregularity in selecting the jury.
Defendant undertakes to assign as error that defendant’s confession was admitted in evidence “where there was no evidence of a written waiver of the defendant’s constitutional rights and where there was no warning that the defendant could have an attorney present.” Defendant argues that G.S. 7A-457 specifically requires that a waiver of counsel must be in writing. The question of the requirements of G.S. 7A-457 is not presented by defendant’s assignment of error. The exception upon which the assignment of error is based is an exception to the failure of the trial judge to make findings of fact touching upon the voluntariness of defendant’s confession; this same exception is the basis for defendant’s further assignment of error which we consider below.
Defendant assigns as error that the trial court made no findings of fact with respect to the voluntariness of defendant’s confession. When defendant’s confession was offered in evidence, defendant objected, and the trial court very properly sent the jury out and conducted a preliminary inquiry to determine the voluntariness of the confession. Testimony was taken from two witnesses for the State and two witnesses for defendant, and the evidence was in conflict. The only ruling or finding by the trial court was as follows:
“Based upon the foregoing testimony elicted from the witness in the absence of the jury, the Court finds as a fact that the statement reduced to writing in the defendant’s handwriting on the nineteenth day of March, 1970, in the Mt. Holly Police Department, was freely, voluntarily, and understandingly made, without the inducement of any promise or threat and the Court further finds it a fact that the paperwriting identified by Officer Hinson and signed by the defendant after the same was read to him — that the information contained in this statement was freely, voluntarily and understandingly given, without threats or promises of any kind or nature and that the evidence obtained at the Mt. Holly Police Department is competent and admissible before the jury.”
*136From this ruling by the trial court it is impossible to determine upon what set of facts the conclusions of voluntariness are based. The evidence was such that varied fact situations could be found, depending upon the weight and credit given the testimony by the trial judge. Therefore we cannot tell whether the trial court’s conclusions are supported by the facts. The admission of defendant’s confession without factual findings from which we can determine whether legal error was committed by the trial court was erroneous and entitles defendant to a new trial. State v. Moore, 275 N.C. 141, 166 S.E. 2d 53; State v. Conyers, 267 N.C. 618, 148 S.E. 2d 569.
Defendant’s remaining assignments of error are not discussed because they are not likely to arise upon retrial.

MEMORANDUM AND ORDER
TRAGER, District Judge.
Plaintiff Abernathy-Thomas Engineering Co. (""Abernathy"") brought this action against defendant Pall Corporation and several of its subsidiaries (collectively, ""Pall"") alleging fraud, misuse of proprietary information, unfair competition, tortious interference with contract, breach of fiduciary duty, and a debt owed on a commission contract, all in connection with Pall's termination of an exclusive distribution agreement with Abernathy. In response, Pall asserted counterclaims against Abernathy for a debt owed and for breach of contract. After conducting discovery, Pall moved for summary judgment on all claims, and Abernathy moved for partial summary judgment on its commission contract claim and on Pall's counterclaims.

Background
The facts of this case, viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party with respect to each claim, see Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 255, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 2513, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986); Ward v. Thomas, 207 F.3d 114, 119 (2d Cir.2000), are as follows.

(1)
Pall is a large, publicly-held company that sells industrial filters. (Ellis Decl. of *587 9/9/99, Ã Â¸ÂÃ Â¸Â 1-2 [hereinafter Ellis Decl. I].) Abernathy is a closely-held distributor of various industrial products, including filters. (Ellis Dep. at 9, 37.) From some time in the 1950s until March 12, 1993, Abernathy (and its predecessor, Equipment Sales Corporation) acted as the exclusive distributor of, and sales representative[1] for, Pall's filtration products in Tennessee, Kentucky, North Carolina, and South Carolina (the ""Territory""). (Ellis Decl. I, Ã Â¸Â 3; Festa Dep. at 43.) Prior to retaining Abernathy as its sales representative, Pall had little or no sales in this Territory. (Ellis Decl. I, Ã Â¸Â 5.) By 1993, sales of Pall products secured by Abernathy's efforts in the Territory had grown to approximately $5,000,000 annually and were generated by numerous customers, all of which had been developed by Abernathy over forty years. (Id. Ã Â¸Â 6.) In addition, Abernathy developed valuable information about these customers that has helped Pall to preserve and increase its sales in the Territory. (Id. Ã Â¸Â 7.) This information included the types of filters used by each customer, the filter layouts at each customer plant, customer purchase projections, and plant development plans. (Id.; Festa Dep. at 45.)

(2)
By the 1990s, sales of Pall products constituted the bulk of Abernathy's total sales, giving Pall considerable influence over Abernathy and allowing it to impose a number of obligations on Abernathy through its Exclusive Distribution Agreement[2] with Abernathy. (Ellis Decl. I, Ã Â¸Â 8.) Most pertinent to this action was a covenant under which
[t]he Distributor agree[d] to send the Company a monthly report of all shipments to customers of Products, indicating specific products, including quantity, in substantially the following manner:
Customer State, City Part Number Quantity Date Shipped
(Ortego Affirm., Ex. C, Ã Â¸Â IV(f)). The Exclusive Distribution Agreement does not contain a confidentiality clause in the distributor's favor, and at no point in their relationship did Pall indicate to Abernathy that the information collected under Section IV(f) would not be disclosed to anyone else. (Ellis Dep. at 104, 114-15; Prevatte Dep. at 24.) On the contrary, the Agreement provided:
The Company [Pall] may use such information as it sees fit to aid in the distribution, marketing, sales, promotion, or manufacture of its Products.
(Ortego Affirm., Ex. C, Ã Â¸Â IV(f)). Moreover, Abernathy's vice president Deryl Prevatte (""Prevatte"") could not recall any occasion on which Abernathy sought to modify the Agreement with a promise of confidentiality from Pall. (Prevatte Dep. at 48.)
Nonetheless, Abernathy assumed that the customer information supplied to Pall would be kept in confidence. (Ellis Dep. at 114 (""We had no reason to doubt that they would do otherwise."").) In this regard, it is should be noted that Pall's former senior vice-president Robert J. Festa (""Festa"") conceded in deposition that the relationship between Pall and its distributors was a ""close"" one, akin to a ""partnership,"" and that it involved an ""element of trust."" (Festa Dep. at 53-54.)
*588 Accordingly, pursuant to Section IV(f) of the Agreement, Abernathy sent Pall copies of every invoice for every Pall product it sold, which Pall then entered into a computer database. (Prevatte Dep. at 27; Festa Dep. at 47-48.) Each invoice indicated the customer's name and address, and the quantity and part number(s) sold. (Id.) Prevatte stated that Pall began requiring Abernathy to supply this information in the 1980s, or maybe even as far back as the 1970s. (Prevatte Dep. at 30.)
Over the years, Pall gained further familiarity with Abernathy's customers by occasionally sending its own employees to accompany Abernathy sales representatives on visits to Abernathy's customers. (Prevatte Dep. at 30; Festa Dep. at 43-45.) In addition, acting on the information obtained from Abernathy, Pall employees would from time to time directly contact Abernathy's customers by telephone, beginning sometime before 1990. (Ellis Dep. at 148-49; Prevatte Dep. at 32; Festa Dep. at 44.) Such direct contacts with Abernathy's customers were expressly authorized by the Exclusive Distribution Agreement, provided that Pall paid the distributor the appropriate commission on such sales:
The Company shall have the right to make direct sales of Products to customers in the Markets in the Territory. In the event that the Company makes any direct sales of Products to customers in the Markets, located in the Territory, the Company shall pay to the Distributor a commission on such sales according to the commission schedule....
(Ortego Affirm., Ex. C, Ã Â¸Â VII(a).)
The final covenant relevant to this action was a best efforts clause that imposed certain manpower and training obligations on Abernathy:
The Distributor agrees to use its best efforts to distribute, market, sell and promote the Products in the Territory, which shall be the Distributor's primary responsibility.... The Distributor ... agrees to acquire, develop, train and sustain sufficient sales and service personnel to distribute, market, sell and promote the Products. The Distributor will enroll all new sales personnel in a Pall training program as soon after being hired as the Company deems necessary.
(Id., Ã Â¸Â IV(a).)

(3)
Although the relationship between the two companies would appear to have been a satisfactory one for many years given its longevity, throughout the period from 1990 to 1993 Pall began to express dissatisfaction with Abernathy's performance in various respects. (Ellis Dep. at 60-64; Prevatte Dep. at 36.) Specifically, ""[m]any people, various people"" at Pall complained that Abernathy was not meeting the annual sales goals that Pall had set for Abernathy as part of the ""Sales Action Plans"" (""SAPs"") developed by Abernathy and Pall each June or July. (Ellis Dep. at 61-63; see also Ellis Dep. at 16-17; Prevatte Dep. at 16-18; Festa Dep. at 20-22.)[3] Pall also complained about the knowledge and training of Abernathy's sales representatives. (Ellis Dep. at 62.) Finally, a recurring complaint voiced by Pall even before 1990 was that Abernathy did not have a sufficiently large sales force in place to market Pall's products effectively. (Ellis Dep. at *589 63-64, 126, 226; Prevatte Dep. at 20, 22-23; see also Prevatte Dep. at 85, 87.)

(4)
Until 1992, Abernathy Ã Â¹Â and all of Pall's other distributors Ã Â¹Â distributed Pall's products pursuant to exclusive distribution agreements and sales representative agreements that were terminable without cause by either party on thirty days notice. (Ortego Affirm., Ex. C, Ã Â¸Â VIII(a); id., Ex. D, Ã Â¸Â VI(a).) Such thirty-day distributorship contracts are standard in the industrial products sector. (Ellis Dep. at 13-14, 46-47; Prevatte Dep. at 11-14.)
However, in November 1991, at an annual meeting with its various sales representatives and distributors, Pall hinted that it was considering granting some of its distributors longer term contracts. The theme for the meeting that year was ""Renew in '92."" At the Renew in '92 meeting, Pall's then-president and CEO, Maurice G. Hardy (""Hardy""), outlined various qualities that Pall was looking for in a distributor:
1) The distributor should be proficient at selling high value-added, leading edge technological products, and have an organization capable of partnering with the customer in order to satisfy the customers' needs for quality, of both product and service, and on-time delivery.
2) The distributor partner should be highly profitable and in so being, be able to sustain itself in business for an unlimited future period also, and provide the entrepreneurial management structure to ensure this.
(Ortego Affirm., Ex. H, at 8.) Hardy then intimated: ""Providing that our distributor partner meets the criteria that I mentioned previously, Pall Corporation's management will have no problem Ã Â¹Â based on performance clauses being met Ã Â¹Â negotiating a long-term commitment with its distribution partners."" (Id. at 9.)
Hardy, who had formerly been the head of Pall's distribution operation in Europe, had experienced success with the introduction of long-term contracts in Europe and felt that a similar practice would benefit sales in the United States. (Festa Dep. at 76; Rapone Dep. at 61.) However, at no point during the Renew in '92 meeting (or at any other time) did Hardy or any other Pall official expressly offer Abernathy a long-term contract or discuss the matter with any Abernathy officials personally. (Ellis Dep. at 75, 77, 88-91, 94.)
As a follow-up to Hardy's remarks on the possibility of negotiating long-term distribution contracts, Pall senior vice president Festa sent a memorandum to Abernathy and other distributors on January 27, 1992 (the ""Festa Memo""), in which he noted that Hardy had ""expressed his conviction that those distributors who establish a track record of meeting our requirements may be offered a two year contract."" (Ortego Affirm., Ex. I, at 1.) In the memorandum, Festa explained that he was writing ""to outline some of the criteria we will be using to determine who will be offered the extended term contract."" (Id.) Festa then provided a list of factors that ""at a minimum"" would be considered before an award of a two-year contract would be made:
1) The distributor must provide for appropriate levels of manpower, training, and selling time. They must also hire Pall Product Managers, when requested by Pall Corporation. They must maintain a stable field sales organization.
2) The [Sales Action Plan] development and execution must be diligently pursued in a sincere effort to meet the sales targets arrived at in our joint SAP meetings.
3) The distributor must work with Pall in the implementation of a Quality Partnership between our companies. They must also pursue, with Pall's help, ISO 9002 (stocklist) Certification.[4]

*590 4) The distributor must maintain satisfactory levels of inventory, and report stock sales and inventory levels to Pall Corporation in a timely and complete manner.
5) The distributor must participate in our EDI network for order entry, as soon as it is in place.
6) The distributor will promptly follow up on all qualified leads provided by Pall Corporation, and report results in a timely manner.
7) The distributor will also be rated on other more subjective but equally important factors, including but not limited to, establishing a proper succession plan, preparing and sharing with us their yearly business plans, maintaining a willingness to commit resources to new market areas identified by Pall, and in general maintaining an attitude of loyalty towards, and a willingness to be a partner with Pall Corporation.
(Id. at 1-2.) Festa added that Pall expected to meet ""over the next few months"" with those distributors who qualified for the two-year contract. (Id. at 2.)

(5)
Abernathy claims that it took various actions over the course of 1992 to meet the enumerated criteria. (Ellis Decl. I, Ã Â¸Â 12.) Since the late 1980s, Pall had been requesting that Abernathy hire or designate one of its employees, preferably one with technical expertise, to be a ""Pall Product Manager,"" that is, an employee dedicated exclusively to managing the distributor's sales efforts for Pall products. (Prevatte Dep. at 87; Festa Dep. at 57.) At some point after Renew in '92, Abernathy finally responded to Pall's request by appointing Roger Ellis, the son of Abernathy's then-president Jim Ellis (""Ellis""), as its Pall Product Manager.[5] (Ellis Decl. I, Ã Â¸Â 10; Prevatte Dep. at 87-89; Festa Dep. at 57-58.) In addition, Abernathy Ã Â¹Â which already had four of its employees enrolled in ISO 9002 training courses at its own expense before Renew in '92 Ã Â¹Â switched its employees to an ISO 9002 training course that Pall was to give in February of 1993 at a discounted rate. (Ellis Dep. at 78, 184-85, 193; Ortego Affirm., Ex. K, at 4; id., Ex. O, at 2.) Abernathy's management also reviewed whether Abernathy met the remaining requirements specified in the Festa Memo. (Ellis Dep. at 78.)[6]
Besides these steps, however, Abernathy did not change any clients or business relationships; nor did it alter the way in which it developed Pall sales or sold Pall products. (Ellis Dep. at 78-79; Prevatte *591 Dep. at 54.) Moreover, the individual most knowledgeable about Abernathy's finances, Jim Ellis, (Ellis Dep. at 198), could not recall whether Abernathy expended any other monies in reliance on Renew in '92 or the Festa memo, (id. at 79), though in a subsequent declaration, Ellis estimated that Abernathy's efforts to secure a long-term contract with Pall cost it $200,000, (Ellis Decl. I, Ã Â¸Â 21).[7]

(6)
Despite the designation of Roger Ellis as Pall Product Manager, Pall's disenchantment with Abernathy appears to have grown. At some point in the fall of 1992, Deryl Prevatte heard through ""the grapevine"" that Pall was in some way dissatisfied with Abernathy's performance. (Prevatte Dep. at 34-35.) As a result, during a dinner meeting in Long Island with Festa and Pall's senior vice president in charge of distribution, Vincent Rapone (""Rapone""), on or about September 23, 1992, Prevatte asked whether they had any dissatisfaction with Abernathy's performance. (Prevatte Dep. at 36; see also Ellis Dep. at 155.) According to Prevatte, neither Rapone nor Festa indicated that Pall had any problem with Abernathy. (Prevatte Dep. at 37; see also Ellis Dep. at 155.)[8] Nonetheless, Prevatte continued to hear ""rumors"" about Pall's dissatisfaction with Abernathy from salespeople who had spoken to Pall regional representatives. (Prevatte Dep. at 35.)
On October 13, 1992, Abernathy's Jim Ellis called Rapone to inquire about what Pall's concerns were, if any. (Ellis Dep. at 156.) After speaking with other members of Pall's management, including Festa, Rapone called Ellis back on October 16, 1992, and indicated that Pall had four concerns with Abernathy's performance: (1) that Abernathy's accounts payable were 42 days behind; (2) that Abernathy had not met the sales goals specified in its first quarter Sales Action Plan; (3) that Roger Ellis was not spending all of his time on the Pall account, despite the fact that Abernathy had designated him to be the Pall Product Manager; and (4) that Abernathy did not have enough sales. (Id. at 156-159.) At his deposition in this action, Ellis could not recall whether he followed up with anyone from Pall regarding any of these four items. (Id. at 159.)

(7)
Contemporaneously with these events, in 1992 Pall began to develop a new sales tracking program called ""SITES."" (Ellis Dep. at 105.) (The name appears to be an acronym, but neither of the parties has indicated what it stood for.) All of Pall's distributors were required to implement the new program. (Ellis Dep. at 107.) SITES was based on a computer program that allowed distributors to create a database of information on their customers. (See Pall Corp., SITES Database System: Technical Reference and Users' Guide 1-1 (n.d.), attached as exhibit to Letter from Defendant's Counsel to Chambers of 5/8/00 [hereinafter SITES Manual].) The SITES database was to contain much of the information that Pall had already obtained through customer invoices and direct contacts, *592 including the customers' names, addresses, contact people, and the number and types of filter housings and filter elements used at each location. (Ellis Dep. at 106-07, 109; Prevatte Dep. at 79; Festa Dep. at 172; Rapone Dep. at 38-39, 197; SITES Manual at 3-1, 4-4.) SITES, however, allowed the distributor and Pall to compile this information in a much more efficient and readily accessible form. (Ellis Dep. at 109-10; Festa Dep. at 172.)
In addition, each distributor's salespeople were to enter information on their customers' filter ""change-out"" dates into the SITES database. (Festa Dep. at 85-86; Rapone Dep. at 19-20, 39-40; SITES Manual at 4-4 to -8.) Industrial filters generally consist of a filter housing, which has a relatively long useful life, and a filter element, which has a much shorter useful life. (Festa Dep. at 86; Rapone Dep. at 26.) By keeping track of the dates on which a particular customer was likely to need a replacement filter element, Pall and its distributors could gain an advantage over competitors in the lucrative replacement filter market. (Festa Dep. at 131-32; Rapone Dep. at 19-20, 40.) One of the functions of the SITES program was to generate a report indicating which customers were approaching a change-out date for their filter elements. (SITES Manual at 1-1, 4-8, 6-1.) These reports allowed Pall's distributors to make anticipatory sales calls to those customers and thus beat their competitors to the sale. (Ellis Dep. at 110.) All of the information entered into each distributor's database, including customer change-out dates, was to be copied onto a computer disk and sent to Pall periodically. (Festa Dep. at 174; Ortego Affirm., Ex. E; SITES Manual at 7-1.)
Neither party's deposition witnesses could recall precisely when the SITES program was introduced. Abernathy's Jim Ellis testified only that it was begun sometime after Renew in '92, i.e., after November of 1991. (Ellis Dep. at 106.) As for Pall, Rapone testified that as of June 17, 1992 the SITES computer program had not been completed, (Rapone Dep. at 124), while Festa testified that it was operational by January 23, 1993, (Festa Dep. at 150-51). The documentary evidence produced to the court suggests that the SITES program was not implemented at Abernathy until January of 1993. Specifically, a letter from Abernathy to Pall dated June 4, 1992, indicates that, at that point, Pall had only just inquired as to the type of computer hardware used by its distributors. (Ortego Affirm., Ex. P.) Seven months later, on January 18, 1993, Abernathy signed an amendment to the Exclusive Distribution Agreement requiring Abernathy to participate in the SITES program (the ""SITES Amendment""). (Ortego Affirm., Ex. E.) Finally, in a letter to Pall dated January 21, 1993, Abernathy indicated it was ""moving along with [its] Sites Program"" and ""expect[ed] to start getting the[] reports back from the salesmen by the end of January."" (Id., Ex. O, at 2 (emphasis added).)

(8)
In the same January 21st letter, Abernathy's Ellis and Prevatte provided Pall's Festa with a monthly management report. (Id.) At the end of the letter, Ellis and Prevatte asked:
Bob, [Abernathy] is interested in a long term contract with Pall. How can we get a long term contract? What do we need to do and who do we need to contact to be considered for the long term contract?
(Id. at 2.) As far as Prevatte could recall, this letter was the first and only time that Abernathy had broached the subject of the long-term contract with Pall. (Prevatte Dep. at 60.)
Unbeknownst to Ellis and Prevatte, however, granting Abernathy a long-term contract was the farthest thing from the minds of Pall's management in January of 1993. According to Rapone, Pall's management had become increasingly dissatisfied with Abernathy's declining sales in the fall of 1992. (Rapone Dep. at 193-94.) *593 Finally, Festa and several Pall officials who reported to him determined to find out whether there was another viable distributor for Pall products in the Territory. (Festa Dep. at 78-80; Rapone Dep. at 58, 192-93.) Festa directed Rapone to begin searching for a replacement for Abernathy. (Rapone Dep. at 57.) Rapone interviewed two potential replacements during the last two weeks of January 1993. (Festa Dep. at 154; Rapone Dep. at 162-63.) In early February 1993, Pall's management determined that Fluid Flow of North Carolina, Inc. (""Fluid Flow"") could serve Pall's distribution needs in the Territory. (Festa Dep. at 80; Rapone Dep. at 195.) At that point, Pall's decision to terminate Abernathy became final. (Rapone Dep. at 195.) On February 11, 1993, Pall sent notice to Abernathy that it was terminating the distributorship agreements and that the termination would become effective in thirty days. (Ortego Affirm., Ex. Y.) Pall simultaneously appointed Fluid Flow to be its new exclusive distributor in the Territory. (Festa Dep. at 80.)[9]

(9)
Abernathy claims that after Pall terminated its distributorship, some of its industrial filter customers terminated blanket supply contracts they had with Abernathy. (Ellis Dep. at 272-73.) In deposition, Abernathy's Jim Ellis could only recall one such customer by name, DuPont, but stated that Abernathy had documents that would show that there were others. (Id. at 273-74.) Nonetheless, in papers submitted ten months later on the instant motions, Abernathy has still not named these additional lost customers.
Abernathy's asserted damages do not rest solely on having lost its supplier of filtration products, however.[10] Abernathy claims that it lost additional business as a result of unfair competition from Pall and its new distributor in the Territory, Fluid Flow. Specifically, Abernathy claims that Pall gave Fluid Flow the customer information that Abernathy had compiled for Pall over the course of their forty-year relationship. (Ellis Dep. at 115-17.) As evidence that Pall had, through Fluid Flow, used this customer information to Abernathy's disadvantage, Ellis testified in deposition that:
[I]mmediately after ... Fluid Flow was appointed, a few of our customers told us that they got flyers from Fluid Flow telling them they were the new distributor for Pall.
And at least one of those gave me a copy of the announcement that he received from Fluid Flow.
And in this particular case, the individual said that he had been called by Fluid Flow.
....
... [I]mmediately they were calling on the key individual that buys filters and so forth.
And to my knowledge, Fluid Flow did not have at least this type of filter prior to taking on the Pall line and had no reason to call any [of the] individuals [who] told us that they had not been called on by Fluid Flow prior to this.
(Id. at 115-17; see also Prevatte Dep. at 45-46.) Ellis estimates that it would have taken Fluid Flow two years to compile this *594 information by its own efforts. (Ellis Decl. I, Ã Â¸Â 19.)
Abernathy alleges that as a result of the termination of the distributorship and competition from Fluid Flow, it was able to replace only a small amount of its Pall business and had to lay off five or six employees in the year or so after the termination. (Ellis Dep. at 112, 118, 214-217.)[11]
A final claimed consequence of the termination was that another manufacturer with which Abernathy had a distributorship agreement, a company called Thermon, terminated its contract with Abernathy out of fear that without the Pall contract, Abernathy would not be able to maintain a large enough sales force to service its distribution needs. (Ellis Decl. I, Ã Â¸Â 16.)
At the time of his deposition, Jim Ellis was unable to quantify how much Abernathy lost in profits because of the termination and its aftermath, (Ellis Dep. at 96, 111), though in a subsequent declaration Ellis estimated Abernathy's total lost profits at $250,000 per annum, (Ellis Decl. I, Ã Â¸Â 21).

(10)
The final issue raised in this action concerns an alleged unwritten incidental commission agreement relating to certain filters used in nuclear power plants. (Reply Ã Â¸ÂÃ Â¸Â 15-16; Ellis Dep. at 121-22, 281-85.) Abernathy claims that pursuant to this agreement, Pall required it to store an excess inventory of nuclear filters during the late 1980s. (Ellis Dep. at 282-83.) Pertinently, Pall accounted for nuclear filters sent to its distributors as sales as soon as they were shipped to the distributor. (Festa Dep. at 95.) Abernathy's Ellis alleges that Pall used this storage arrangement and accounting convention to artificially inflate the sales figures reported in its annual financial statements. (Ellis Dep. at 282-83.) Later, when a customer actually ordered the nuclear filters, Abernathy would send the invoiced filters back to Pall, which would then ship them to the customer. (Id. at 121-22.) In return for facilitating this scheme, Pall allegedly promised to pay Abernathy an extra five percent commission, in addition to the regular commission specified in the Agreement. (Id. at 281, 283.) Abernathy further charges that this practice was in violation of regulations promulgated by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (""NRC"") which require that certain filters used in nuclear reactors be shipped directly from the manufacturer to the customer in order to ensure that the filters have not deteriorated on the shelf. (Id. at 121-22; see also Festa Dep. at 87-88 (stating that NRC ""regulations require that [this type of filter] come directly from the manufacturer of the product"").)[12]
In its motion papers, Pall denies that it had any such side agreement with Abernathy. (Def.'s Mem. Opp'n Pl.'s Mot. Summ. J. & Supp. Def.'s Cross-Mot. Summ. J. at 3-4 [hereinafter Def.'s Mem. Opp'n].) In deposition, however, Pall's Festa conceded the existence of an arrangement whereby Pall stored nuclear filters at Abernathy's facilities and then required Abernathy to the ship the filters back to Pall for inspection before shipping them to the customer. (Festa Dep. at 87-89, 92-95.) Moreover, although Festa could not recall whether Pall had promised to pay Abernathy an extra commission for storing the nuclear filters, he testified that it was ""possible."" (Id. at 161.)
Festa stated that the purpose of the arrangement was to ensure that nuclear filters could be sent out to its customers as *595 quickly as possible. (Id. at 94.) In light of Festa's admission that Pall had sufficient warehouse space to store the filters at its own facilities, (id. at 94), this explanation makes no sense. Obviously, Pall's arrangement increased the amount of time required to get the filters to customers by the amount of time that it took for the distributor to ship the filters back to Pall.
At any rate, shortly after the termination, Abernathy contacted Pall, requesting payment of special nuclear filter commissions that were allegedly owed but unpaid as of the date of termination. (Ellis Decl. of 8/9/99 [hereinafter Ellis Decl. II], Ex. 11, Memo from Ellis to Rapone of 4/8/93.) A volley of correspondence followed, (id., Exs. 9-11), and on April 19, 1993, Pall took the position that it owed Abernathy no more than $4,745.56 on the account, (id., Ex. 10). Abernathy disputes this figure and now seeks $62,867.00, which it claims Pall still owes it. (Id. Ã Â¸Â 21.)

Discussion
In its First Amended Complaint, plaintiff pled five causes of action: (1) fraud, (2) misuse of proprietary information, (3) unfair competition, (4) tortious interference with contract, and (5) breach of fiduciary duty. In its Answer, defendant interposed counterclaims for a debt owed and for breach of contract. Finally, in its Reply to defendant's Answer to its Amended Complaint, plaintiff makes a claim for special commissions due on the storage of certain nuclear filters. Defendant moves for summary judgment on all claims, and plaintiff cross-moves for partial summary judgment on its nuclear filter commissions claim and defendant's counter-claims. Each claim is discussed below, with the misuse of proprietary information and unfair competition claim analyzed together.

(1)
Abernathy's cause of action for fraud encompasses two distinct claims. First, Abernathy alleges that, contrary to Pall's representations at Renew in '92 and in the Festa Memo, Pall never intended to offer Abernathy a long-term contract even if Abernathy met the stated conditions. Second, Abernathy asserts that Pall had made the decision to terminate Abernathy in or before July of 1992 but fraudulently concealed this fact from Abernathy. Abernathy charges that in both instances Pall's fraudulent misrepresentations and omissions were motivated by a desire to extract additional customer information from Abernathy before terminating Abernathy's distributorship. Pall moves for summary judgment on both claims, which are discussed separately below.

a. Applicable Law
As an initial matter in this diversity action, the governing law must be determined. Because both parties have relied exclusively on New York law in their briefs, they have tacitly consented to the application of New York law, and no further conflict of laws analysis need be conducted. See 3Com Corp. v. Banco do Brasil, S.A., 171 F.3d 739, 743 (2d Cir.1999). Accordingly, New York law will be applied to all claims herein. See id.
To prove common law fraud under New York law, a plaintiff must show that: (1) the defendant made a material false representation; (2) the defendant intended to defraud the plaintiff thereby; (3) the plaintiff reasonably relied upon the representation; and (4) the plaintiff suffered damage as a result of such reliance. See Independent Order of Foresters v. Donald, Lufkin & Jenrette, Inc., 157 F.3d 933, 940 (2d Cir.1998); Banque Arabe et Internationale D'Investissement v. Maryland Nat'l Bank, 57 F.3d 146, 153 (2d Cir.1995). Under New York law, each element of a fraud claim must be shown by clear and convincing evidence. See Gaidon v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., 94 N.Y.2d 330, 349-50, 704 N.Y.S.2d 177, 186, 725 N.E.2d 598 (1999); Vermeer Owners, Inc. v. Guterman, 78 N.Y.2d 1114, 1116, 578 N.Y.S.2d 128, 129, 585 N.E.2d 377 (1991); Banque Arabe, 57 F.3d at 153. *596 Clear and convincing evidence is evidence that makes the fact to be proved ""highly probable."" 1A New York Pattern Jury Instructions Ã Â¹Â Civil Ã Â¸Â 1:64 (3d ed.1999). Accordingly, Pall's motion for summary judgment must be granted if Abernathy has not produced evidence on which a reasonable jury could find that Abernathy has proven each element of its fraud claim by ""clear and convincing evidence"" as defined by New York law. See Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. at 255-56, 106 S. Ct. at 2514.
To establish fraudulent concealment under New York law, a plaintiff must prove that: (1) the defendant failed to disclose material information that it had a duty to disclose; (2) the defendant intended to defraud the plaintiff thereby; (3) the plaintiff reasonably relied upon the omission; and (4) the plaintiff suffered damage as a result of such reliance. See Bermuda Container Line Ltd. v. International Longshoremen's Ass'n, AFL-CIO, 192 F.3d 250, 258 (2d Cir.1999) (citing Nasaba Corp. v. Harfred Realty Corp., 287 N.Y. 290, 295, 39 N.E.2d 243, 245 (1942)); Banque Arabe, 57 F.3d at 153. As with fraudulent misrepresentation claims, the plaintiff must prove each element of fraudulent concealment by clear and convincing evidence. See Kuo Feng Corp. v. Ma, 248 A.D.2d 168, 168-69, 669 N.Y.S.2d 575, 576 (1st Dep't 1998); Board of Educ. v. Sargent, Webster, Crenshaw & Folley, 146 A.D.2d 190, 199, 539 N.Y.S.2d 814, 820 (3d Dep't 1989); Chase Manhattan Bank, N.A. v. T & N PLC, 1998 WL 634218, at *2, 162 F.3d 1147 (2d Cir.1998) (Table); Banque Arabe, 57 F.3d at 153.

b. Renew in '92 and the Long Term Contract
Abernathy's fraud claim based on the promise of a long-term contract at Renew in '92 and in the Festa Memo must be dismissed because Abernathy has not produced evidence upon which a reasonable jury could find by clear and convincing evidence that the promise to negotiate a long-term contract with distributors who met its requirements was false when made. Where a cause of action for fraud is based on a defendant's statement of future intention, in order to prove the element of misrepresentation, plaintiff must show that the defendant, at the time the promissory representation was made, never intended to honor or act on his statement. See Boylan v. G.L. Morrow Co., 63 N.Y.2d 616, 619, 479 N.Y.S.2d 499, 500, 468 N.E.2d 681 (1984); Lanzi v. Brooks, 43 N.Y.2d 778, 779-80, 402 N.Y.S.2d 384, 384, 373 N.E.2d 278 (1977); G & F Assocs. Co. v. Brookhaven Beach Health Related Facility, 249 A.D.2d 441, 443, 671 N.Y.S.2d 510, 511-12 (2d Dep't 1998); Non-Linear Trading Co. v. Braddis Assocs., Inc., 243 A.D.2d 107, 118, 675 N.Y.S.2d 5, 13 (1st Dep't 1998). The mere fact that Abernathy was not given a long-term contract is, as a matter of law, insufficient to establish that Pall fraudulently misrepresented its intentions. See Getty Petroleum Corp. v. DeIorio, 194 A.D.2d 762, 763, 599 N.Y.S.2d 829, 831 (2d Dep't 1993); Lanzi v. Brooks, 54 A.D.2d 1057, 1058, 388 N.Y.S.2d 946, 948 (3d Dep't 1976), aff'd, 43 N.Y.2d 778, 402 N.Y.S.2d 384, 373 N.E.2d 278 (1977); Brown v. Lockwood, 76 A.D.2d 721, 732-33, 432 N.Y.S.2d 186, 195 (2d Dep't 1980) (""Fraudulent intent not to perform a promise cannot be inferred merely from the fact of nonperformance....""). Plaintiff must produce additional evidence of a present fraudulent intent to carry its burden of proof. See Lockwood, 76 A.D.2d at 733, 432 N.Y.S.2d at 195.
In its motion papers, Abernathy strenuously argues that it met the conditions for the award of a long-term contract recited in the Festa Memo. (See, e.g., Pl.'s Mem. Opp'n I, at 4-6.) However, as just noted, the fact that a promissory representation is not fulfilled does not suffice to prove that the representation was fraudulent when made. Therefore, Abernathy's fraud claim can survive summary judgment only if it produces additional proof that Pall acted with an intent to deceive when it made the representations regarding *597 the long-term contract at Renew in '92 and in the Festa Memo.
Far from producing such additional proof, Abernathy's Ellis and Prevatte admitted in deposition that they had no basis for their allegation that Pall never intended to offer Abernathy a long-term contract:
Q Subsequent to your termination or subsequent to this Renew meeting, did you ever learn of any facts that led you to believe that Pall did not intend to offer long-term contracts when it made that suggestion at that Renew meeting?
A No.
(Ellis Dep. at 101-02),
Q ... At the time of the Renew in '92 program when the issue of long-term contract was discussed, did you have any reason to believe that Pall never intended to offer a long-term contract to Abernathy-Thomas?
A No.
Q And at the time you received and reviewed [the Festa memo], did you have any reason to believe that Pall never intended to offer a long-term contract to Abernathy-Thomas?
A No.
Q At any point prior to being notified of the termination, did you have any reason to believe that Pall never intended to offer Abernathy-Thomas a distribution agreement, a long-term distribution agreement?
A No.
(Prevatte Dep. at 65).
The only evidence that Abernathy cites in support of its claim is Rapone's statement that, as of the time he retired from Pall in 1993, Pall had awarded long-term contracts to only two of its sixty distributors. (Monack Decl. of 9/14/99, Ã Â¸Â 10 (citing Rapone Dep. at 208-09).) If this fact were coupled with evidence showing that many of the other fifty-seven distributors that did not get a long-term contract also met the stated requirements for the contract, such combined evidence might create a triable issue on the question of fraudulent intent. Abernathy, however, has not produced any such evidence. In the absence of such a showing, a reasonable jury could not find that Abernathy has proven a present fraudulent intent by clear and convincing evidence, i.e., proven that it was highly probable that Pall intended to deceive Abernathy when it made its promises at Renew in '92 and in the Festa Memo. Accordingly, Pall's motion for summary judgment on plaintiff's long-term contract fraud claim is granted.

c. The alleged concealment of the decision to terminate Abernathy
As an independent act of fraud, or, to be more accurate, fraudulent concealment, Abernathy claims that Pall had made the decision to terminate Abernathy in July of 1992 or earlier but concealed that fact from Abernathy in order to extract additional information from Abernathy on its customers. Abernathy claims that it would not have signed the SITES amendment in January of 1993 and would have taken steps to prepare its other principals and its customers for the loss of the Pall contract if it had known Pall's decision at an earlier date. (Pl.'s Mem. Opp'n I, at 7-8.)
Pall, on the other hand, claims that it began to look for a replacement for Abernathy only about a month before Abernathy was terminated. Pall further claims that it did not make the final decision to terminate Abernathy until it found a replacement, which was just a few days before it sent notice to Abernathy. See supra Background (8).
Leaving aside the question of whether Pall had any duty to disclose its intentions to Abernathy over and above the thirty-day notice set forth in the Exclusive Distribution Agreement and the Sales Representative Agreement, Abernathy has not produced clear and convincing evidence that Pall in fact made the decision to terminate Abernathy at any time before the *598 date of the SITES amendment, viz., January 18, 1993. During his deposition, Abernathy's Jim Ellis referred to a file memorandum from the week of July 13, 1992, in which he noted that Les Kefauver, an Abernathy sales manager, told him that a Pall employee, Lee Clark (""Clark""), had, in turn, told him that Pall had decided to terminate Abernathy. (Ellis Dep. at 152-53; Letter from Plaintiff's Counsel to Chambers of 5/18/00.) Apparently in an effort to substantiate this claim by way of non-hearsay evidence, Abernathy's counsel drafted a declaration for Clark to sign which recited that Pall had made the decision to terminate Abernathy between May and July of 1992. Clark signed the declaration but Ã Â¹Â tellingly Ã Â¹Â crossed out the language to the effect that the decision had been made by July 1992. Instead, Clark stated in a handwritten note only that two other Pall employees had told him ""at Regional Managers' meetings and in casual conversation during 1992 that Abernathy-Thomas sales performance was being criticized and that Pall was considering terminating Pall's relationship with Abernathy."" (Clark Decl. Ã Â¸Â 3 (emphasis added.))[13] So corrected, Clark's declaration is entirely consistent with Ellis and Prevatte's testimony that Pall had been expressing dissatisfaction with the volume of Abernathy's sales, as well as the size and training of Abernathy's sales force, from 1990 onward and particularly in 1992. (Ellis Dep. at 16-17, 60-65, 126, 156-59, 226; Prevatte Dep. at 16-18, 20, 22-23, 34-36, 85-88.) The Clark declaration simply does not provide clear and convincing evidence upon which a reasonable jury could find that the decision to terminate Abernathy occurred in or before July 1992 and that Pall intentionally concealed this decision from Abernathy until February 11, 1993.
Abernathy also points to the September 23, 1992 meeting between Prevatte, Festa and Rapone, see supra Background (6), in an effort to buttress its claim that Pall deceived Abernathy regarding its alleged intention to terminate Abernathy. (Pl.'s Mem. Opp'n I, at 6.) Accepting Abernathy's account of the meeting as true for the purposes of this motion, see supra note 8, Festa and Rapone's denials that Pall had any problem with Abernathy at the time does not support Abernathy's claim of fraudulent concealment. The argument that those denials do support a finding of fraudulent concealment, presupposes that the decision to terminate had already been made. However, as evidence of that supposition, Abernathy again only cites the Clark declaration. (Pl.'s Mem. Opp'n I, at 6.) But, as just discussed, the Clark declaration does not provide the clear and convincing evidence required to establish that the decision to terminate was made at any time in 1992.
Moreover, in their depositions, Ellis and Prevatte candidly admitted that they had no other basis for their claim that Pall had made the decision to terminate Abernathy long before it gave Abernathy the contractually-required thirty days notice on February 11, 1993:
Q Did you ever learn any information that indicated when Pall had made that decision to terminate Abernathy?
A No.
Q Did you ever learn any information indicating that they had made the decision to terminate Abernathy back in 1992?
A No.
(Ellis Dep. at 120),
Q Did you ever learn any information to indicate to you when it was that Pall made the determination to terminate Abernathy-Thomas?
A No.
Q Did you ever learn any information to indicate that Pall had made a determination to terminate Abernathy-Thomas *599 in 1992 prior to announcing that to Abernathy-Thomas in February 1993?
A No.
(Prevatte Dep. at 66). In light of these admissions and the text of the Clark declaration as sworn to, Abernathy has not produced evidence on which a reasonable jury could find that Abernathy has shown by clear and convincing proof that Pall made the decision to terminate Abernathy prior to the SITES amendment in January of 1993.
Apparently as a fall back argument, Abernathy claims that if Pall had disclosed that it was at least ""considering"" termination in 1992 (as Clark stated in his corrected declaration), Abernathy would have taken steps to reassure its other principals that it would still be able to meet their needs even if it lost the Pall contract. (Pl.'s Mem. Opp'n I, at 7.) This argument, too, fails. As noted above, damages are an essential element of a fraud claim under New York law. It is well-settled under New York law that a fraud action cannot be maintained where the damages attributable to the fraud are speculative or undeterminable. See Lama Holding Co. v. Smith Barney, Inc., 88 N.Y.2d 413, 422, 646 N.Y.S.2d 76, 80, 668 N.E.2d 1370 (1996); Dress Shirt Sales, Inc. v. Hotel Martinique Assocs., 12 N.Y.2d 339, 344, 239 N.Y.S.2d 660, 664, 190 N.E.2d 10 (1963); Geary v. Hunton & Williams, 257 A.D.2d 482, 482, 684 N.Y.S.2d 207, 207 (1st Dep't 1999); Giambrone v. Bank of N.Y., 253 A.D.2d 786, 787, 677 N.Y.S.2d 608, 610 (2d Dep't 1998). Abernathy, however, has produced no evidence Ã Â¹Â much less clear and convincing evidence Ã Â¹Â that if it had taken steps to reassure its other principals, those principals' fears would have been allayed and they would not have terminated their contracts with Abernathy. Indeed, for all that Abernathy has shown, its principals' reaction could have been just the opposite: if Abernathy had disclosed the possible loss of the Pall contract earlier, then to protect themselves Abernathy's principals might just as well have terminated their contracts with Abernathy earlier than they actually did, thus increasing Abernathy's losses. Abernathy's alternative concealment argument, therefore, is not sufficiently supported by admissible evidence to send the fraudulent concealment claim to the jury.[14]

(2)
In Counts II and III of the First Amended Complaint, Abernathy pleads causes of action for misuse of proprietary information and unfair competition, respectively. (First Am. Compl. Ã Â¸ÂÃ Â¸Â 18-20.) The unfair competition claim is, however, based on ""Pall's wrongful disclosure of Abernathy's proprietary information to Fluid Flow,"" and thus essentially restates the misuse of proprietary information claim. *600 (Id. Ã Â¸Â 20.) The two counts will, therefore, be treated as stating a single cause of action. See CBS Corp. v. Dumsday, 268 A.D.2d 350, ___, 702 N.Y.S.2d 248, 251 (1st Dep't 2000); Eagle Comtronics, Inc. v. Pico Prods., Inc., 256 A.D.2d 1202, 1203, 682 N.Y.S.2d 505, 506 (4th Dep't 1998).

a. Applicable Law
To prove a claim for the misappropriation of proprietary information under New York law, plaintiff must show (1) that the information constituted a trade secret, and (2) that the defendant used that trade secret (3) in breach of an agreement, a confidential relationship or duty, or as a result of discovery by improper means. See North Atlantic Instruments, Inc. v. Haber, 188 F.3d 38, 43-44 (2d Cir.1999); Hudson Hotels Corp. v. Choice Hotels Int'l, 995 F.2d 1173, 1176 (2d Cir.1993).
A trade secret is ""`any formula, pattern, device or compilation of information which is used in one's business, and which gives the owner an opportunity to obtain an advantage over competitors who do not know or use it.'"" Ashland Management Inc. v. Janien, 82 N.Y.2d 395, 407, 604 N.Y.S.2d 912, 918, 624 N.E.2d 1007 (1993) (quoting Restatement of Torts Ã Â¸Â 757 cmt. b (1939)); accord North Atlantic Instruments, 188 F.3d at 44. In determining whether information constitutes a trade secret, New York courts consider the following factors:
(1) the extent to which the information is known outside of the business; (2) the extent to which it is known by employees and others involved in the business; (3) the extent of measures taken by the business to guard the secrecy of the information; (4) the value of the information to the business and its competitors; (5) the amount of effort or money expended by the business in developing the information; [and] (6) the ease or difficulty with which the information could be properly acquired or duplicated by others.
Ashland Management, 82 N.Y.2d at 407, 604 N.Y.S.2d at 918, 624 N.E.2d 1007 (quoting Restatement of Torts Ã Â¸Â 757 cmt. b (1939)); accord North Atlantic Instruments, 188 F.3d at 44.
A customer list developed by a business through substantial effort and kept in confidence may be treated as a trade secret and protected at the owner's instance against disclosure to a competitor provided the information it contains is not otherwise readily ascertainable. See Leo Silfen, Inc. v. Cream, 29 N.Y.2d 387, 392-93, 328 N.Y.S.2d 423, 427-28, 278 N.E.2d 636 (1972); North Atlantic Instruments, 188 F.3d at 44. The question of whether or not a customer list is a trade secret is generally a question of fact. See Ashland Management, 82 N.Y.2d at 407, 604 N.Y.S.2d at 918, 624 N.E.2d 1007; North Atlantic Instruments, 188 F.3d at 44.

b. Pall used a trade secret possessed by Abernathy.
Abernathy has alleged that the customer information it supplied to Pall Ã Â¹Â which included not only the identity of its customers but also their filter change-out dates Ã Â¹Â was highly valuable and that it would have taken as many as two years for a new distributor to duplicate the information. Pall has not disputed this time estimate in its papers, and, indeed, the very raison d'Ã Â¹Âtre of its SITES program was a recognition of the commercial value of knowing its customers' change-out dates. Moreover, at oral argument, counsel for Pall expressly conceded that this information was valuable and that it would take a substantial amount of time to develop. (Tr. at 14-15.) Finally, Abernathy's Jim Ellis declared that Abernathy maintained this information as confidential with respect to third-parties. (Ellis Decl. II, Ã Â¸Â 7.) Therefore, on the evidence now before the court, a reasonable jury could find that Abernathy's customer information constituted a trade secret as defined by New York law.
As for the element of use, Pall argues that even if Abernathy's customer information *601 qualifies as a trade secret, Abernathy has produced no evidence that Pall actually gave Fluid Flow Abernathy's customer information. However, Pall's Festa admitted during his deposition that SITES information was given to Fluid Flow when it signed on as Pall's new distributor in the Territory. (Festa Dep. at 85-86.) Thus, while it is unclear on the present record exactly how much of Abernathy's customer information was supplied to Fluid Flow, a reasonable jury could find that Pall disclosed at least some of Abernathy's customer information to Fluid Flow and, hence, that Abernathy has met its burden of proving misuse of its trade secrets.

c. Abernathy stood in a confidential relationship with Pall, pursuant to which Pall owed Abernathy a duty of fidelity.
There has been, and can be, no suggestion that Pall discovered Abernathy's customer information through improper means (e.g., industrial espionage), inasmuch as Pall obtained the information directly from Abernathy, with Abernathy's knowledge and consent, pursuant to a contractual obligation that required it to supply Pall with that information. The dispositive issue with respect to Abernathy's trade secrets claim is, therefore, whether Pall's use of Abernathy's customer information constituted a breach of a confidential relationship with or duty owed to Abernathy.
As an initial matter, it is clear that Pall did not have a contractual duty to keep Abernathy's customer information in confidence. The Agreement between Pall and Abernathy contains no express confidentiality clause in favor of Abernathy, and Abernathy's management conceded in deposition that Pall never orally agreed to keep the information in confidence.[15] Plaintiff's cause of action for misappropriation of its trade secrets, thus, reduces to the question of whether a confidential relationship existed between the parties that gave rise to a legal duty on defendant's part not to use that information to the detriment of plaintiff Ã Â¹Â in short, whether the factual contours of their relationship created a duty of fidelity on defendant's part.
This inquiry encompasses two distinct questions, one of law and one of fact. The first question Ã Â¹Â whether, given the facts regarding the two companies' relationship alleged by plaintiff, defendant owed plaintiff a duty Ã Â¹Â is a question of law for the court to determine. See Kimmell v. Schaefer, 89 N.Y.2d 257, 263, 652 N.Y.S.2d 715, 718, 675 N.E.2d 450 (1996); Palka v. Servicemaster Management Servs. Corp., 83 N.Y.2d 579, 585, 611 N.Y.S.2d 817, 820, 634 N.E.2d 189 (1994); Eiseman v. State, 70 N.Y.2d 175, 187, 518 N.Y.S.2d 608, 613, 511 N.E.2d 1128 (1987). The secondÃ Â¹Âwhether the facts of the relationship were as plaintiff alleges Ã Â¹Â is a question of fact for the jury. See Kimmell, 89 N.Y.2d at 263, 652 N.Y.S.2d at 718, 675 N.E.2d 450. Thus, on this motion for summary judgment, the court must resolve two questions: (1) accepting plaintiff's factual allegations regarding its relationship with Pall as true, did Pall owe Abernathy a duty as a matter of law?, and *602 (2) on the evidence presented to the court, could a reasonable jury find that the facts of the relationship were as Abernathy alleges? Both questions are answered in the affirmative.
Under New York law, a ""distributorship agreement may, in some rare instances, create a confidential relationship out of which duty of fiduciary care arises."" Lake Erie Distributors, Inc. v. Martlet Importing Co., 221 A.D.2d 954, 955, 634 N.Y.S.2d 599, 601 (4th Dep't 1995) (citing A.S. Rampell, Inc. v. Hyster Co., 3 N.Y.2d 369, 165 N.Y.S.2d 475, 144 N.E.2d 371 (1957); Zimmer-Masiello, Inc. v. Zimmer, Inc., 159 A.D.2d 363, 552 N.Y.S.2d 935 (1st Dep't), appeal dismissed, 76 N.Y.2d 772, 559 N.Y.S.2d 986, 559 N.E.2d 680 (1990)); see also Guard-Life Corp. v. S. Parker Hardware Mfg. Corp., 50 N.Y.2d 183, 194, 428 N.Y.S.2d 628, 634, 406 N.E.2d 445 (1980) (noting that duty of fidelity may arise from a relationship of confidence and citing Rampell); cf. W. Walley, Inc. v. Saks & Co., 266 A.D. 193, 198, 41 N.Y.S.2d 739, 743 (1st Dep't 1943) (relationship between department store and credit card issuer that supplied information on its customers to department store was one of confidence); Matter of Sbarro Holding, Inc., 111 Misc. 2d 910, 913, 445 N.Y.S.2d 911, 914 (1981) (relationship between large corporate franchisor and individual franchisee was one of confidence), aff'd, 91 A.D.2d 613, 456 N.Y.S.2d 416 (2d Dep't 1982).
In Rampell, the New York Court of Appeals denied a manufacturer's motion to dismiss a former distributor's complaint for the misappropriation of the distributor's sales staff and goodwill, holding that on the facts alleged by the distributor, a confidential relationship had arisen between the two. See Rampell, 3 N.Y.2d at 377, 165 N.Y.S.2d at 482, 144 N.E.2d 371. The Rampell distributor alleged that it had been the defendant manufacturer's exclusive distributor in a particular territory for fifteen years and that it had expended substantial amounts of money, time and effort to develop, and had in fact developed, a sales organization and market for the manufacturer's products. See id. at 374, 165 N.Y.S.2d at 480, 144 N.E.2d 371. The relationship was brought to an abrupt end when the manufacturer terminated the distributorship agreement, hired the plaintiff's key sales people, and began direct sales in the former distributor's territory. See id. at 375, 165 N.Y.S.2d at 480, 144 N.E.2d 371.
In deciding whether the manufacturer's inducement of the distributor's employees to terminate their employment agreements with the distributor was tortious, the Court of Appeals first observed that the relationship between a distributor and a manufacturer is generally not a relationship of ""economic equals,"" but rather a relationship ""which is recognized to be that of dependency of the latter upon the former."" Id. at 376, 165 N.Y.S.2d at 481, 144 N.E.2d 371 (citations omitted). The court warned, however, that ""[t]his dominance taken alone may be insufficient to show such a relation of confidence as would make the action by [the manufacturer] here actionable."" Id. The Court of Appeals found additional facts sufficient to support a finding of a confidential relationship where
[p]ursuant to the contract ..., plaintiff was obliged to make its lists of prospective customers available to [the manufacturer]; to keep records of its demonstrating, canvassing and soliciting available to [the manufacturer]; to give [the manufacturer] reports on its inventory and its financial condition, or `any other information regarding [the distributor's] business which may be reasonably required by [the manufacturer].'
Id. at 377, 165 N.Y.S.2d at 482, 144 N.E.2d 371.
On the basis of similar allegations, the Appellate Division found that a confidential relationship existed between manufacturer and distributor in Zimmer. The Zimmer plaintiff had acted as the exclusive *603 distributor of the defendant's surgical equipment and orthopedic supplies. See Zimmer, 159 A.D.2d at 364, 552 N.Y.S.2d at 936. After an eleven-year relationship, the manufacturer terminated the distribution agreement, hired many of the distributor's employees, and began direct sales to the distributor's former customers. See id. The Appellate Division found that the plaintiff distributor had established the existence of a fiduciary duty on the part of the manufacturer where
[t]he manufacturer ... maintained a position of dominance and the plaintiff was dependent on Zimmer during the relationship of more than 11 years. Zimmer dictated the size of Masiello's territory, prices and commissions, and, as in Rampell, exploited the same type of confidential and proprietary information which Masiello was required to provide Zimmer pursuant to agreement.
Id. at 365, 552 N.Y.S.2d at 937.
Whether Abernathy's allegations regarding the nature of its relationship with Pall are sufficiently analogous to those in Rampell and Zimmer to support a finding that the relationship was one of confidence is a close question. In some respects the facts of this case (as alleged by Abernathy) are stronger than in Rampell and Zimmer, and in other respects, weaker. However, viewed as a whole they are sufficient to establish that the relationship between Pall and Abernathy was confidential in nature and gave rise to a duty on Pall's part not to misuse Abernathy's proprietary customer information to Abernathy's detriment.
As in Rampell and Zimmer, the Exclusive Distribution Agreement imposed on Abernathy an obligation to report to Pall all of its sales of Pall products, the names and addresses of Abernathy's customers, and the types of filters they used. In addition, pursuant to a long-standing extra-contractual practice, Pall employees frequently accompanied Abernathy sales-people on customer visits, thus giving Pall direct access to the identity of the appropriate contact people at Abernathy's customers, as well as an opportunity to assess those customers' potential future needs for filtration products. Finally, pursuant to the SITES amendment, Abernathy was also required to supply Pall with concededly valuable information on filter element change-out dates.
Furthermore, these contractually-required disclosures took place over the course of a much longer-term relationship than existed in the Rampell and Zimmer cases, viz., forty or more years as opposed to fifteen and eleven years, respectively. In addition, just as in Rampell, Abernathy has alleged that prior to its investment of substantial money, time and effort, Pall had a few sales in the territory Abernathy covered. Finally, the evidence submitted on this motion confirms the Court of Appeals's general suppositions that a manufacturer enjoys a position of dominance over the distributor and that the two do not bargain at arms length: sales of Pall products constituted the bulk of Abernathy's revenues, and Pall was, therefore, able to place numerous demands on Abernathy over the years, including an alleged requirement that Abernathy help facilitate a potentially illegal scheme to inflate Pall's publicly-reported sales figures, see supra Background (10); infra Discussion (5).
On the other hand, the acts constituting the alleged breach of the confidential relationship in this case are, of course, far less egregious than those in Rampell or Zimmer. Pall did not usurp any of Abernathy's employees; nor did it commence direct sales after the termination. Instead, Pall only hired another distributor, and Abernathy has not produced any evidence to suggest that Pall terminated Abernathy for any reason other than a desire to have a better distributor in the Territory.[16]*604 The crucial lesson of Rampell and Zimmer for this case, however, is that a long-standing distributorship relationship in which the manufacturer dominated the distributor, and pursuant to which the distributor was contractually required to disclose proprietary information regarding its customers to the manufacturer, creates a duty on the part of the manufacturer not to use that information to the detriment of the distributor. Thus, while the equities of this case are much less compelling than in Rampell or Zimmer, the fact that the manufacturer's duty of fidelity was breached in a different manner in this case is irrelevant for the purposes of establishing whether such a duty existed in the first place.[17]
In light of the foregoing, the second question posed by the present motion Ã Â¹Â whether a reasonable jury could find that Pall and Abernathy did in fact stand in the type of confidential relationship described in Rampell and Zimmer Ã Â¹Â almost answers itself. Pall has not disputed any of the facts relevant to the question of whether a confidential relationship existed between the two companies, e.g., the length of the relationship, Abernathy's efforts to develop customers for Pall's products, or the fact that Pall contractually required Abernathy to turn over its customer information. Accordingly, Abernathy's trade secrets claim is sufficiently well-supported as a matter of both law and fact to present a triable issue for the jury.

d. The Exclusive Distribution Agreement did not give Pall a contractual right to supply Abernathy's customer information to the new distributor.
As a defense to Abernathy's trade secrets claim, Pall suggests a reading of the Exclusive Distribution Agreement pursuant to which it had a contractual right to supply Fluid Flow with Abernathy's customer information. Under New York law, a person may, in some circumstances, modify a common law duty that he owes to another through a contract freely and voluntarily entered into by the other, provided that the person does not thereby purport to relieve himself of an independent duty that he owes to the public. See 22 N.Y. Jur.2d Contracts Ã Â¸Â 188, at 226 (1996) (citing Johnston v. Fargo, 184 N.Y. 379, 77 N.E. 388 (1906)). Assuming for the sake of argument that Pall's duty of fidelity to Abernathy *605 can be waived by contract, Pall's defense, nonetheless, fails because the interpretation of the Agreement that Pall offers in support of its argument must be rejected as contrary to general principles of contract interpretation.
Pall's argument proceeds by reference to two separate provisions of the Agreement. First, Pall notes that Paragraph (f) of the section of the Agreement entitled ""Certain Covenants of the Distributor"" gave Pall the right to ""use [its distributor's customer] information as it sees fit to aid in the distribution, marketing, sales, promotion, or manufacture of its Products."" (Ortego Affirm., Ex. C, Ã Â¸Â IV(f).) Next, Pall notes that Paragraph (b) of the section entitled ""Termination"" gave it the right to appoint a new distributor upon termination of the Agreement. (Id. Ã Â¸Â VIII(b).) Pall then reasons that, when read together, the two provisions give it the right to supply a former distributor's customer information to a new distributor, as long as doing so will aid in the distribution, marketing, sales, promotion, or manufacture of Pall's products. (Def.'s Mem. Supp. I, at 14; Def.'s Reply Mem. Supp. Def.'s Mot. Summ. J. at 6-7 [hereinafter Def.'s Mem. Supp. II].)
Not surprisingly, Abernathy disputes this interpretation and denies that it intended to accord Pall any such right when it signed the Agreement. (Pl.'s Mem. Opp'n I, at 13-14.) Inasmuch as the interpretation of a contract is a question of law, see Hudson Iron Works, Inc. v. Beys Specialty Contracting, Inc., 262 A.D.2d 360, 362, 691 N.Y.S.2d 132, 133 (2d Dep't 1999); National Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh, Pa. v. Robert Christopher Assocs., 257 A.D.2d 1, 11, 691 N.Y.S.2d 35, 43 (1st Dep't 1999), the court will undertake its own interpretation of the Agreement.
As an initial matter, the obvious purposes of the disclosure provision of Ã Â¸Â IV(f) would appear, on a fair reading of the Agreement, to be two-fold: (1) to allow Pall to monitor its distributor's performance and (2) to track the sales of its products so that it could effectively channel its marketing and product development efforts. Nothing in the language of Ã Â¸Â IV(f) when considered alone even hints that by signing the Agreement, its distributors agree to give Pall the right to use their customer information in a way that would injure the distributors.
Of course, Pall's argument is that Ã Â¸Â IV(f) should not be read in isolation. However, Ã Â¸Â IV(f) and the termination provision upon which Pall relies in framing its interpretation occur in two completely different sections of the Agreement, which are separated by several pages and each of which contains numerous other provisions. In light of the apparent purposes of Ã Â¸Â IV(f) and the relative placement of the two provisions within the contract, Pall's argument that Abernathy should have drawn the purported connection between Ã Â¸ÂÃ Â¸Â IV(f) and VIII(b), (see Def.'s Mem. Supp. I, at 14), is patently unreasonable.
Moreover, three canonical principles of contract interpretation counsel against giving the Agreement the construction Pall wishes to place upon it. First, clauses that limit a contracting party's common law liability, while not necessarily invalid, are to be strictly construed. See Terminal Central, Inc. v. Henry Modell & Co., 212 A.D.2d 213, 218, 628 N.Y.S.2d 56, 59 (1st Dep't 1995); Zoller v. Niagara Mohawk Power Corp., 137 A.D.2d 947, 950, 525 N.Y.S.2d 364, 367 (3d Dep't 1988); 22 N.Y. Jur.2d Contracts Ã Â¸Â 273 (1996). Here, the general language of Ã Â¸Â IV(f)'s provision that Pall may make use of its distributor's customer information in any way that it see fits cannot by itself encompass a use of that information that would otherwise subject Pall to liability for breach of a duty of fidelity owed to the distributor. The principle of strict construction of exculpatory clauses requires that such a consequence be expressly stated, not merely implied. Pall's invocation of language from a separate section of the Agreement giving it the right to appoint a new distributor falls far short of such an express statement.
*606 For much the same reason, the principle that contracts should be interpreted so as to avoid unfair or anomalous consequences also argues against Pall's interpretation. See Browning-Ferris Indus. of N.Y., Inc. v. County of Monroe, 103 A.D.2d 1040, 1041, 478 N.Y.S.2d 428, 430 (4th Dep't 1984); 22 N.Y. Jur.2d Contracts Ã Â¸Â 222 (1996). The implicit waiver of Pall's duty of fidelity that Pall reads into the Agreement is just such an unfair and surprising result.
In light of these observations, the Agreement is, at best, ambiguous as to whether Pall had the contractual right to supply Abernathy's successor with Abernathy's customer information. In accordance with the interpretive principle that ambiguities in a written contract are to be construed against the drafter, see Jacobson v. Sassower, 66 N.Y.2d 991, 993, 499 N.Y.S.2d 381, 382, 489 N.E.2d 1283 (1985); Garcia v. American Gen. Life Ins. Co. of New York, 264 A.D.2d 808, 809, 695 N.Y.S.2d 420, 421 (2d Dep't 1999); 22 N.Y. Jur.2d Contracts Ã Â¸Â 260 (1996)Ã Â¹Âhere, Pall Ã Â¹Â the reading of the Agreement urged by Pall, and hence its contract-based defense to Abernathy's trade secret claim, must be rejected. The Agreement did not give Pall a contractual right to supply Abernathy's replacement with the information supplied to Pall by Abernathy pursuant to Ã Â¸Â IV(f).

e. Damages
If the jury finds Pall liable on Abernathy's trade secret claim, that finding would not imply that Abernathy is entitled to damages for all sales of filtration products lost to Fluid Flow for an indefinitely long period of time after the termination. The proper measure of damages for unfair competition and for the misappropriation and exploitation of confidential information is the loss of profits sustained by reason of the improper conduct. See Allan Dampf, P.C. v. Bloom, 127 A.D.2d 719, 720, 512 N.Y.S.2d 116, 117 (2d Dep't 1987). Thus, Pall would be liable only for the profits that Abernathy would have earned on sales that were lost to Fluid Flow after the termination as a result of Pall having supplied Fluid Flow with confidential customer information Fluid Flow did not already possess.[18]
In addition, the extent to which Abernathy's damages were caused by Pall's misuse of Abernathy's customer information necessarily changed over time. Abernathy has alleged that it would take a minimum of several months, (Tr. at 12), and possibly as long as two years, (Ellis Decl. I, Ã Â¸Â 19), for Fluid Flow to duplicate Abernathy's customer information. This places an outer bound of two years on the period during which Abernathy's lost profits could be attributed to Pall's alleged breach of its duty of fidelity. By Abernathy's own estimate then, Fluid Flow could have developed through its own efforts the same customer information possessed by Abernathy on the second anniversary of the termination, i.e., by March of 1995. At that point, had there been no breach by Pall, Abernathy and Fluid Flow would have legitimately possessed the same knowledge of the filter market in the Territory, and any sale Abernathy lost to Fluid Flow would have to be due to the *607 customer's preference for Pall filters or superior marketing by Fluid Flow.
In sum, under the facts of this case, the appropriate measure of damages is (1) the amount of the profits that Abernathy would have earned on sales Abernathy lost to Fluid Flow (2) as a result of Fluid Flow's use of Abernathy's customer information (3) from the date on which Abernathy's termination became effective (4) until the date on which Fluid Flow could have, through the exercise of reasonable diligence, finished compiling that information on its own. In light of Abernathy's own estimates, the latter date could not be later than March 11, 1995, i.e., the date two years after Abernathy's termination became effective.
Abernathy's potential damages are subject to two final factual considerations. First, Pall could escape liability for sales to particular customers if it could show that Fluid Flow was already familiar with those customers before Pall supplied it with any of Abernathy's information. On this point, Abernathy's Jim Ellis alleged in deposition that Fluid Flow did not sell industrial filters prior to signing on as Pall's new distributor. (Ellis Dep. at 117.) On what basis Ellis had personal knowledge of that fact (so as to render his testimony admissible) is unclear. Nevertheless, leaving that question aside and assuming that his statement is accurate, the fact that Fluid Flow did not previously sell industrial filters would not show that Fluid Flow did not share some customers with Abernathy. For all that has been shown at this point, Fluid Flow may have previously marketed other types of industrial supplies to some of the same industrial customers to whom Abernathy had sold Pall filters. In that case, there would be nothing improper about Fluid Flow advising existing customers that it was now distributing filtration products as well and making any sales that resulted from advertising that fact.
The second remaining relevant factual consideration regarding possible damages limits the impact of the first. One of the principal issues in this case is Pall's misuse of information developed by Abernathy on customer change-out dates. Even if Abernathy and Fluid Flow shared a particular customer before Pall disclosed any of Abernathy's proprietary information to Fluid Flow, Pall would still be liable to Abernathy for lost profits if Fluid Flow was able to beat Abernathy to the sale of replacement filter elements as a result of Pall's disclosure of Abernathy-generated SITES information.
On the record presently before the court, no evidence relevant to any of these damages issues appears to have been developed by either of the parties. Indeed, at the present time, there is no admissible evidence on which damages, as outlined above, could be proven with reasonable certainty. Jim Ellis's allegations on these issues consist either of statements which appear to be beyond his personal knowledge, viz., his statements regarding the identity of Fluid Flow's existing customers, or hearsay allegations, viz., his testimony that former customers told him that they had been contacted by Fluid Flow salespeople. (See Ellis Dep. at 115-17.) The only admissible evidence now before the court on causation of damages is Festa's party admission that Pall provided SITES information to Fluid Flow when it took over as Pall's new distributor in the Territory. (See Festa Dep. at 86-87.) This general admission provides no basis on which a jury could quantify damages.
The parties' failure to develop relevant evidence on damages appears to be attributable the parties' understandable focus up to this point on the question of liability. For this reason, summary judgment on the issue of damages would be premature at this stage of the litigation. The interest of justice would be better served by allowing the parties to take additional discovery on the limited issue of the amount, if any, of Abernathy's damages caused by Pall's alleged misuse of Abernathy's customer information. Such evidence could consist of, inter alia, business records from either *608 Fluid Flow or Pall, or customer affidavits, indicating that Fluid Flow sold Pall products to former Abernathy customers shortly after the termination and that these customers were not existing Fluid Flow customers. Also relevant would be evidence from those same sources showing that shortly after the termination, Fluid Flow made sales of Pall products to former Abernathy customers on the relevant filter change-out dates.

(3)
Abernathy's next claim is that by terminating the distributorship, Pall tortiously interfered with its contracts with its customers and other principals. Specifically, Abernathy asserts that DuPont terminated a supply contract with Abernathy, and a principal called Thermon terminated a distributorship agreement with Abernathy, after they learned that Abernathy lost the Pall contract. (Ellis Dep. at 273; Ellis Decl. I, Ã Â¸Â 16.) According to Abernathy, DuPont was concerned that Abernathy would not be able to find another supplier of filtration products soon enough to meet its needs, and Thermon was concerned that without the Pall contract, Abernathy would not be able to maintain a large enough sales force to promote its products. (Id.) Neither allegation states a claim for tortious interference with contract.
To prove tortious interference with contract under New York law, plaintiff must show: (1) the existence of a contract between plaintiff and a third party; (2) defendant's knowledge of the contract; (3) defendant's intentional procurement of the third party to breach or otherwise render performance impossible; and (4) damages to plaintiff. See Lama Holding Co. v. Smith Barney Inc., 88 N.Y.2d 413, 424, 646 N.Y.S.2d 76, 82, 668 N.E.2d 1370 (1996); Shannon v. MTA Metro-North R.R., 269 A.D.2d 218, 704 N.Y.S.2d 208, 209 (1st Dep't 2000); Velazquez v. Lackmann Food Servs. at Old Country Rd., Inc., 251 A.D.2d 495, 496, 674 N.Y.S.2d 413, 414 (2d Dep't 1998). Abernathy did not even implicitly allege knowledge or intentional procurement in its First Amended Complaint. (See First Am. Compl. Ã Â¸Â 21.) Moreover, on this motion, Abernathy has produced absolutely no evidence that Pall knew of its contracts with DuPont or Thermon, nor that Pall had any contact with DuPont or Thermon at any time, much less that Pall took any actions that could be construed as intentionally procuring those companies to terminate their contracts with Abernathy.
In its opposition brief, Abernathy argues that it need only show that, but for Pall's terminating the distributorship, DuPont and Thermon would not have terminated their contracts with Abernathy. (Pl.'s Mem. Opp'n I, at 16.) That is simply not a correct statement of New York law. While it is certainly true that, in order to prove causation of damages, Abernathy must make a threshold showing that Pall's actions were a ""but for"" cause of its losing those other contracts, by itself that showing is not sufficient by itself to prove Abernathy's tortious interference claim: Pall's knowledge of the contracts and its intentional procurement of their termination are required as well. See Lama Holding, 88 N.Y.2d at 424, 646 N.Y.S.2d at 82, 668 N.E.2d 1370; Shannon, ___ A.D.2d at ___, 704 N.Y.S.2d at 209; Lackmann Food Servs., 251 A.D.2d at 496, 674 N.Y.S.2d at 414. Accordingly, Pall's motion for summary judgment on Abernathy's tortious interference claim is granted.

(4)
In Count V of its First Amended Complaint, Abernathy asserts that, as a result of their longstanding relationship and Pall's position of dominance over Abernathy, Pall had a fiduciary duty (1) not to terminate Abernathy's distributorship, and (2) ""to truthfully disclose in a timely manner to Abernathy all material information concerning such role."" (First Am. Compl. Ã Â¸Â 22; see Pl.'s Mem. Opp'n I, at 9-11.) Abernathy claims that by concealing *609 its intention to terminate Abernathy and, ultimately, by terminating Abernathy, Pall breached this fiduciary duty. (Id.)
Both prongs of this claim must be rejected. Although, on the facts alleged by Abernathy, Pall does owe Abernathy a fiduciary duty with respect to Abernathy's trade secrets, that fiduciary duty is limited in scope and does not encompass the obligations asserted by Abernathy in its claim for breach of fiduciary duty.
First, Abernathy's assertion that Pall did not have the right to terminate the relationship at all is patently false: The Exclusive Distribution Agreement and the Sales Representative Agreement expressly give both parties the right to terminate the relationship at any time, with or without cause, on thirty days notice. (See Ortego Affirm., Ex. C, Ã Â¸Â VIII(a); id., Ex. D, Ã Â¸Â VI(a), (c).) Moreover, even if Pall and Abernathy had actually stood in that quintessential fiduciary relationship, the partnership, see Meinhard v. Salmon, 249 N.Y. 458, 463-64, 164 N.E. 545, 546 (1928) (Cardozo, C.J.), Pall would have had the right to terminate the relationship at any time, absent an agreement to the contrary, see N.Y. Partnership Law Ã Â¸Â 62(1)(b) (McKinney 1988); 15 N.Y. Jur.2d Business Relationships Ã Â¸Â 1655 (1996). Of course, if one partner misappropriates a partnership asset or business opportunity and then dissolves the partnership, the misappropriating former partner may be liable for breach of fiduciary duty to the other former partner(s). See 15 N.Y. Jur.2d Business Relationships Ã Â¸ÂÃ Â¸Â 1458, 1467-68 (1996). The fact that there would be liability in that situation provides no support for Abernathy's claim, however, because, in such a case, the breach of fiduciary duty lies in the misappropriation, not in the simple fact of termination. Since Abernathy is apparently relying only on the fact of the termination to support its breach of fiduciary duty claim, the first prong of its fiduciary duty claim must be dismissed.
Turning to the second prong of Abernathy's breach of fiduciary duty claim, Pall did not have a duty to disclose its alleged intentions to terminate Abernathy beyond its contractual duty to give Abernathy thirty days notice. Nothing in Rampell or Zimmer suggests otherwise. In fact, in Rampell Ã Â¹Â a case otherwise helpful to Abernathy, the distributor had contested the validity of a provision in its contract with the defendant manufacturer that allowed the manufacturer to terminate without any prior notice. The New York Court of Appeals rejected this claim and upheld the manufacturer's exercise of the provision Ã Â¹Â despite having previously found that the manufacturer was in a position of dominance over the distributor and that the relationship was a longstanding one. See Rampell, 3 N.Y.2d at 380-82, 165 N.Y.S.2d at 485-86, 144 N.E.2d 371. Even in those circumstances, the Court of Appeals held that the distributor was legally entitled to no more than a reasonable notice period, a right which could be, and was in that case, validly waived by contract. See id. at 381-82, 165 N.Y.S.2d at 486, 144 N.E.2d 371.
Nonetheless, Abernathy argues that the mere fact that Pall was in a position of superior knowledge with regard to its own intentions regarding the future of the relationship gave it a fiduciary duty to disclose those intentions. (Pl.'s Mem. Opp'n I, at 10-11.) In so arguing, Abernathy is not, to be perfectly precise, stating a breach of fiduciary duty claim. Instead, Abernathy is simply recasting its fraudulent concealment claim on the basis of the principle that, in the absence of a fiduciary relationship, a duty to disclose may arise that will support a fraudulent concealment claim if, inter alia, ""`one party possesses superior knowledge, not readily available to the other, and knows that the other is acting on the basis of mistaken knowledge.'"" Remington Rand Corp. v. Amsterdam Rotterdam Bank, N.V., 68 F.3d 1478, 1484 (2d Cir.1995) (quoting Aaron Ferer & Sons Ltd. v. Chase Manhattan Bank, 731 F.2d 112, 123 (2d Cir.1984) (applying New York *610 law)). So recast, Abernathy's fraudulent concealment claim fails to present a triable issue for the same reasons previously discussed: viz., Abernathy has not produced clear and convincing evidence either (1) that Pall made the decision to terminate Abernathy before it gave the contractually required notice or (2) that Abernathy suffered damage as a result of the alleged concealment of the possibility that Abernathy would be terminated. See supra Discussion (1)(c).
Accordingly, Pall's motion for summary judgment on Abernathy's breach of fiduciary duty claim is granted.

(5)
Both parties have moved for summary judgment on Abernathy's claim that it is due $62,867 pursuant to an alleged oral agreement whereby Pall promised to pay Abernathy a special five percent commission, over and above the regular commission, on certain nuclear filters in exchange for Abernathy's storing the filters at its facilities.

a. Pall's Motion for Summary Judgment
Pall makes two arguments in support of its motion for summary judgment on Abernathy's special commissions claim: one based on the Statute of Frauds, and the other based on the statute of limitations. Each is considered in turn below.

i. Statute of Frauds
Pall argues that the oral agreement alleged by Abernathy is a contract for the sale of goods valued in excess of $500 and, thus, is subject to the statute of frauds provision of Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code. See N.Y. U.C.C. Ã Â¸Â 2-201 (McKinney 1993). Although Abernathy is correct that the agreement it alleges is not one for the sale of goods as defined in the U.C.C., but rather a services contract, (see Pl.'s Mem. Opp'n Def.'s Cross-Mot. Summ. J. at 5-6 [hereinafter Pl.'s Mem. Opp'n II]) (discussing N.Y. U.C.C. Ã Â¸Â 2-106(1) (McKinney 1993)), the agreement does, nonetheless, fall within the Statute of Frauds.
Under New York General Obligations Law Ã Â¸Â 5-701(a)(1) (McKinney 1989), an agreement that, by its terms, is not capable of performance within one year from the time that it is made is void unless it is evidenced by a written note or memorandum subscribed to by the party against whom its enforcement is sought. Because payment on a commission agreement depends not on the will of the parties to the agreement, but on the contingent action of a third-party, viz., the buyer, New York courts have held that commission agreements that have no specified termination date are agreements that are not capable of performance within one year of their making within the meaning of Ã Â¸Â 5-701(a)(1). See North Shore Bottling Co. v. C. Schmidt & Sons Inc., 22 N.Y.2d 171, 177-78, 292 N.Y.S.2d 86, 90-91, 239 N.E.2d 189 (1968); Agee v. Read Q Sys., Inc., 70 A.D.2d 805, 805, 417 N.Y.S.2d 494, 495 (1st Dep't 1979); 61 N.Y. Jur.2d Frauds, Statute of Ã Â¸Â 39, at 92-93 (1987); see also Currier v. Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., 266 A.D.2d 596, 597, 697 N.Y.S.2d 774, 775 (3d Dep't 1999) (holding that oral brokerage agreement falls within the Statute of Frauds since its performance depends on the will of a third-party). As an exception to this rule, a commission agreement will be deemed performable within one year if it is terminable at any time upon the will of one or both of the parties, or upon the performance of an act within the control of one of the parties. See North Shore Bottling, 22 N.Y.2d at 177-78, 292 N.Y.S.2d at 90-91;, 239 N.E.2d 189 61 N.Y. Jur.2d Frauds, Statute of Ã Â¸Â 39, at 93 (1987). However, to remove an agreement from the Statute of Frauds, the power to terminate a contract must be an express term of the agreement. See D & N Boening, Inc. v. Kirsch Beverages, Inc., 63 N.Y.2d 449, 456, 483 N.Y.S.2d 164, 167, 472 N.E.2d 992 (1984) (holding that ""explicit option to terminate"" takes agreement out *611 of Statute of Frauds (emphasis added)); Burke v. Bevona, 866 F.2d 532, 538 (2d Cir.1989) (""The New York cases uniformly hold that implied termination terms are not sufficient to take an oral contract out of the statute. The terms must be express.""); Volmar Distribs., Inc. v. New York Post Co., 825 F. Supp. 1153, 1168 (S.D.N.Y.1993).
In this case, Abernathy alleges that the commissions accrued when a customer ordered a nuclear filter from Pall and Abernathy shipped the invoiced filters back to Pall. (Pl.'s Mem. Opp'n II, at 3.) Hence, performance of the contract was dependent on contingent actions of a third-party, viz., whether a customer ordered a nuclear filter, that might have occurred more than one year after the agreement was made. Moreover, Abernathy has made no allegations and has presented no evidence regarding the conditions under which the agreement was terminable or whether it had any specific termination date. Thus, Abernathy has not shown the existence of termination conditions that would remove the agreement from the reach of General Obligations Law Ã Â¸Â 5-701(a)(1). Consequently, in order for the oral commissions agreement to be enforceable, Abernathy must produce a note or memorandum subscribed to by Pall that evidences the agreement.
On a motion for summary judgment, the question of whether a note or memorandum is on its face sufficient to satisfy the Statute of Frauds is a matter of law for the court to decide. See Bazak Int'l Corp. v. Mast Indus., Inc., 73 N.Y.2d 113, 118, 538 N.Y.S.2d 503, 505, 535 N.E.2d 633 (1989) (Kaye, J.); Rohrwasser v. Al & Lou Constr. Co., 82 A.D.2d 1008, 1008, 442 N.Y.S.2d 171, 172 (3d Dep't 1981); Lashway v. Sorell, 51 A.D.2d 97, 98, 380 N.Y.S.2d 334, 336 (3d Dep't 1976); Merex A.G. v. Fairchild Weston Sys., Inc., 810 F. Supp. 1356, 1367 (S.D.N.Y.1993), aff'd, 29 F.3d 821 (2d Cir.1994). In Bazak, the New York Court of Appeals held that a trial court erred in ruling that the sufficiency of writings to satisfy the Statute of Frauds is a matter of fact to be determined at trial. See Bazak, 73 N.Y.2d at 118, 538 N.Y.S.2d at 505, 535 N.E.2d 633. Instead, the court explained, ""[t]hat issue must be determined from the documents themselves, as a matter of law,"" for ""[c]onsideration of parol evidence in assessing the adequacy of a writing for Statute of Frauds purposes would otherwise undermine the very reason for a Statute of Frauds in the first instance."" Id. Therefore, it is necessary to examine the principles for assessing the sufficiency of writing that are relevant to this case.
First, the note or memorandum requirement may be satisfied by a single writing or by a series of writings, provided they express all essential terms of the agreement. See Henry L. Fox Co. v. William Kaufman Org., Ltd., 74 N.Y.2d 136, 140, 544 N.Y.S.2d 565, 567, 542 N.E.2d 1082 (1989); Syman v. Vanderheuval, 249 A.D.2d 870, 872, 672 N.Y.S.2d 454, 455-56 (3d Dep't 1998); V. Ponte & Sons, Inc. v. American Fibers Int'l, 222 A.D.2d 271, 271, 635 N.Y.S.2d 193, 194 (1st Dep't 1995). Moreover, the writing(s) must express those terms with reasonable definiteness and certainty, so that the substance thereof will appear from the writing(s) without any resort to parol evidence. See Ward v. Hasbrouck, 169 N.Y. 407, 411, 62 N.E. 434, 435 (1902); Aceste v. Wiebusch, 74 A.D.2d 810, 810, 425 N.Y.S.2d 369, 370 (2d Dep't 1980); Dorman v. Cohen, 66 A.D.2d 411, 412, 413 N.Y.S.2d 377, 378-79 (1st Dep't 1979); 61 N.Y. Jur.2d Frauds, Statute of Ã Â¸Â 156, at 244 (1987).
In view of the correspondence between Abernathy and Pall, and Festa's admissions, there plainly was some type of agreement along the lines alleged by Abernathy. See supra Background (10). But, contrary to Abernathy's argument, that correspondence does not establish all of the essential terms of the agreement. Specifically, the correspondence does not unambiguously support Abernathy's allegation *612 that the special commission was to be five percent on all nuclear filters stored pursuant to the agreement.
In a memorandum from Rapone to Ellis dated April 8, 1993, Rapone states that on certain orders ""Pall paid 10%. Should have paid 15%."" (Everts Aff., Ex. A, Memorandum from Rapone to Ellis of 4/8/93, at 1.) This statement tends to confirm Abernathy's description of the commission agreement. However, in discussing other orders, Rapone stated that ""Pall paid 12.5%. Should have paid 15%."" (Id. at 1-2.) The Exclusive Distribution Agreement commission schedule provides for three different rates depending on the type of nuclear filter sold: 12.5%, 10%, and 7%. (Ortego Affirm., Ex. C, Exclusive Distribution Agreement Between Pall Trinity Micro and Abernathy, App. D, Ã Â¸Â B.) The Rapone memorandum provides specific part numbers for the orders that were paid at 12.5% instead of 15%, but no evidence has been presented to the court to indicate into which commission category these orders would have fallen absent the alleged sur-commission agreement. If the filters for which Pall mistakenly paid a commission of only 12.5% were in the category for which there would have ordinarily been a 10% commission, then the accounting mistake to which Rapone referred would be the mistake of paying only 2.5% as a special commission, instead of 5%. If this were the case, the Rapone memorandum would confirm that a 5% special commission was to be paid on all nuclear filters, just as alleged by Abernathy.
If, on the other hand, the filters for which Pall mistakenly paid a commission of only 12.5% were in the category of filters for which there would have ordinarily been a 12.5% commission, then the accounting mistake to which Rapone referred would be the mistake of paying no special commission instead, apparently, of paying a 2.5% special commission. Thus, the writings before the court are ambiguous as to whether there was, as Abernathy claims, a 5% special commission on all nuclear filters, or a 5% special commission on some, but a 2.5% commission on others.
Abernathy, however, makes an additional argument for taking the agreement out of the Statute of Frauds. On November 22, 1993, Prevatte, who owns a ten to twelve percent stake in Abernathy, (see Prevatte Dep. at 7), sent Pall's then-CEO Maurice Hardy a three-page letter in which he voiced a number of complaints regarding Pall's treatment of Abernathy. (Ellis Decl. of 9/27/99, Ex. B.) Among other things, Prevatte complained that:
We kept Nuclear cartridge inventory in our stock and were only given an extra 5% commission when the cartridges were shipped. When the customer ask [sic] for a shipment we had to returned [sic] the cartridges to Cortland [Pall's headquarters] before shipment to the Utility Company to create the illusion that the material was shipped direct from the factory. This could have effected [sic] shelf life as well as other nuclear certifications that were required by the NRC and the utility co that purchased the cartridges.
(Id. at 2.) Hardy wrote back with a one-page letter, which included the following paragraph:
You make a point about our nuclear cartridge handling that I take very seriously. Your concern about the nuclear cartridges in your stock not meeting NRC requirements in [sic] unfounded. The reason you were asked to return them to [Pall] prior to shipment to the utility was to carry out all necessary Quality Control inspections at [Pall] to assure complete compliance with all regulations and customer specifications.
(Id., Ex. C.) Abernathy argues that because Hardy responded to the charge about possible violation of NRC regulations, but remained silent regarding the amount of commission to be paid, Hardy's letter should be deemed an admission by silence that satisfies the writing requirement *613 of the Statute of Frauds. (Pl.'s Mem. Opp'n II, at 6.)
Abernathy cites no authority for the proposition that an admission by silence can constitute a writing sufficient to satisfy the Statute of Frauds. (See id.) There appears to be only one decision discussing New York law that suggests an admission by silence in a writing is sufficient to overcome a Statute of Frauds defense. In Hellenic Lines Ltd. v. Gulf Oil Corp., 340 F.2d 398 (2d Cir.1965), a shipping line sent a letter to a fuel oil supplier, in which the shipping line enclosed executed copies of a maritime fuel oil contract. The letter included a proviso that read: ""We are, of course, signing these contracts on the strength of our agreement that you would ship cargo per our ships with freights corresponding to the value of the fuel we would be purchasing from you."" Id. at 400 n. 1. Gulf Oil wrote back, stating: ""We wish to acknowledge receipt of five executed copies of our Marine Fuel Oil Contract for 1959.... We have notified our Traffic Department of this and they will be glad to cooperate to our mutual advantage."" Id. n. 2. Gulf Oil subsequently refused to perform the oral affreightment agreement alluded to in Hellenic's letter and raised New York's Statute of Frauds as a defense. The Second Circuit rejected the defense, holding that because Hellenic's reference to the alleged affreightment agreement would reasonably call for a reply if there had been no such agreement, Gulf Oil's subsequent letter accepting the fuel oil contracts without any disclaimer as to the affreightment agreement could constitute an admission by silence of the existence of the oral agreement. See id. at 401.
Hellenic Lines is not controlling here for three reasons. First and foremost, the Second Circuit ultimately found New York law, and hence New York's Statute of Frauds, to be inapplicable to the case, because the oral contract in question was maritime in nature and, thus, subject to federal maritime law. See id. at 402. Second, unlike the plaintiff's letter in Hellenic Lines, Prevatte's letter did not reasonably call for a reply under the circumstances. The Prevatte letter must be seen for what it is: a laundry list of complaints by an obviously disgruntled former distributor who, in his opinion, had been wrongfully terminated.[19] As such, the letter did not call for any reply at all, and no adverse inference can be drawn against Pall for declining to answer some of the charges in the letter, including those relating to the alleged oral commissions agreement. Finally, the timing of Prevatte's letter further distinguishes it from that in Hellenic Lines. The letter in Hellenic Lines was sent contemporaneously with the execution of the fuel oil contracts to which Hellenic claimed the oral affreightment contract was linked. In contrast, the Prevatte letter was sent seven months after the dispute with Pall over the commissions erupted, thus raising the specter that Prevatte's statement regarding the amount of commissions due was self-serving. Absent any other pertinent authority in support, Abernathy's admission-by-silence argument must be rejected.[20]
*614 Abernathy's response to Pall's Statute of Frauds defense, therefore, stands or falls on the strength of the Rapone memorandum and the related correspondence from April of 1993 that Abernathy has produced. Because of the ambiguity as to the commission rate discussed above, these writings do not show with reasonable definiteness and certainty all the essential terms of the oral agreement alleged by Abernathy. Nonetheless, granting summary judgment in favor of Pall on Statute of Frauds grounds would be premature at this point, for it appears that the ambiguity could be resolved through minimal additional discovery. The Rapone memorandum lists the part numbers for each of the lots of nuclear filters in question. Pall presumably has business records that will establish into which of the categories listed in Appendix D of the Agreement the filters in question fall. Such records, when read in conjunction with the Agreement and the Rapone memorandum, should establish the precise terms of the oral commissions agreement.
Accordingly, in light of the facts that (1) there is substantial evidence that some type of commissions agreement existed along the lines alleged by Abernathy Ã Â¹Â viz., the April 1993 correspondence between Pall and Abernathy, and Festa's admissions that Abernathy did store nuclear filters for Pall and that it was ""possible"" that Pall paid Abernathy extra commissions in return for this service, and (2) the ambiguity as to the commission rate appears to be one that can be resolved without resort to parol evidence, Pall's Statute of Frauds defense is provisionally rejected, and Abernathy will be permitted to take additional discovery on the limited issue of the identity of the filters for which part numbers are listed in the Rapone memorandum. When this additional discovery is completed, Pall may renew its motion for summary judgment if the evidence produced thereby fails to resolve the ambiguity in favor of Abernathy's claim of an across-the-board five percent commission rate.

ii. Statute of Limitations
Pall argues in the alternative that Abernathy's commissions claim is time-barred. The statute of limitations on contract actions in New York is six years. See N.Y. C.P.L.R. Ã Â¸Â 213(2) (McKinney 1990). Pall argues that since Abernathy took delivery of the nuclear filters between 1987 and 1990, but did not raise its claim for unpaid commissions until it filed its Reply to Pall's counterclaims on February 11, 1998, Abernathy's claim is untimely. Leaving aside Abernathy's argument that the claim should relate back to its original Complaint filed on March 7, 1996,[21] the crucial flaw in Pall's argument is that there is no evidence before the court as to when the commissions actually accrued, and, hence, when the statute of limitations began to run.
According to Abernathy, the commissions did not become payable when Pall shipped the filters to Abernathy, but rather when Abernathy shipped the filters back to Pall for sale to a customer. Correspondence from Pall to Abernathy appears to establish this term of the agreement. Specifically, the Rapone memorandum of April 8, 1993, indicates that commissions *615 were not paid on certain lots of inventory because there were ""[n]o bookings on any subsequent orders by Duke [Power],"" which was apparently the target customer for the nuclear filters. (Everts Aff., Ex. A, Memorandum from Rapone to Ellis of 4/8/93, at 1.) There is, however, no evidence before the court as to the sales dates of those filters that were sold to the customer, and, hence, no evidence as to when the commissions became payable. Since the statute of limitations is an affirmative defense under New York law, see N.Y. C.P.L.R. Ã Â¸Â 3018(b) (McKinney 1991), Pall bears the burden of proof on the issue of timeliness and, thus, must suffer the consequences of the lack of evidence on the issue. Pall's motion for summary judgment on the ground that Abernathy's special commissions claim is barred by the statute of limitations, is denied.

b. Abernathy's Motion for Summary Judgment
Abernathy's motion for summary judgment on its commissions claim must be rejected, for even if one leaves aside Pall's Statute of Frauds defense, Abernathy has not shown that there is no genuine issue of fact on the question of whether it is owed commissions in the amount of $62,867. Abernathy's proof of the amount it is allegedly owed consists exclusively of the following: Jim Ellis declares that, after reviewing Abernathy's financial records, ""it [came] to [his] attention that Pall had paid $5,000 of the[] [special] commissions."" (Ellis Decl. II, Ã Â¸Â 22.) Abernathy then multiplies the dollar value of all nuclear filter inventory it allegedly stored pursuant to the agreement, viz., $1,357,346, by five percent, to get $67,867. (Pl.'s Mem. Supp. at 15.) Abernathy then subtracts the $5,000 payment from this latter figure to reach the claimed amount of $62,867. (Id.)
In response, Pall has raised a genuine issue of material fact as to whether any of the claimed $62,867 was, or is still, owed. (See Def.'s Mem. Opp'n at 5-6.) Specifically, the very same Pall memoranda from April of 1993 that Abernathy relies upon to meet the Statute of Frauds purport to show that all commissions that were due Abernathy on nuclear filters were paid. The memoranda list the various lots of nuclear filters received by Abernathy and then go on to state that the additional commissions were either already paid, not paid because the customer never ordered the filters, or paid in the wrong amount. (See Ellis Decl. II, Exs. 9-11.) By Pall's final calculation, recited in Rapone's letter to Ellis of April 19, 1993, only $4,745.56 was left owing to Abernathy on nuclear filter commissions. (See id., Ex. 10, at 2.) In none of its motion papers does Abernathy undertake to specifically refute any of these calculations.
Viewing this evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party Ã Â¹Â in this instance, Pall, a reasonable jury could find that Pall's calculations are accurate and that the $5,000 payment Ellis discovered in Abernathy's financial records was Pall's payment of its acknowledged debt of $4,745.56. Thus, on the evidence presented by Abernathy, a reasonable jury could find that Pall owes Abernathy nothing on the oral commissions agreement. Accordingly, a genuine issue of material fact exists with respect to the amount owed on the contract, and Abernathy's motion for summary judgment on its special commissions claim is, therefore, denied.

c. Legality
There is a latent issue as to the legality of the oral commissions agreement, which, for reasons one can easily surmise, was not raised by either party, but which should at least be acknowledged. As described by Abernathy, the object of the agreement was to facilitate a scheme by Pall to mislead its shareholders, a scheme which, in turn, may have run afoul of the spirit, if not the letter, of certain nuclear power safety regulations. The agreement would, therefore, appear to involve an unlawful goal and, hence, be unenforceable under New York law. See 22 N.Y. Jur.2d Contracts Ã Â¸Â 162 (1996) (""A party may not successfully *616 attempt to enforce or defend upon a contract or part of a contract which is illegal under the laws of the State or of the United States.... Moreover, the courts will not be overzealous to enforce a contract the effect of which would be to weaken the effectiveness of a regulation designed for the protection of human life or property.""); see also id. Ã Â¸Â 195, at 233 (""Any ... agreement designed or intended to accomplish the furtherance or effectuation of an unlawful purpose is unlawful, and every such ... agreement is void and unenforceable."").
Nonetheless, I will not make a sua sponte determination that the alleged special commissions agreement was unlawful for three reasons. First, whether an arrangement such as that alleged by Abernathy constitutes a violation of federal securities laws will often present complex issues of law and fact that should not be resolved without the benefit of briefing and discovery by the parties. Second, it is impossible for the court to determine on the current record whether the arrangement violated or skirted nuclear power safety regulations given that neither of the parties has identified the regulations in question.
Finally, even if the alleged agreement is illegal, it would probably still be enforceable under the circumstances of this case. There is New York case law to the effect that where there has been part performance of an illegal contract and the performing party entered the contract under duress or undue influence, relief may be granted. See id. Ã Â¸ÂÃ Â¸Â 201, 208. This principle is akin to the equitable principle that where two parties are not entirely in pari delicto, the unclean hands doctrine will not bar relief in favor of the less culpable party. See 55 N.Y. Jur.2d Equity Ã Â¸Â 121 (1986). Here, Jim Ellis testified that, despite the potentially unlawful purpose of the contract, Abernathy had ""no choice"" but to agree to it in light of the economic power Pall wielded over Abernathy. (Ellis Dep. at 284-85.)
Accordingly, in the absence of relevant briefing by the parties and in light of a substantial question of whether Abernathy is in pari delicto with Pall, the court will not sua sponte address the issue of the legality of the oral commissions agreement.

(6)
In the course of briefing on the instant motions, Pall withdrew its counterclaim for breach of contract and a debt owed. (Weller Affirm. of 9/14/99, Ex. A, Stipulation of Voluntary Dismissal.) Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment on defendant's counterclaim is, therefore, denied as moot.

Conclusion
For the foregoing reasons:
(1) Defendant's motion for summary judgment is granted on all claims except plaintiff's causes of action for (a) misuse of proprietary information and unfair competition, and (b) plaintiff's special commissions claim;
(2) plaintiff's cross-motion for partial summary judgment is denied; and
(3) the parties are granted leave to take additional discovery on the limited issues of (a) the extent of plaintiff's damages stemming from the alleged misuse of proprietary information, if any, and (b) what types of nuclear filters are designated by the part numbers listed in the Pall memoranda that plaintiff has submitted in satisfaction of the Statute of Frauds. Dated: Brooklyn, New York
SO ORDERED.
NOTES
[1]  As the terms ""distributor"" and ""sales representative"" are used by the parties, a sales representative markets and sells products to the customer, while a distributor stores and ships the product. (Festa Dep. at 42.)
[2]  Pall sells its various product lines through separately incorporated subsidiaries. Pall's practice is to have its distributors sign separate distribution and/or sales representative agreements with each of its subsidiaries. Because the distributor agreements and sales representative agreements with each of the subsidiaries are identically worded, (see Ortego Affirm., Exs. C, D), the various distribution agreements will be referred to collectively as ""the Exclusive Distribution Agreement"" or the ""Agreement,"" and the various sales representative agreements will be referred to collectively as ""the Sales Representative Agreement.""
[3]  Pall desired for its distributors to achieve a 20% increase in sales each year. (Rapone Dep. at 202-04; Ortego Affirm., Ex. T, Letter from Pall to Abernathy of 6/4/91, at 2 (""Abernathy-Thomas Engineering Co. is an essential factor in our meeting the growth target of 20% per year. We need your commitment and leadership to succeed."").) Abernathy's sales of Pall products, however, decreased by 11.5% in fiscal year 1988 (i.e., August 1988 through July 1989), by 13.9% in fiscal year 1989, and despite a 27% rebound in fiscal year 1990, decreased by 23.1% in fiscal year 1991. (Ellis Dep. at 209-10; Ortego Affirm., Exs. R-V, X.) In fiscal year 1992, Abernathy had a second rebound in Pall sales of 24.3%, but in the first quarter of fiscal year 1993 (i.e., just before Abernathy's termination) Abernathy's sales of Pall products decreased by 17%. (Ortego Affirm., Exs. W, X.)
[4]  ISO 9002 is a ""total quality management"" (""TQM"") standard for sales organizations. (Ellis Dep. at 184; Festa Dep. at 58-59; Ortego Affirm., Ex. K.)
[5]  It is not clear whether Roger Ellis was hired before or after Renew in '92. Although Jim Ellis's deposition testimony implies that Roger was hired in reliance on the Renew in '92 remarks, (Ellis Dep. at 99), Abernathy's Deryl Prevatte testified in deposition that Roger Ellis was already employed at Abernathy and that he was merely reassigned to the position of Pall Product Manager, (Prevatte Dep. at 88).
[6]  In its briefs, Pall appears to assume that Abernathy is claiming that its acts in reliance encompassed all the criteria set forth in the Festa Memo. (See Def.'s Mem. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. at 7-9 [hereinafter Def.'s Mem. Supp. I].) Pall's assumption appears to rest on the fact that, in a section of Abernathy's opposition brief discussing its fraud claims, Abernathy's counsel quotes the requirements outlined in the Festa Memo and then argues that Abernathy met each of those requirements. (See Pl.'s Mem. Opp'n Def.'s Mot. Summ. J. Ã Â¸Â I(b) [hereinafter Pl.'s Mem. Opp'n I].) Even if Abernathy's argument is so construed, argument of counsel is not admissible evidence. The summary given above of Abernathy's alleged acts in reliance is, therefore, limited to the acts that Abernathy's management actually testified were taken in reliance. When asked whether there were any acts taken in reliance on Renew in '92 or the Festa Memo besides the three discussed above, Abernathy's Jim Ellis answered: ""I don't recall specifically outside of what I already stated."" (Ellis Dep. at 79.)
[7]  If, as Abernathy's Deryl Prevatte testified, Roger Ellis was already employed by Abernathy before Renew in '92, see supra note 5, and Abernathy's ISO 9002 training was to be provided by Pall at a discounted cost, (Ortego Affirm., Ex. K, at 4), it is difficult to understand on what basis Ellis arrives at this $200,000 figure. The only remaining act supposedly taken in reliance on the remarks made at Renew in '92 and in the Festa Memo was Abernathy's review of whether it already met the other requirements specified in the Festa Memo. (See Ellis Dep. at 78). Presumably, the time and effort involved in that review could not reasonably be valued at $200,000.
[8]  Both Festa and Rapone testified that they did not recall this meeting or conversation. (Festa Dep. at 67; Rapone Dep. at 67.) Since, on summary judgment, all ambiguities must be resolved, and all factual inferences drawn, in the non-moving party's favor, see Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. at 255, 106 S. Ct. at 2513; Ward, 207 F.3d at 119, it will be assumed that the conversation did take place as described by Abernathy's Prevatte.
[9]  Under the terms of the Exclusive Distribution Agreement, Pall was at liberty to do so:

In the event of termination hereof by either party, the Company shall have the right to appoint a new Distributor. The appointment may be made immediately after the Company submits or receives a notice of termination and shall be effective as of the effective date of termination.
(Ortego Affirm., Ex. C, Ã Â¸Â VIII(b).)
[10]  It should be noted that Abernathy was without a supplier of filtration products for only two months. In May of 1992, Abernathy entered into an exclusive distribution agreement with a Pall competitor, Meissner Filtration Products, Inc. (""Meissner""). (Ellis Dep. at 12-13; Letter from Plaintiff's Counsel to Chambers of 5/16/00.) Interestingly, Meissner subsequently also terminated Abernathy in part of its sales territory because of poor sales performance. (Ellis Dep. at 13-16.)
[11]  Notably, Roger Ellis Ã Â¹Â the former Pall Product Manager Ã Â¹Â was not laid off. (Ellis Dep. at 218.) This fact tends to undermine Jim Ellis's testimony that Abernathy specially hired his son to meet the requirements for the two-year contract with Pall. (See id. at 99.)
[12]  The court has not been able to identify the regulation to which the parties refer.
[13]  The original, printed language recited that Clark had been specifically told ""between May and July, 1992 that the decision had been made to terminate Pall's relationship with Abernathy."" (Clark Decl. Ã Â¸Â 3.)
[14]  In its papers, Abernathy does not appear to be arguing that Festa and Rapone's alleged misrepresentations at the September 23rd meeting with Prevatte concerning Pall's level of satisfaction with Abernathy's performance constituted an independent act of fraudulent misrepresentation (as opposed to fraudulent concealment). However, to the extent that Abernathy does intend to make this claim, it too fails to survive summary judgment. Three weeks after the September 23rd meeting, Rapone disclosed to Ellis that Pall was in fact unhappy with Abernathy's performance and recited a litany of complaints to Ellis. (See Ellis Dep. at 156-59.) Any claim of damages because of the intervening three weeks of deception would be grossly speculative and, thus, would not permit recovery for the same reasons discussed above.

Moreover, Ellis's testimony that he could not recall taking any steps to address the concerns expressed by Rapone and his failure to allege that he or anyone else at Abernathy discussed Rapone's disclosure with Abernathy's other principals belies the notion that Abernathy would have acted any differently had Festa and Rapone disclosed Pall's concerns at the September meeting with Prevatte rather than three weeks later. The causation element of a fraudulent misrepresentation claim based on the September 23rd meeting would have to be predicated on such a finding. For this reason too, then, any fraudulent misrepresentation claim based on the September 23rd meeting would fail to present an issue for the jury.
[15]  When questioned whether there had been any oral or written modification of the Agreement with respect to confidentiality, Ellis testified as follows:

Q Do you recall any specific discussion where Pall personnel said that they would maintain the information about the customers on a confidential basis?
A No. We had no reason to doubt that they would do otherwise.
Q And do you recall ever seeing any documents other letters or memos in which Pall personnel assured you that they would maintain customer information in a confidential fashion?
A No, I don't recall any correspondence on that.
(Ellis Dep. at 114-115; see also Prevatte Dep. at 24, 48 (stating that Abernathy had never asked Pall to keep its customer information confidential and that Pall never promised that the information would not be shared with another distributor).)
[16]  It should be noted that the commission schedule on which Fluid Flow operated after Abernathy's termination paid slightly lower commissions that those Abernathy had been paid on high dollar value sales of certain types of filters. (Compare Ortego Affirm., Ex. C, Exclusive Distribution Agreement Between Pall Trinity Micro and Abernathy, App. D, with Exclusive Distribution Agreement Between Pall Trinity Micro and Fluid Flow, App. D, attached as exhibit to Letter from Defendant's Counsel to Chambers of 5/8/00.) However, because no evidence has been presented to the court regarding the volume of such high dollar value orders placed by consumers of Pall products in the Territory, it is impossible to assess whether the small differences between the two commission schedules led to a material reduction in Pall's overall distribution costs and, hence, whether a desire to realize such a reduction in cost at Abernathy's expense was a motivating factor in Pall's decision to terminate Abernathy.

By way of illustration, whereas Pall's contract with Abernathy provided for a commission of $25,250 plus 2 1/2% of the amount over $500,000 on sales of ""Special Housings"" and ""Porous Metal Products"" valued between $500,001 and $1,000,000, the commission on the same type of order under the Pall-Fluid Flow contract is $24,250 plus 2 1/2% of the amount over $500,000, i.e., $1,000 less. (Id.) Thus, on a sale of $750,000 worth of porous metal products, Pall would have paid Abernathy a commission of $31,500, but would have paid Fluid Flow $30,500. In contrast to these relatively small differences, the Pall-Abernathy and Pall-Fluid Flow contracts provided identical commissions on all sales of ""Standard Disposable Cartridges/Housings"" and ""Nuclear-Style Elements,"" and on sales of special housings and porous metal products valued up to $100,000. (Id.)
[17]  Section VII of the Agreement, which governs direct sales by Pall to its distributors' customers, appears to reflect a recognition of Pall's duty not to use a distributor's customer information to the distributor's detriment. That provision allows Pall to make direct sales, but only on the condition that Pall pay the distributor the same commission to which it would have been entitled had the distributor negotiated the sale itself. (See Ortego Affirm., Ex. C, Ã Â¸Â VII(a),(d).)
[18]  As noted previously, Abernathy was without a supplier of industrial filters for two months. See supra note 10. One might, therefore, suppose that Abernathy could not have made industrial filter sales during that period anyway. On this supposition, Fluid Flow's activities during the two first months are irrelevant to damages calculation: without a supply of filtration products, Abernathy could not have made filter sales during that time and thus lost no sales. The catch is that Abernathy alleges that it had a stock of Pall merchandise on hand after the termination which it attempted to sell to its regular customers, only to find that Fluid Flow had beaten it to the sale. (See Tr. at 15.) If that is so, then Abernathy could have made filter sales during the two months following termination, although the amount of Pall inventory it possessed at that time will set an upper bound on Abernathy's potential recovery of lost profits for the two-month period immediately following the termination.
[19]  For instance, in the letter, Prevatte wrote: If Pall is so professional, why did they cancel the contract with my company without giving a reason for the cancellation? Why did Pall cancel with only the thirty days notice? ...

Pall should take a marketing survey of their Customers to determine what the customers think of Pall and their management.... I am not bitter, but I wanted you to know that I feel that we did all of the things that Pall wanted us to do and still got canceled. I don't think our cancellation was handled very professionally.
(Ellis Decl. of 9/27/99, Ex. B, at 2-3.)
[20]  The Hellenic Lines dictum cannot be taken as persuasive authority as to how New York courts would treat Abernathy's admission-by-silence argument. Hellenic Lines cited only two decisions in support of its dictum: an Oregon state law decision, and an earlier Second Circuit decision that ultimately relied on a pre-Erie Supreme Court decision. See Hellenic Lines, 340 F.2d at 401 (citing Willard Helburn Inc. v. Spiewak, 180 F.2d 480 (2d Cir.1950); Wieder v. Lorenz, 164 Or. 10, 99 P.2d 38 (1940)). Moreover, those decisions addressed the question of the admissibility of an admission by silence as a matter of evidentiary law; neither involved a Statute of Frauds defense.
[21]  Abernathy relies on a paragraph of its original Complaint that reads, in relevant part:

Pall promised Abernathy that in return for Abernathy purchase of the inventory, Abernathy would receive better margins on products sold.... [O]ver a period of time, because Pall had poor sales performances [sic], Pall shipped worthless inventory to Abernathy (such as in one instance $439,000 worth), which Abernathy would then turn around and have to return in the ""next fical [sic] year"" so that Pall ... used the $439,000 in inventory as a sales [sic] in one year, to make them look good in the fourth quarter end of the year period.

5347084,5507223,61859586,Brescia Construction Co. v. Walart Construction Co.,"Brescia Construction Company, Inc. v. Walart Construction Company, Inc., Impleaded with New Amsterdam Casualty Company","
Townley, J.
This action was brought to foreclose a mechanic's hen. The hen was discharged by the filing of the usual statutory bond of the defendant New Amsterdam Casualty Company. The amount due the plaintiff under the contract and for extra work was determined by arbitration and by a judgment entered upon the award. This judgment was held not binding on the surety as to the validity of the hen. (Matter of Brescia Const. Co. v. Walart Const. Co., 238 App. Div. 45; affd., 264 N. Y. 260, and Brescia Const. Co., Inc., v. Walart Const. Co., Inc., 238 App. Div. 360.) The case was thereafter tried, and on a further appeal to this court a retrial of the action was ordered (Brescia Const. Co. v. Walart Const. Co., 245 App. Div. 105) to enable the surety to offer proof in support of its claim that the hen was invalid. On the new trial the trial court found that the notice of hen did sufficiently comply with the statute. The surety has taken this appeal and raises that sole issue.
Section 9 of the Lien Law provides that the notice of hen shall state: “ 4. The labor performed or materials furnished and the agreed price or value thereof.” “ To make a good notice the statute must be substantiahy comphed with.” (Pascual v. Greenleaf Park Land Co., 245 N. Y. 294, 299.) The notice of hen that was offered in evidence read:
“ 8. The agreed price and value of said labor is $8,178.39.
*152“ 9. The agreed price and value of said materials is $3,312.26 which includes a balance of $1,400 on the original contract and $1,912.26 of which is for extra materials.
“ 10. The amount unpaid the lienor for such labor and materials including the extra work as aforesaid is the sum of $11,490.65.”
The proof establishes that the agreed price and value of the labor and materials was $18,788.20, that there was paid to the lienor $7,297.55, leaving an unpaid balance of $11,490.65. The true amount due is reached by a method of computation not prescribed by statute. The notice of lien does not explicitly state the agreed price or value of the labor performed or material furnished at the time of filing thereof in accordance with the rule in Mitchell v. Dunmore Realty Co. (126 App. Div. 829) which was stated by the court in its opinion at page 833 as follows: “ This plainly requires that the notice shall state the whole value of the labor and materials, as well as the amount remaining unpaid, and one requirement is as imperative as the other.”
In effect, this court has already indicated its view that the notice of lien in this case does not comply with the requirements of the statute. Mr. Justice Merrell wrote (supra, 238 App. Div. 360, 364): “ In short, the notice of lien has not stated the value of the labor performed and materials furnished, but merely has stated the amount unpaid as the whole value of the services performed and materials furnished.” He then said that this was a failure to comply with the requirements in Mitchell v. Dunmore Realty Co. (supra), and indicated that the lien was insufficient.
No precedents are called to our attention which would lead us to change the view expressed by this court at that time. The court below apparently relied upon Mahley v. German Bank (174 N. Y. 499). In that case, in so far as the court considered any issue like the present one, it was said that the “ statement that the value of the work was $341.25 after deducting the payments made on account thereof could be held a substantial compliance with the statute.” But the statement on the present notice of lien is not phrased even in the manner approved by the Court of Appeals in the Mahley case. Furthermore, in Toop v. Smith (181 N. Y. 283, 288) the Court of Appeals expressly limited the force of its decision in the Mahley case to the point decided, namely, that the notice of lien did not state the time when the first and last items of work were performed and materials delivered.
We conclude that the statement of price and value in the notice falls short of the statutory requirement, and the surety is discharged.
The judgment should be reversed,; with costs, and the complaint dismissed, with costs.

2237330,2237330,2086814,People v. Dooley,"The PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF ILLINOIS, Plaintiff-Appellee, v. JOCK A. DOOLEY, Defendant-Appellant","

  JUSTICE BOWMAN
 

  delivered the opinion of the court:
 

  Following a jury trial in the circuit court of Tazewell County, defendant, Jock A. Dooley, was found guilty of four counts of aggravated criminal sexual assault (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1989, ch. 38, par. 12 — 14(bXl)) and one count of aggravated criminal sexual abuse (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1989, ch. 38, par. 12 — 16(c)(1)). He was sentenced to consecutive prison terms of six years each on the sexual assault counts and a consecutive three-year term on the sexual abuse count. He contends on appeal that (1) the trial court erred in imposing five consecutive sentences, (2) his sentence was excessive, and (3) he was prejudiced at trial by the ineffective assistance of counsel.
 

  According to the bill of indictment charging defendant, two of the four counts of aggravated criminal sexual assault arose from an incident which occurred on March 24, 1989. The incident underlying the other two counts assertedly took place in November 1988. The count for criminal sexual abuse also related to November 1988. At the time of the alleged incidents, the complainant was a 12-year-old girl who lived at the defendant’s apartment with her mother, the defendant, and her younger half-brother. Defendant was the mother’s boyfriend. Additional facts will be recited as needed to resolve the issues.
 

  Defendant’s first contention is that the trial court erred in making all five of his sentences consecutive. Section 5 — 8—4(a) of the Unified Code of Corrections (Code) provides for consecutive sentences as follows:
 

  “When multiple sentences of imprisonment are imposed on a defendant at the same time, *** the sentences shall run concurrently or consecutively as determined by the court. *** The court shall not impose consecutive sentences for offenses which were committed as part of a single course of conduct during which there was no substantial change in the nature of the criminal objective, unless, one of the offenses for which defendant was convicted was a Class X or Class 1 felony and the defendant inflicted severe bodily injury, or where the defendant was convicted of a violation of Section 12 — 13 or 12 — 14 of the Criminal Code of 1961, in which event the court shall enter sentences to run consecutively. Sentences shall run concurrently unless otherwise specified by the court.” Ill. Rev. Stat. 1989, ch. 38, par. 1005 — 8— 4(a).
 

  It is acknowledged by defendant that, when section 12 — 13 and section 12 — 14 offenses are perpetrated as part of a single course of conduct involving a single criminal objective, the sentences must be consecutive. Thus, defendant concedes that the convictions arising from the March 24, 1989, incident require consecutive sentences. He further concedes that the convictions stemming from the November 1988 occurrence require consecutive sentences. Defendant points out, however, that the two groups of offenses were separated by several months and urges that they do not constitute a single course of conduct and, therefore, do not require all consecutive sentences. In essence, defendant argues that the two groups of consecutive sentences may run concurrently with each other. As correctly noted by defendant, the trial court expressed belief that it was statutorily required to impose consecutive sentences on all the charges against defendant. Defendant takes the position that the trial court misconstrued the controlling statute.
 

  We recently addressed the precise question at issue here in People v. Bole (1991), 223 Ill. App. 3d 247. Defendant in Bole pleaded guilty to three violations of section 12 — 13(aX3) (criminal sexual assault). Defendant had perpetrated the three offenses against the same victim but on three separate and distinct occasions. Nevertheless, the trial court found that defendant qualified for mandatory consecutive sentences under section 5 — 8—4(a). Defendant was given separate sentences for the three separate occasions, all to run consecutively. On appeal we reviewed the statute and found the pertinent language to be clear and unambiguous. We concluded that, by its plain meaning, the mandatory consecutive sentencing provision in section 5 — 8—4(a) was intended to apply only to situations where the relevant offenses occurred during a single course of conduct. Our conclusion was supported by the history of section 5 — 8— 4(a), which we examined in considerable detail.
 

  In Bole we discussed People v. Ewald (1991), 210 Ill. App. 3d 7, a case recently decided by our colleagues in the fourth district. Ewald held that section 5 — 8—4(a) mandates consecutive sentences where multiple offenses include section 12 — 13 or 12 — 14 violations, even if the offenses arose from distinctly separate courses of conduct. Ewald has been followed by the Appellate Court, Fifth District, in People v. Hough (1991), 221 Ill. App. 3d 447, 453-55, and People v. Haun (1991), 221 Ill. App. 3d 164,176-77.
 

  The Ewald case, which had only recently been decided, was acknowledged, but challenged, by the defendant in Bole. In the instant case, the State relies on Ewald. However, in Bole we specifically disagreed with, and declined to follow, the interpretation of section 5 — 8— 4(a) which was announced in Ewald and subsequently adopted in Hough and Haun. Defendant has not presented, and we have not become aware of, any sound reason to retreat from the position we reached in Bole. On the contrary, upon reexamining our opinion in Bole for purposes of deciding this case, we are confident that the reasoning we applied and the conclusion we reached there remain valid and vital. We therefore reaffirm that, where the offenses, or groups of offenses, were committed during separate and distinct courses of conduct, section 5— 8 — 4(a) requires consecutive sentences for the offenses within each individual course of conduct but not for the collective offenses from all courses of conduct.
 

  As we mentioned above, the trial court imposed consecutive sentences on all of defendant’s convictions because it believed section 5— 8 — 4(a) required such sentences. We have now construed the statute to mandate consecutive sentences only where single courses of conduct are involved. Accordingly, this matter must be remanded, and defendant must be resentenced in light of this construction. We observe, as we did in Bole, that, although defendant is not eligible for mandatory consecutive sentences for the separate causes of conduct, he still qualifies for consecutive terms under the exercise of the trial court’s discretion under section 5 — 8—4(b). Ill. Rev. Stat. 1989, ch. 38, par. 1005 — 8—4(b).
 

  Inasmuch as the matter of consecutive sentences must be remanded for reconsideration by the trial court, we decline to address defendant’s second contention, which asserts that the sentence he received was excessive.
 

  We turn now to defendant’s argument that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel because his trial attorney failed to timely disclose his alibi defense. During his direct examination at trial, defendant began to testify that he could not have sexually abused the complainant on March 24, 1989, as charged, since he was in Tennessee fishing at the time. The prosecutor interrupted this testimony and, in a sidebar, objected that the testimony was improper since the State had been given no notice of an alibi defense. The court directed that the defendant’s alibi testimony be stricken. Later in the trial, however, the court admitted testimony, given by Howard McClaskey, that he and defendant had left on a fishing trip shortly before midnight on the evening of March 23, 1989, and did not return until March 26. Defense counsel subsequently argued the alibi to the jury in closing argument.
 

  Defendant raised in his post-trial motion the issue of counsel’s failure to give notice of an alibi defense. During the hearing on the motion, defendant testified that eight or nine months before trial he had told his trial attorney that he had an alibi. It is uncontested that the record contains nothing to show that defense counsel gave notice of an alibi defense to the prosecution or the court prior to trial.
 

  Defendant stresses that counsel’s failure to give notice of an alibi defense put him in a position where he took the stand, testified, and denied the charges, but was unable to even mention, much less present documentary evidence, that he had an alibi. According to defendant, such an omission in his testimony was particularly prejudicial since a defendant would certainly be expected to emphasize his own alibi if he had one. Moreover, defendant insists, he was prejudiced not only with regard to the March charges but also the November charges in that, if he had been able to impeach half the charges against him, by implication he could have attacked the credibility of his accuser on the remaining charges. Defendant concludes that his trial counsel was sufficiently ineffective to warrant a new trial.
 

  In order to prevail on a claim that his sixth amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel has been denied, a defendant must prove (1) that his legal representation was seriously deficient and (2) that he was prejudiced by counsel’s deficient performance. (People v. Chandler (1989), 129 Ill. 2d 233, 242, citing Strickland v. Washington (1984), 466 U.S. 668, 687, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674, 693, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 2064.) A defendant can provide the necessary proof by showing that counsel’s errors were so critical that they deprived him of a fair trial, that is, a trial with a reliable result. (Chandler, 129 Ill. 2d at 242.) A defendant must affirmatively demonstrate that counsel’s errors actually had an adverse effect on the defense. (Strickland, 466 U.S. at 693, 80 L. Ed. 2d at 697, 104 S. Ct. at 2067.) Defendant can carry this burden by showing a reasonable probability that, absent the errors, a reasonable doubt as to his guilt would have existed. (Strickland, 466 U.S. at 695, 80 L. Ed. 2d at 698, 104 S. Ct. at 2068-69; People v. Bean (1990), 137 Ill. 2d 65, 130.) If an ineffective assistance claim can be disposed of on the ground that counsel’s conduct was not sufficiently prejudicial, that course should be followed rather than focusing on counsel’s deficiencies. (Strickland, 466 U.S. at 697, 80 L. Ed. 2d at 699, 104 S. Ct. at 2069; People v. Johnson (1989), 128 Ill. 2d 253, 271.) Upon review of the record in this case, we are of the opinion that defendant cannot make a showing of prejudice sufficient to sustain his claim.
 

  Defendant’s attack on his trial attorney’s performance is confined to the attorney’s failure to inform the State that he intended to present an alibi defense and to furnish to the State specific information as to the place where defendant claimed he was at the time of the alleged offense. These disclosures are required by Supreme Court Rule 413(d) (134 Ill. 2d R. 413(d)), and the failure to make them, absent a showing of good cause, is ground for excluding evidence of the alibi (People v. Partee (1987), 157 Ill. App. 3d 231, 253; People v. Braxton (1980), 81 Ill. App. 3d 808, 815). Defendant’s testimony that he had told his attorney about his alibi eight or nine months before trial was not contradicted. We conclude that defense counsel should have given notice of an alibi defense. This simple step would have assured that defendant could testify as to his own alibi. However, we cannot say that, merely because he did not testify, defendant received an unfair trial and, therefore, is entitled to a new trial.
 

  First of all, evidence of defendant’s alibi was placed before the jury. Howard McClaskey testified that he and defendant were in Tiptonville, Tennessee, fishing, on March 24, 1989, the date of one of the alleged offenses. The witness said he and defendant left between 11:30 p.m and midnight on March 23, 1989, and returned on March 26. This alibi testimony was argued to the jury during defense counsel’s closing argument. Defendant nowhere claims that his own testimony, or other evidence he might have presented, would have shown anything more than was revealed by McClaskey’s testimony or argued in closing argument. Therefore, while defendant’s testimony may have reinforced in the jurors’ minds that he was claiming he was not present when the offense occurred, that testimony would have been essentially cumulative.
 

  More significantly, by the end of the trial defendant’s purported alibi turned out to be not much of an alibi after all. During the State’s case complainant testified that defendant assaulted her on March 24, 1989. Howard McClaskey then testified that he and defendant were gone on a fishing trip on March 24. McClaskey also indicated that the trip took place on Easter weekend and that he and defendant left Thursday night because he had Good Friday off from work. During rebuttal the complainant agreed that defendant had, indeed, gone on a fishing trip around the time asserted by McClaskey. According to complainant, however, the sexual assault occurred before he left.
 

  Complainant explained that she had thought the incident occurred on a Friday but it must have been a Wednesday or a Thursday. When asked why she thought the incident had occurred on March 24, complainant responded that it had happened at a time when she did not have school the next day, and the 24th was a Friday. On cross-examination during rebuttal, complainant testified that the offenses occurred on the last day of school before Easter vacation. The trial judge took judicial notice that March 23, 1989, was a Thursday and March 24, 1989, was Good Friday.
 

  In the final analysis, complainant did not dispute that defendant was gone on March 24, 1989. Rather, she maintained that she had been assaulted before he left, whichever date that may have been. As a result, whether defendant was in Tennessee on March 24 was not significant in terms of defendant having an alibi. Complainant testified the March assaults occurred, not while defendant was in Tennessee, but before he left for Tennessee. Thus, defendant’s purported alibi did not place him elsewhere at the time of the March offenses and did not serve him well as an alibi.
 

  To summarize, in light of complainant’s rebuttal testimony, defendant’s asserted alibi was left with little viability. Consequently, the relevance of evidence concerning the alibi was questionable. Nevertheless, such evidence was, in fact, presented to the jury through Howard Mc-Claskey’s testimony. Had defendant testified regarding an alibi, his testimony would have been essentially the same as McClaskey’s and, thus, would have been cumulative. Too, the alibi went only to the March violations. It would not have helped defendant directly with regard to the November charges. Under these circumstances, we do not believe defendant has shown a reasonable probability that, if counsel had disclosed an alibi defense, and defendant had been allowed to testify as to that alibi, he could have created a reasonable doubt of his guilt. (See Strickland, 466 U.S. at 695, 80 L. Ed. 2d at 698, 104 S. Ct. at 2068-69.) Since we cannot find that defendant was seriously prejudiced, neither can we find that the result of his trial was unreliable. As deficiencies in trial counsel’s performance did not deprive defendant of a fair trial, a new trial is not warranted.
 

  Therefore, the verdict and judgment of conviction of the circuit court of Tazewell County are affirmed, the sentence is vacated, and the matter is remanded for resentencing.
 

  Affirmed in part; vacated in part and remanded.

  450 U.S. 248, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 1094-95, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981). Switch and Data concedes Johnson can establish a
  
   prima facie
  
  case of racial employment discrimination, and Johnson concedes Switch and Data can provide a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for terminating his employment. Thus, the only issue before us is whether Johnson presented evidence showing the reason for his firing — deficient performance — was pretextual.
 

  A plaintiff may show pretext either by directly persuading the court a discriminatory reason motivated the defendant, or by indirectly showing the employer’s proffered explanation is unworthy of credence.

  Here, the evidence established that Johnson was performing deficiently. He received several poor performance evaluations, and was then put on a 30-day probationary period. During the probationary period, Johnson’s supervisor devised an objective method to test his performance and productivity. When Johnson failed to perform at adequate levels, Switch and Data terminated his employment.
 

  To establish pretext, Johnson presented evidence showing that he received a merit-based pay raise, he was appointed to a lead designer position just three weeks before he was terminated, and a vice president of Switch and Data praised his work. None of this evidence raises a genuine issue of material fact. The merit-based pay raise Johnson received was long before his termination date and irrelevant to establish pretext. The appointment to a lead designer position was not a promotion and, therefore, does not establish Johnson was performing well. Finally, the praise from the company’s vice president was sent via e-mail to an entire group and does not establish Johnson performed well individually. Johnson is unable to create a genuine issue of material fact that Switch and Data’s reason for termination was pretext, and the district court did not err in granting summary judgment.
 

  AFFIRMED.

6819584,6923639,63911921,In re Hall,In re Hall,"
O’CoNNEll, Judge,
delivered the opinion of the court:
This is an appeal from a decision of the Board of Appeals of the United States Patent Office affirming the examiner’s action in rejecting *909claims 14 and 17 in appellants’ application for a patent relating to improvements in rotary buffing tools, claims 1 to 7, 12, 13, 15, and 16 having been allowed.
The appealed claims read as follows:
14. As a new article of manufacture an abrading element for a rotary abrading tool, tbe same consisting of a strip of cloth wound spirally about and continually receding from a center and forming a laminated ring having slots extending radially through the laminations.
17. As a new article of manufacture an abrading element for a rotary abrading tool, the same consisting of a strip of cloth wound spirally about and continually receding from a center and forming a laminated ring having slots extending radially through the laminations, said laminations being secured together by at least one row of stitching extending through the several thicknesses and disposed lengthwise of said strip.
In arriving at its decision herein, the Board of Appeals had before it for consideration appellants’ claims 14, 15, 16, and 17, all of which had been rejected by the examiner in view of the prior art disclosed by the patent to Levett, No. 1,404,620, issued January 24, 1922.
The single paragraph containing the decision of the examiner reads as follows:
It is believed that the appealed claims are so broadly drawn as to read on the reference. The [Levett] patent discloses a buffing wheel made up of a strip of cloth wound spirally about and continually receding from the center of the wheel ÃÂ¡s the layers pile up on each other forming a laminated ring haying slots extending radically through the laminations which is what these [appellant’s] claims call for. The slots in the fabric as set forth in the claims do not distinguish from the slots in the reference, particularly in view of the fact that no combination is called for by the claims which would make the exact location of the slots critical.
The Board of Appeals in disposing of the issue presented referred to the action of the examiner, and stated its conclusion and the reasons therefor as follows:
The examiner has rejected the claims on the ground that they do not patent-ably distinguish from the buffing discs shown by Levett and, apparently, also on the ground that since the claims define only the fabric element without a hub member, no attention need be given to the direction of the [s]lots as defined in the claims.
On consideration of the terms of the four claims, it is our conclusion that claims 14 and 17 fail to define by any terms distinction over Levett. Claims 15 and 16 are considered limited to a position of slot not anticipated by Levett and believed to be material and important in defining the subcombination even without positive inclusion of the hub member. The subcombination appears to be a proper and self-sufficient subject of invention.
The decision of the examiner is affirmed with' respect to claims 14 and 17, but is reversed with respect to claims 15 and 16.
The obvious error of the examiner in rejecting all four of appellants’ claims, and of the Board of Appeals in rejecting claims 14 *910and 17, is to be found in their respective failure to observe the distinction in the claims from the disclosure in Levett.
Their common error is disclosed in the statement in the examiner’s decision, supra, “as the layers pile up on each other forming a laminated ring having slots extending radially through the laminations.”
In the application upon which the claims are based, the slots are cut after the ring is wound and then button-hole stitched, which produces permanent slots “extending radially through the laminations.”
Furthermore, the patent to Levett does not disclose or suggest a laminated ring having slots extending radially through the lamina-tions.
Appellants’ application discloses rotary abrading tools of the class which employs a ring of abrading material about and secured to a hub.
The appealed claims relate to the ring.
This ring, according to the specification, is formed of a bias-cut strip of cloth being wound spirally on and about a drum to the required thickness, after which the laminated cloth ring is removed axially.
After winding, the convolutions of cloth are secured together by two rows of stitching extending through the several thicknesses and disposed lengthwise of the strip.
The cylindrical laminated ring thus formed is interlocked oi? buttoned about and secured to the hub, the hub being provided with a circumferential series of generally radial T-shaped lugs, each of which consists of a neck and a circumferentially elongated head having two oppositely extending projections.
To enable the ring to be securely interlocked or buttoned onto the hub, appellants’ application provides for a series of slots, the edges of which, to increase their durability, are “button-hole” stitched.
These slots, which are designed to receive the necks of the T-shaped lugs, are sufficiently long to admit passage of the lugs therethrough, when the slots are registered with the heads, by passing first one and then the other of the projections through the slot. When this movement is accomplished, the slot is turned out of registration with the heads so as to occupy a position oblique thereto, thus securely interlocking the ring and the hub.
As disclosed in its specification, the Levett invention relates to buffing or polishing wheels made of cotton or wool fabrics, leather, or other materials. The body of the buffing or polishing wheel is formed of a continuous bias-cut strip of cloth or other suitable material, and this strip is provided along its median portion with spaced openings, preferably of lozenge shape.
The strip is doubled up widthwise at the openings or cut-out portions to provide a median line or edge and members, the outer edges *911of which form the peripheral face of the wheel. The median line or edge is gathered and wound around a core or disk, and a string or cord is laid in the doubled-up portion at the median line or edge.
In the Levett patent, by having the openings or cut-out portions, the act of gathering the doubled-up continuous strip does not unduly increase the thickness of the body or cause puckering at the hub, and the openings or cut-out portions serve no other purpose. By the arrangement described the continuous strip is held in doubled-up and gathered position around the core in a number of superimposed layers by the string or cord, and the core is held between two disks connected with each other by rivets, bolts, stitches, or other suitable means.
For special purposes the continuous strip in the Levett patent is reinforced by the use of fibers, bristles, fine wires, or other filaments arranged one alongside the other on one or both faces of the strip, and the filaments are fastened into position by suitable means such, for instance, as rows of stitches, or glue, or cement at the median line. On doubling the strip the filaments are likewise doubled and the outer edges of the filaments, together with the outer edges of the members, form the peripheral face of the wheel.
The drawings in the Levett application show that these filaments overlie and cover the openings, thus closing them. The strip, with’ its openings thus closed, is wound around a core or disk and, as mentioned above, is doubled and gathered by a string along the median line.
The Board of Appeals, in passing on claims 14 and 17, rejected them on the ground that they fail to define, by any terms, distinction over Levett.
It will be observed from the facts hereinbefore stated that the idea or suggestion of interlocking or “buttoning” a cloth ring onto projections about the perimeter of a hub is wholly lacking in the Levett patent. When the strip is wound in the Levett patent, as appellants point out, the previously-formed openings are not matched up, nor do they coincide as they must do to provide radial openings entirely through the ring.
It appears from the Levett patent that when the bias-cut strip of cloth or other suitable material is doubled width-wise, as hereinbefore stated, the so-called “lozenge-shaped slots” do not appear as such in the patentee’s finished article. On the contrary, they apparently are not slots, but, as stated by the patentee, are notches. Be that as it may, the patentee does not disclose or suggest a structure comprising a laminated ring “having slots extending radially through the lamina-tions,” as called for by the appealed claims, and we think it is evident from his disclosure that he did not contemplate any such structure.
Claims 14 and 17, respectively, contain the limitation, “a laminated ring having slots extending radially through the laminations,” and *912claim 11 contains the additional limitation, “said laminations being secured together by at least one row of stitching extending through the several thicknesses and disposed lengthwise of said strip.”
The convolutions of applicants’ strip, after being wound to form a ring and before the “button-holes” are formed, are secured together by two rows of stitching extending through the several thicknesses. When subsequently the “bottom-holes” are formed, as pointed out by appellants, the several thicknesses cannot therefore shift and slide against one another, and the openings in the several thicknesses must remain in coincidence and continue to provide slots extending through the laminations.
There is no disclosure in the prior art which suggests any such arrangement or suggests a laminated ring having slots extending radially through the laminations, and we think invention is shown in the novel and useful structure defined by the appealed claims.
Moreover, the method of attaching the ring in the Levett patent is to place the several members of the ring about a central core, apply two disks to the ends of the core, and then connect the disks by rivets, bolts, stitches, or other suitable means. The convenience and simplicity of attaching and detaching the ring to the hub as disclosed by appellant’s claims 14 and 17 constitute an advance in the art which warrants the protection sought by these claims.
For the reasons stated, the decision of the Board of Appeals is reversed.

Hoffman, P.J.


         {¶1}   Defendant-appellant Christopher Montez Jones appeals his conviction and

sentence entered by the Richland County Court of Common Pleas in three separate

case numbers: 2004CR0207, 2004CR0267, and 2004CR0881. Plaintiff-appellee is the

State of Ohio.

                                   STATEMENT OF THE CASE1

         {¶2}   Appellant was convicted in three separate case numbers in the Richland

County Court of Common Pleas after entering pleas of guilty to the charges therein. In

Case No. 2004CR0207, Appellant entered a plea of guilty to one count of forgery, a fifth

degree felony, in violation of R.C. Section 2913.31(A)(3). In Case No. 2004CR0267,

Appellant entered a plea of guilty to one count of grand theft of a motor vehicle, a fourth

degree felony, in violation of R.C. 2913.02(A)(1); one count of forgery, a fourth degree

felony, in violation of R.C. 2913.31(A)(2); and one count of identity fraud, a third degree

felony, in violation of R.C. 2913.49(B)(2). In Case No. 2004CR0881, Appellant entered

a plea of guilty to one count of theft by deception, a fifth degree felony, in violation of

R.C. 2913.02(A)(3).

         {¶3}   Upon journalization of Appellant’s sentences in the above cases, the trial

court failed to properly memorialize the manner of conviction, that being Appellant’s

entering a plea of guilty to the charges.

         {¶4}   On May 21, 2010, Appellant moved the trial court to revise/correct his

sentencing entries to comply with Criminal Rule 32(C) and State v. Baker, (2008), 119

Ohio St.3d 197, 2008-Ohio-3330 to include the manner of conviction.

1
    A rendition of the facts is unnecessary for our resolution of these appeals.
Richland County, Case No. 10CA75, 10CA76, and 10CA77                                    3


       {¶5}   On June 2, 2010, the trial court granted Appellant’s motion and issued

amended sentencing entries to comply with Criminal Rule 32(C) and the Supreme

Court’s holding in Baker.

       {¶6}   On June 17, 2010, Appellant filed a notice of appeal from the June 2, 2010

resentencing entries, assigning as error:

       {¶7}   “I. THE TRIAL COURT COMMITTED REVERSIBLE ERROR WHEN IT

DID NOT INFORM MR. JONES AT ALL OF POST-RELEASE CONTROL DURING THE

PLEA HEARING PRIOR TO ACCEPTING HIS PLEAS, THEREBY FAILING TO

SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLY WITH THE MAXIMUM PENALTY-COMPONENT OF

CRIM.R. 11(C)(2)(A).

       {¶8}   “II. MR. JONES WAS DENIED THE EFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF

COUNSEL       IN   VIOLATION     OF    THE     SIXTH    AMENDMENT         TO   THE   U.S.

CONSTITUTION AND ARTICLE I, SECTION 10 OF THE OHIO CONSTITUTION.”

                                                 I.

       {¶9}   As set forth in the Statement of the Case, above, the trial court granted

Appellant’s motion to revise/correct the sentencing entries finding the trial court’s

previous sentencing entries did not comply with Criminal Rule 32(C) and the Ohio

Supreme Court’s decision in State v. Baker (2008), 119 Ohio St.3d 197, 2008-Ohio-

3330. The Court in Baker held in the syllabus,

       {¶10} “A judgment of conviction is a final appealable order under R.C. 2505.02

when it sets forth (1) the guilty plea, the jury verdict, or the finding of the court upon

which the conviction is based; (2) the sentence; (3) the signature of the judge; and (4)

entry on the journal by the clerk of court. (Crim.R.32(C), explained.)”
Richland County, Case No. 10CA75, 10CA76, and 10CA77                                      4


        {¶11} Accordingly, Appellant’s sentencing entries were not final and appealable

until June 2, 2010 when the trial court corrected the entries to comply with Criminal Rule

32. Therefore, Appellant’s direct appeal is timely and properly before this Court.

        {¶12} In his first assignment of error, Appellant maintains the trial court erred in

failing to inform him of a term of post-release control during the plea hearing prior to

accepting his plea; thereby, failing to comply with Criminal Rule 11 (C)(2).

        {¶13} In State v. Sarkozy, (2008), 117 Ohio St.3d 86, the Ohio Supreme Court

held,

        {¶14} “Accordingly, we hold that if a trial court fails during a plea colloquy to

advise a defendant that the sentence will include a mandatory term of postrelease

control, the defendant may dispute the knowing, intelligent, and voluntary nature of the

plea either by filing a motion to withdraw the plea or upon direct appeal. Further, we

hold that if the trial court fails during the plea colloquy to advise a defendant that the

sentence will include a mandatory term of postrelease control, the court fails to comply

with Crim.R. 11 and the reviewing court must vacate the plea and remand the cause.”

        {¶15} In State v. Holmes, Licking App. No. 09 CA 70, 2010-Ohio-428, this Court

held:

        {¶16} “Appellant herein maintains that the trial court's notification, following

appellant's plea, that he would be placed on three years of PRC was insufficient in light

of State v. Sarkozy, 117 Ohio St.3d 86, 881 N.E.2d 1224, 2008-Ohio-509. In Sarkozy,

the Ohio Supreme Court held: ‘If the trial court fails during the plea colloquy to advise a

defendant that the sentence will include a mandatory term of postrelease control, the
Richland County, Case No. 10CA75, 10CA76, and 10CA77                                      5


court fails to comply with Crim.R. 11 and the reviewing court must vacate the plea and

remand the cause.’ Id. at paragraph two of the syllabus.

       {¶17} “Crim.R. 11(C)(2) details the trial court's duty in a felony plea hearing to

address the defendant personally and to convey certain information to such defendant,

and makes clear that the trial court shall not accept a plea of guilty or no contest without

performing these duties. As such, the PRC notification must be made prior to the court's

acceptance of the plea. See Sarkozy at ¶ 11, ¶ 25, 881 N.E.2d 1224. Moreover, ‘[e]ven

if post-release control is discretionary, a defendant must be informed of the possibility of

post-release control before a court may accept his plea.’ State v. Souris, Summit

App.No. 24550, 2009-Ohio-3562, ¶ 7.

       {¶18} “***

       {¶19} “Because this case represents a complete absence of PRC colloquy prior

to the court's acceptance of the plea, [footnote omitted] we find a lack of substantial

compliance with Crim.R. 11(C) and a demonstration of prejudicial error under Sarkozy

and its progeny.”

       {¶20} In the case sub judice, the trial court was required to inform Appellant of

the possibility of any mandatory or discretionary terms of post-release control as part of

the maximum penalty involved in order to satisfy Criminal Rule 11(C)(2)(a). Therefore,

in order for Appellant to knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily enter a plea, the trial

court was required to inform Appellant a post-release control sanction was a possibility

for the offenses to which he was pleading before the trial court accepted his plea. State

v. Douglas 2006-Ohio-536.
Richland County, Case No. 10CA75, 10CA76, and 10CA77                                   6


       {¶21} The trial court did not inform Appellant of the possibility of post-release

control prior to accepting his plea; therefore, Appellant’s plea was not made knowingly,

intelligently and voluntarily.

       {¶22} Appellant’s assigned error is sustained.         Appellant’s convictions and

sentences are reversed and the cases are remanded to the trial court for further

proceedings in accordance with the law and this opinion.

                                              II.

       {¶23} In the second assignment of error, Appellant asserts he was denied the

effective assistance of counsel as his trial counsel failed to ensure he was aware of and

understood the maximum penalty also included post-release control prior to his entering

his pleas.

       {¶24} Based upon our analysis and disposition of Appellant’s first assignment of

error, we find Appellant’s second assignment of error moot.

"
7777897,7835204,64840544,T.P. v. State,T.P. v. STATE of Alabama,"
WISE, Judge.
The appellant, T.P.,1 was convicted of one count of first-degree sexual abuse, a violation of § 13A-6-66, Ala.Code 1975. Because he had two prior felony convictions, he was sentenced as a habitual offender to life imprisonment.
The evidence presented at trial tended to establish that on July 18, 2002, Investigator Dean McGowan of the Baldwin County Sheriffs Department was contacted by the Baldwin County Department of Human Resources (“DHR”) concerning a suspected case of child sexual abuse. McGowan and Stephanie Buehler, a DHR social worker, interviewed eight-year-old B.P. (“the victim”). Buehler took the lead role during the interview; McGowan took notes during the interview but did not otherwise participate in interviewing the *1120victim. Also present during the interview was the victim’s mother.
During the interview, Buehler and the victim discussed “good touches” and “bad touches.” They also discussed which parts of the body were considered “private parts.” During this part of the discussion, Buehler showed the victim a book with drawings of a girl and a boy wearing bathing suits. Buehler explained that the areas under a bathing suit were considered to be “private parts” of the body. Buehler asked the victim if anyone had ever touched his private parts, to which the victim responded that his grandfather, T.P., had touched him on his buttocks. Further questioning established that on at least one occasion his grandfather had touched the victim’s buttocks through his clothing. On at least one other occasion, the victim told Buehler that his grandfather had taken him inside a camper, unfastened his pants, and placed his hands under his underwear on his bare buttocks. The victim stated that his grandfather told him not to tell his daddy — T.P.’s son— what had happened. The victim told Buehler the last time that his grandfather had touched his buttocks occurred just a few days before the interview.
Buehler and McGowan were advised that T.P. was a registered sexual offender who had been released from prison in January 2002 after completing a 10-year prison sentence for child sexual abuse. Following his release, T.P. returned to Baldwin County and lived next door to his son, the victim’s father. The victim’s parents were divorced and the victim lived with his mother; the father had scheduled visitation.
Later that day, McGowan interviewed T.P. at the sheriffs office in Robertsdale. McGowan explained to T.P. the nature of the investigation. He advised T.P. of his Miranda2 rights. T.P. indicated that he understood those rights; he thereafter elected to waive those rights and to be interviewed by McGowan. Initially, T.P. denied touching his grandson inappropriately. He implied that the allegations were the result of custody issues between the victim’s parents — his son and former daughter-in-law. Later in the interview, however, T.P. asked McGowan “what would happen to somebody if they committed the crime that he was being accused of.” (R. 30.) Eventually, T.P. told McGowan that he was going to tell him the truth. According to McGowan, T.P. said that the victim “liked to grab people on the penis and on the butt, and he said that [the victim] had done that to him.” (R. 30.) The victim’s actions made T.P. think that he “might be interested in having some kind of sexual contact with him.” (R. 30.) T.P. then told McGowan that when the victim came to see him at his camper he “fondled his butt cheeks on the outside of his clothes.” (R. 31.) A few days later, he said, he took the victim inside the bedroom of the camper, unbuttoned the victim’s pants, put his hands down the back of the victim’s underwear, and “played with his little hiney cheeks.” (R. 31.) T.P. agreed to give McGowan an audiotaped statement to this effect. Following T.P.’s audiotaped statement, McGowan arrested T.P. on a charge of first-degree sexual abuse.
At trial, Buehler and McGowan testified regarding their actions during the investigation. Although the State had planned to have the victim testify, it advised the circuit court that the victim would be unable to testify. After hearing expert testimony to the effect that forcing the victim to testify could result in emotional trauma to the victim, the circuit court determined that the victim was “unavailable to testify,” *1121and that his out-of-court statements to Buehler were admissible under § 15-25-32, Ala.Code 1975. Over the objection of defense counsel, Buehler was permitted to testify regarding the victim’s statements to her.3
Two other witnesses also testified— M.B.L. and L.A.B. Both witnesses testified that T.P. had at one time been married to their aunt. Both witnesses — who were adults at the time of this trial — testified that while they were children T.P. had sexually abused them. The circuit court instructed the jury that M.B.L. and L.A.B.’s testimony could not be considered as evidence of T.P.’s guilt in the present case. Instead, the court advised, the evidence was being offered in order to establish T.P.’s motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, or plan, or that the contact did not occur as a result of mistake or accident.
The defense presented no witnesses. At the close of all the evidence, the circuit court instructed the jury on the law applicable to T.P.’s case. The jury returned a verdict finding T.P. guilty of first-degree sexual abuse. This appeal followed.
T.P. argues that the circuit court committed reversible error in admitting the victim’s out-of-court statements into evidence because, he says, the requirements of § 15-25-32 were not met. Alternatively, T.P. argues that the recent United States Supreme Court decision in Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004), mandates that his conviction be reversed because, he says, the admission of this testimony violated his rights under the Confrontation Clause to the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution. Although Crawford was decided after T.P.’s trial occurred, its holding is nevertheless applicable to this case: “a new rule for the conduct of criminal prosecutions is to be applied retroactively to all cases, state or federal, pending on direct review or not yet final.... ” Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U.S. 314, 328, 107 S.Ct. 708, 93 L.Ed.2d 649 (1987).
In Crawford, the United States Supreme Court held that the admission of a wife’s out-of-court statements to police officers, regarding an incident in which the defendant, her husband, allegedly stabbed the victim, violated the Confrontation Clause. The Supreme Court stated that an out-of-court statement by a witness that is testimonial is barred under the Confrontation Clause, unless the witness is unavailable and the defendant had a prior opportunity to cross-examine the witness, regardless of whether the statement is deemed reliable by the trial court, abrogating its previous holding in Ohio v. Roberts, 448 U.S. 56, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 65 L.Ed.2d 597 (1980).
Although this Court has applied the holding in Crawford v. Washington, to nontestimonial hearsay, see, e.g., Perkins v. State, 897 So.2d 457 (Ala.Crim.App.2004); and Smith v. State, 898 So.2d 907 (Ala.Crim.App.2004), this is the first occasion we have had to address the holding in Crawford v. Washington as it applies to testimonial hearsay.
The Confrontation Clause, as contained in the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, provides: “In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to be confronted with the witnesses against him.” In Ohio v. Roberts, the United States Supreme Court *1122noted: “If one were to read this language literally, it would require, on objection, the exclusion of any statement made by a de-clarant not present at trial.... But, if thus applied, the Clause would abrogate virtually every hearsay exception, a result long rejected as unintended and too extreme.” 448 U.S. at 63, 100 S.Ct. 2531. Instead, the Court established a two-part analysis for determining whether certain testimony violated the Confrontation Clause; this analysis focused on the necessity and reliability of the testimony. The Roberts Court held that a hearsay statement satisfied the Sixth Amendment’s Confrontation Clause, despite a lack of face-to-face confrontation and cross-examination, so long as (1) the declarant is unavailable and (2) the hearsay statement “bears adequate ‘indicia of reliability.’” 448 U.S. at 66, 100 S.Ct. 2531. “Reliability can be inferred without more in a case where the evidence falls within a firmly rooted hearsay exception. In other cases, the evidence must be excluded, at least absent a showing of particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.” Id. Later decisions by the Supreme Court refined its holding in Ohio v. Roberts, appearing to reject the “unavailability” prong of that test. See White v. Illinois, 502 U.S. 346, 112 S.Ct. 736, 116 L.Ed.2d 848 (1992), and United States v. Inadi, 475 U.S. 387, 106 S.Ct. 1121, 89 L.Ed.2d 390 (1986). Nevertheless, this framework governed the interplay between hearsay and the Confrontation Clause, until the decision in Crawford v. Washington, which revisited the Court’s holding in Ohio v. Roberts. See, e.g., Lilly v. Virginia, 527 U.S. 116, 119 S.Ct. 1887, 144 L.Ed.2d 117 (1999); White v. Illinois, supra; Idaho v. Wright, 497 U.S. 805, 110 S.Ct. 3139, 111 L.Ed.2d 638 (1990). The framework required courts to identify and evaluate the factors that bore upon the reliability of a hearsay statement.
Alabama law authorizes the admission of an out-of-court statement made by a child under the age of 12 under certain circumstances. Section 15-25-31, Ala.Code 1975, provides:
“An out-of-court statement made by a child under 12 years of age at the time of the proceeding concerning an act that is a material element of any crime involving child physical offense, sexual offense, and exploitation, as defined in Section 15-25-39, which statement is not otherwise admissible in evidence, is admissible in evidence in criminal proceedings, if the requirements of Section 15-25-32 are met.”
Section 15-25-32 provides:
“An out-of-court statement may be admitted as provided in Section 15-25-31, if:
“(1) The child testifies at the proceeding, or testifies by means of video tape deposition as provided by Section 15-25-2, or testifies by means of closed circuit television as is provided in Section 15-25-3, and at the time of such testimony is subject to cross-examination about the out-of-court statements; or
“(2)a. The child is found by the court to be unavailable to testify on any of these grounds:
“1. The child’s death;
“2. The court finds that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the defendant or someone acting on behalf of the defendant has intentionally removed the child from the jurisdiction of the court;
“3. The child’s total failure of memory;
“4. The child’s physical or mental disability;
“5. The child’s incompetency, including the child’s inability to commu*1123nicate about the offense because of fear or a similar reason; or
“6. Substantial likelihood that the child would suffer severe emotional trauma from testifying at the proceeding or by means of closed circuit television; and
“b. The child’s out-of-court statement is shown to the reasonable satisfaction of the court to possess particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.”
The statutory hearsay exception created by § 15-25-31 was enacted to address the special problems inherent in cases involving the exploitation or physical or sexual abuse of children. In an attempt to ensure the constitutionality of the statute, the Legislature incorporated the Ohio v. Roberts framework into § 15-25-32(2), predicating the admissibility of a child’s out-of-court statement on a judicial determination of the child’s unavailability, together with a determination that the statement bears “particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.”
Unfortunately, the decision in Crawford v. Washington renders the Legislature’s attempt to satisfy the Ohio v. Roberts standard superfluous. With regard to the declarant, Crawford v. Washington requires both unavailability and an opportunity for cross-examination. Section 15-25-32(2) requires the declarant’s unavailability; however, the statute does not provide that the defendant have had an opportunity to cross-examine the declarant.
Although the Supreme Court held that Crawford applied to testimonial statements, it did not provide a comprehensive definition of testimonial statements, stating merely that “[wjhatever else the term covers, it applies at a minimum to prior testimony at a preliminary hearing, before a grand jury, or at a former trial; and to police interrogations.” 541 U.S. at 68, 124 S.Ct. at 1374. In the present case, B.P.’s statements were the result of an interview conducted by DHR social worker Stephanie Buehler and Investigator Dean McGowan, as part of a criminal investigation. Under these circumstances, we conclude — as have other jurisdictions — that because the interview was intended to be used as an investigative tool for a potential criminal prosecution, the interview is similar to a police interrogation and, thus, falls within the definition of “testimonial” contained in Crawford v. Washington. See People v. Sisavath, 118 Cal.App.4th 1396, 13 Cal.Rptr.3d 753 (2004) (statement of minor to interviewer at facility for child sexual-abuse victims was “testimonial” because it was made under circumstances that would lead witness to believe that the statement would be available for use at trial); Snowden v. State, 156 Md.App. 139, 846 A.2d 36 (2004) (statements of minors to social worker were “testimonial” because they were made for purpose of developing their testimony for trial).4 Therefore, B.P.’s statements to Buehler clearly fit within the scope of “testimonial” hearsay Crawford v. Washington holds is subject to the Confrontation Clause. Accordingly, the circuit court erred when it allowed Buehler to testify regarding B.P.’s statement that his grandfather touched his *1124private parts on several occasions.5 Having concluded that the circuit court erred in admitting Buehler’s testimony regarding B.P.’s statements, we must now determine whether this error warrants reversal. Rule 45, Ala.R.App.P., provides:
“No judgment may be reversed or set aside, nor new trial granted in any civil or criminal case on the ground of ... improper admission or rejection of evidence ... unless in the opinion of the court to which the appeal is taken or application is made, after an examination of the entire cause, it should appear that the error complained of has probably injuriously affected substantial rights of the parties.”
This Court has traditionally applied a harmless-error analysis to claims alleging a violation of the Confrontation Clause. See, e.g., Flowers v. State, 799 So.2d 966, 982 (Ala.Crim.App.2000) (quoting State v. Martinez, 99 N.M. 48, 52, 653 P.2d 879, 884 (Ct.App.1982)); Withee v. State, 728 So.2d 684, 688 (Ala.Crim.App.1998); Grantham v. State, 580 So.2d 53, 58 (Ala.Crim.App.1991).
In determining whether the error in this case was harmless, we first look to the Supreme Court’s opinion in Crawford v. Washington. In remanding that case to the Washington Supreme Court for further proceedings, it noted that the state appellate court had found the confrontation violation “not harmless.” 541 U.S. at 42 n. 1, 124 S.Ct. at 1359 n. 1. From this, we infer that while Crawford v. Washington fundamentally alters the way we analyze claims of error under the Confrontation Clause, the opinion does not change the way we evaluate the effect of any such error. Accordingly, we must now determine whether the constitutional violation in this case is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 24, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967); see also Perkins v. State, 897 So.2d at 465; Smith v. State, 898 So.2d at 918.6
Even without Buehler’s testimony that B.P. told her that T.P. had touched his private parts on several occasions, the evidence presented by the State was sufficient on which to base a finding that T.P. was guilty of first-degree sexual abuse. Indeed, the State offered evidence that T.P. himself admitted to Investigator McGowan that he had touched his grandson’s bare buttocks in an inappropriate manner.7
On appeal, T.P. does not challenge the voluntariness of his inculpatory statements. Instead, he states that “in the absence of B.P.’s statements, the State would have been unable to establish the corpus delicti of the charged offense, as a foundational prerequisite to the admission of [his] inculpatory statements.” This statement is incorrect.
*1125“It has been the rule in Alabama that the State must offer independent proof of the corpus delicti of the charged offense to authorize the admission of a defendant’s confession or inculpatory statement. Robinson v. State, 560 So.2d 1130, 1135-36 (Ala.Cr.App.1989); see C. Gamble, McElroy’s Alabama Evidence, 200.13 (5th ed.1996). ‘ “The corpus de-licti consists of two elements: ‘(1) That a certain result has been produced, ... and (2) that some person is criminally responsible for the act.’ ” Johnson v. State, 473 So.2d 607, 608 (Ala.Cr.App.1985),] (quoting C. Gamble, McElroy’s Alabama Evidence § 304.01 (3d ed.1977)).’ Spear v. State, 508 So.2d 306, 308 (Ala.Cr.App.1987). ‘ “Positive, direct evidence of the corpus delicti is not indispensable to the admissions of confessions.” ’ Bracewell v. State, 506 So.2d 354, 360 (Ala.Cr.App.1986), quoting Ryan v. State, 100 Ala. 94, 14 So. 868 (1894). ‘The corpus delicti may be established by circumstantial evidence.’ Sockwell v. State, 675 So.2d 4, 21 (Ala.Cr.App.1993), aff'd, 675 So.2d 38 (Ala.1995), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 838, 117 S.Ct. 115, 136 L.Ed.2d 67 (1996).”
Maxwell v. State, 828 So.2d 347, 357 (Ala.Crim.App.2000).
Here, Buehler testified, without objection, that B.P. told her someone had touched his private parts. Although hearsay, this testimony became legal evidence upon its receipt into evidence without objection. See Johnson v. State, 642 So.2d 528, 529-30 (Ala.Crim.App.1994) (hearsay evidence admitted without objection is lawful evidence). Moreover, the perpetrator’s identity is not required to establish the corpus delicti. See Bland v. State, 601 So.2d 521, 525 (Ala.Crim.App.), opinion after remand, 605 So.2d 849 (Ala.Crim.App.1992). Buehler’s testimony, together with State’s exhibits 3 and 4— drawings showing on what part of his body B.P. was touched which were also admitted without objection — and the testimony of M.B.L. and L.A.B. was sufficient to establish the corpus delicti. Thus, contrary to T.P.’s claim, proof of the corpus delicti was established independent of his inculpatory statements. Accordingly, T.P.’s statements were properly admitted into evidence. In light of the admission of T.P.’s unchallenged inculpatory statements to Investigator McGowan, the admission of Buehler’s hearsay testimony regarding the identity of B.P.’s abuser did not affect the outcome of the trial or otherwise prejudice T.P.’s right to a fair trial.
Based on the foregoing, the judgment of the circuit court is affirmed.
AFFIRMED.

. In addition to T.P.'s in-court objection, defense counsel also filed a written motion objecting to the admission of the victim's out-of-court statements to Buehler on the grounds (1) that the victim had not been found to be unavailable pursuant to § 15-25-32; and (2) that T.P. had a right to confront and cross-examine his accuser. (C. 26.)


. At least one jurisdiction has distinguished between statements made by minors to police officers or other government employees and those made to nongovernment employees. See People v. Geno, 261 Mich.App. 624, 630, 683 N.W.2d 687, 692 (2004) (statement made by child was not ""testimonial” because it was made to a nongovernment employee and was not a statement in the nature of "" ‘ex parte in-court testimony or its functional equivalent' ”). Because B.P.’s statements were made to government employees, this holding is irrelevant to the facts of this case.


. Because T.P. does not challenge the constitutional validity of § 15-25-32(2), we need not address the constitutionality of that statute.


. Following the release of Crawford v. Washington, other jurisdictions have likewise reviewed Confrontation Clause claims under a harmless-error standard. See, e.g., People v.

State, 132 S.W.3d 702 (Tex.Ct.App.2004).


.The appellant's motion for a judgment of acquittal based on the State's failure to prove a prima facie case of sexual abuse preserved the issue whether the State established the corpus delicti of sexual abuse because a confession or admission alone cannot support a conviction.

  ORDER
 

  MARY BECK BRISCOE, Circuit Judge.
 

  Defendant Lamont Williams, appearing pro se, seeks a certificate of appealability (COA) in order to challenge the district court’s denial of his motion to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255. Because Williams has failed to make “a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right,” 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(2), we deny his request and dismiss the appeal.
 

  On September 10, 1999, Williams was indicted, along with nine other defendants, for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and to distribute cocaine and cocaine base in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 846. The case proceeded to trial and Williams was found guilty as charged. On November 9, 2000, Williams was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 240 months. Williams filed a direct appeal challenging both his conviction and sentence. This court, in an unpublished decision, affirmed Williams’ conviction but remanded his case for resentencing on the grounds that the district court had erred in calculating the amount of drugs attributable to him.
  
   United States v. Williams,
  
  44 Fed.Appx. 362 (10th Cir.2002). Williams was resentenced on March 24, 2003, to 240 months’ imprisonment. Williams did not file an appeal from his resentencing.
 

  On September 24, 2004, Williams, appearing pro se, filed a motion seeking to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255. In his motion, Williams asserted that his sentence was invalid in light of the Supreme Court’s decision in
  
   Blakely v. Washington,
  
  542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). Williams also asserted that his trial counsel performed in a constitutionally ineffective manner during trial by failing to challenge testimony provided by government witness Shawn Alexander. Alexander testified at trial that cocaine was transported from California to Tulsa in a yellow Ford Mustang. Once in Tulsa, Alexander testified, the cocaine was removed from the Mustang and distributed to Williams and other co-defendants. In his § 2255 motion, Williams argued that his trial counsel failed to offer expert testimony or object to testimony offered by Alexander that he used a screwdriver to remove a panel on the Mustang.
  
   *
  


  On November 22, 2004, the district court issued an order denying Williams’ § 2255 motion. The district court rejected Williams’ Blakely-based attack on his sen
   
   *206
   
  tence, noting that the Supreme Court “did not hold that
  
   Blakely
  
  ha[d] retroactive application.” ROA, Yol. I, Doc. 634, at 6. As for Williams’ ineffective assistance claim, the district court, applying the standards for such claims outlined by the Supreme Court in
  
   Strickland v. Washington,
  
  466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), concluded that Williams had failed to establish that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to challenge Alexander’s testimony in the respect asserted by Williams. Although Williams subsequently sought a COA from the district court, the district court never acted on that request, and thus the request is deemed denied.
  
   See United States v. Kennedy,
  
  225 F.3d 1187, 1193 n. 3 (10th Cir.2000). Williams has now applied for a COA from this court.
 

  To be entitled to COA, Williams must make “a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.” 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(2). To make the requisite showing, Williams must demonstrate “that reasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.”
  
   Miller-El v. Cockrell,
  
  537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003) (quotations omitted).
 

  We find no basis for granting a COA with respect to Williams’
  
   Blakely
  
  claim. In
  
   United States v. Price,
  
  400 F.3d 844, 849 (10th Cir.2005), we held that
  
   “Blakely
  
  does not apply retroactively to convictions that were already final at the time the [Supreme] Court decided
  
   Blakely,
  
  June 24, 2004.” Here, Williams’ conviction and sentence were clearly final by that date, since he was resentenced on March 24, 2003, and chose not to appeal from that resentencing. Thus, neither
  
   Blakely,
  
  nor the Supreme Court’s more recent decision in
  
   United States v. Booker,
  
  — U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) (extending
  
   Blakely
  
  to the federal sentencing guidelines), apply retroactively to Williams’ case.
  
   See United States v. Bellamy,
  
  411 F.3d 1182, 1183 (10th Cir.2005) (concluding
  
   “Booker
  
  does not apply retroactively to initial habeas petitions”). Although Williams argues that his case is an exception because at the time of sentencing he asserted a claim based on
  
   Apprendi v. New Jersey,
  
  530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have held that
  
   Blakely
  
  “announced a new rule” of criminal procedure.
  
   Price,
  
  400 F.3d at 848. Thus, Williams’ assertion of an
  
   Apprendi
  
  claim at the time of sentencing does not preserve his current
  
   Blakely
  
  claim.
 

  We likewise conclude that Williams has failed to establish his entitlement to a COA with respect to his ineffective assistance of counsel claim. In particular, after reviewing the record on appeal, we agree with the district court that Williams has “fail[ed] to indicate how the use of any particular tool to remove cocaine from the [M]ustang, if investigated or proven, would have been exculpatory evidence as to the issue of whether cocaine was transported from California to Tulsa for delivery to Williams and other co-defendants.” ROA, Vol. I, Doc. 634, at 4. Thus, we find no basis for concluding that Williams’ ineffective assistance claim should have been resolved in a different manner.
 

  The request for a COA is DENIED and the appeal is DISMISSED. Appellant’s motion to proceed in forma pauperis is granted.
 


   *
  

   Williams' § 2255 motion included additional claims of ineffective assistance, but Williams has abandoned those claims on appeal.

The commissioner has done so in an opinion and report filed on October 26,1971, wherein such facts as are necessary to the opinion are set forth. Plaintiff filed a request for review of the commissioner’s opinion by *192tbe court and the case has been submitted to the court on oral argument of counsel and the briefs of the parties. Since the court agrees with the opinion and recommended conclusion of the trial commissioner, as hereinafter set forth, it hereby adopts the same as the basis for its judgment in this case. Accordingly, plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment in opposition to the decision of the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals in ASBCA Nos. 11849,11952,11955,12001, 12028, 12030 and 12031 is denied; defendant’s motion in support of the decision of the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals on the same appeals is granted; and, plaintiff’s petition is dismissed.
OPINION OP COMMISSIONER
Bat, Commissioner: This is a contract case which is before the court on plaintiff’s motion and defendant’s cross-motion for summary judgment under Buie 163(b) (1) and (2). Review is sought in accordance with the standards prescribed by the Wunderlich Act, 41 TJ.S.C. §§ 321, 322, of a decision of the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals.1 The Board denied a total of seven claims by the plaintiff arising from a contract between the plaintiff and the defendant. The responsible contracting agency was the Department of the Army, Sacramento District, Corps of Engineers, located at Sacramento, California. Plaintiff is a Nevada corporation with its principal place of business in Long Beach, California. In this court, plaintiff challenges the decision and findings of the Board as not supported by substantial evidence, as arbitrary and as erroneous as a matter of law.
Contract No. DA-04-167-ENG-3403, dated May 28,1964, was a fixed price construction contract2 for a total price of $599,300, awarded to plaintiff following competitive bidding. The plaintiff agreed to perform several separate items of *193construction work at Travis Air Force Base, California, all work to be completed by April 1, 1965. Final completion of the contract was successful, and is not in issue here. All of the contractor’s claims arise under Item No. 1 of the contract, entitled “Hydrant Fuel System.”
Item 1 essentially required plaintiff to convert an existing aircraft fuel pumphouse into a hydrant fuel pumphouse, including fixtures. Of primary importance for the issues presented in this case was a requirement that the 'contractor extend fuel feeder lines, totaling 6 in number, under the existing concrete apron of the airfield; and construct at several points along these lines hydrant stations that would permit aircraft to be fueled in place on their parking hardstands. In order to lay the fuel pipelines the contractor had to tear up (or “break out”) and remove from the apron 6 narrow strips of concrete, called “laterals.” The laterals were numbered sequentially from 1 to 6. In order to minimize interference with the operation of the airfield during performance of Item No. 1, the item was subdivided into three phases of work. Each phase consisted of (in addition to work not in issue) the construction of one pair of laterals. Thus phase 1 consisted of the breakout and excavation of laterals 5 and 6, construction of the hydrant valve boxes along these laterals, installation of fuel and electrical lines, backfilling of the trenches, pouring in of new concrete, and curing time for the concrete. Phase 2 included work on laterals 8 and 4; and completion of laterals 1 and 2 was included in phase 3. All work on each pair of laterals, including curing time, had to be completed before the contractor would 'be permitted to begin breakout on the laterals in the subsequent phase. The final completion date of Item No. 1 was to be October 1, 1964. Subsequent contract modifications extended this date to October 17, 1964, and increased the total contract price to $627,310. The contract provided for liquated damages in the amount of $150 per day for failure of the contractor to meet any intermediate completion date, including the Item No. 1 completion date. Since the contractor failed to complete Item No. 1 until November 20, 1964, the government deducted *194liquidated damages iu the amount of $5,100 from the contract price.
Three of the contractor’s claims involved the concrete breakout work under Item No. 1. ASB'CA Nos. 11849 and 11955 are claims for equitable adjustments and time extensions under the changes and suspension of work clauses. The contractor claims he was prevented from pursuing a method of breakout that was permissible under the specifications, and then permitted to use this method only under burdensome and costly restrictions. ASBCA 11952 involves the contractor’s claim that he was required to repair portions of the concrete taxiway not directly involved in the contract by a method more costly than the one contemplated by the specifications, even assuming (as he does not) that this work was his responsibility. In ASBCA 12031 the contractor claims an adjustment based on what he conceives to have been unjustified acceleration orders 'by the contracting officer. ASBCA 12001 is a claim for suspension of work clause adjustments based upon the late receipt of revised drawings needed to comply with certain change orders. ASBCA 12028 is a claim for remission of liquidated damages and ASBCA 12030 is a claim for impact damages, or a total cost recovery, based on the above-mentioned substantive claims. The contractor seeks $116,250 and an extension of 7 days under 11849; $5,948 and 14 days under 11955; $14,750 and 6 days under 11952; $8,853 and 8 days under 12001; $5,100 under 12028; $76,303 under 12031, and in the alternative, a total cost recovery of $222,615 for the claims numbered 11849, 11952,11955,12001 and 12031.
/. Standard of Review
At the threshold of this case, plaintiff makes the contention that this court shotdd apply a more stringent standard of review to the findings of fact of the Board than is usual in Wunderlich Act reviews. The hearing before the ASBCA was presided over by a hearing officer who did not subsequently participate in the consideration or decision of the appeals. The plaintiff does not argue that the rendering of *195the decision, by three members of the Board other than the hearing officer renders the decision a nullity. It is well-settled that “[t]here is no applicable rule stating that the board decision must be rendered by the individual who presided at the hearing,” and consequently the hearing officer’s participation in the decision is not required. Anthony P. Miller, Inc. v. United States, 161 Ct. Cl. 455, 474 n. 11, cert. denied, 375 U.S. 879 (1963). Instead plaintiff argues that the panel rendering the decision did not have the opportunity to observe the demeanor of the witnesses. Since the decision of the Board necessarily required it to discredit some or all of the testimony favorable to the plaintiff, plaintiff maintains that the findings of the Board are not merely unsupported by substantial evidence, they are also arbitrary. Therefore, plaintiff asks the court to carefully weigh the opposing evidence and in effect to require more than substantial evidence to support the findings of the Board.
This argument is without merit. In dealing with substantially similar contentions, this court has recently stated:
* * * It is the plaintiff’s position that the findings of fact made by the ASBCA are a nullity and without binding effect on this court since the presiding member of the Board neither wrote the Board’s decision, nor was he a party to it. This contention must be rejected for we recently stated that in the absence of a rule compelling the Board’s decision to be rendered by the presiding member there is no such requirement. * * * [Emphasis added.]
[Sundstrand Turbo v. United States, 182 Ct. Cl. 31, 38, 389 F. 2d 406, 410 (1968).]
Plaintiff presents no argument that the Board did not consider all the evidence presented to it. See Sternberger v. United States, 185 Ct. Cl. 528, 537, 401 F. 2d 1012, 1017 (1968). The Board’s decision and findings indicate a careful review of all the evidence. Nor does plaintiff argue that the record is incomplete or otherwise defective. Furthermore, in a case like the present one in which the evidence presented to the Board is of a technical nature, the utility of physical observation of the witnesses is marginal at best.
*196The standards of review in this court of the findings of fact in an administrative determination are not mere rules of convenience. Under Wunderlich Act criteria, administrative determinations in contract disputes of fact are conclusive and binding on this court unless the findings of fact are arbitrary, capricious or not supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole. The standard of substantial evidence goes to the reasonableness of what the agency did on the basis of the evidence before it. United States v. Carlo Bianchi & Co., 373 U.S. 709, 715 (1963).3
'Since the A'SBCA panel deciding this case was properly constituted, and the proceedings have not been shown to bo defective, there is no basis for departing from the substantial evidence criteria in evaluating the findings of fact of the Board.

II. The Claims for Concrete Breakout and Repair of the Adjacent Concrete

The laterals from which concrete was to be removed under Item No. 1 represented relatively narrow strips of a broad expanse of concrete apron. The proposed laterals were entirely confined by concrete except at one end of each lateral where the concrete ended and was bounded by soil or other nonrigid material. Each lateral trench was to be 5 feet wide and approximately 600 feet long. The concrete was non-reinforced, but it was of a strong composition. The average depth of concrete was 18 inches, although one lateral was located on an older section of the apron where the concrete was at most about 10 inches thick. After the concrete had been removed, the trenches were to be excavated somewhat below the level of the adjacent concrete. After the pipes were emplaced, backfill would be added and new concrete poured to a depth of about 23 inches. Once the new concrete was cured, heavy aircraft would roll over the apron as before. Structural soundness of the entire apron once the work was completed was emphasized in the contract.
*197The relevant technical provisions related to the concrete work are as follows:
£-03 REMOVAL OF EXISTING PAVING: The Contractor shall remove existing concrete apron or taxiway pavement and flexible shoulder and roadway pavement to the limits shown on the drawings, or to the extent required to install the refueling system, subject to the approval of the Contracting Officer. Phasing of the work shall be as shown on the drawings and/or SPECIAL CONDITIONS. Existing tie-down anchors removed in apron paving shall be relocated in new pavement. [Emphasis added.]
a. Removal of Concrete Pavement: Where the line of removal does not coincide with an existing joint in the pavement, the Contractor shall cut along the line of removal with an approved concrete saw to a min. depth of saw cut of 6 in. Concrete shall be removed by jackhammers or percussion drills and hydraulic or mechanical expanders without cracking or damaging the adjacent concrete or subgrade. Vertical surfaces shall be thoroughly cleaned and all chips, spalls, and sealing compound shall be removed prior to placement of new concrete. Broken concrete shall be disposed of in waste areas shown. Damages to the adjacent concrete resulting from Contractor's operations shall be satisfactorily repaired at his own expense. [Emphasis added.]
* Ã¢ÂÂ # *
6-29 REPLACEMENT AND REPAIR OF CRACKED AND SPALLED NONREINFORCED CONCRETE SLABS: Replacements or repairs shall be limited to work on slabs adjoining crack[ed] or damaged due to work on this project or containing concrete removed for new piping or electrical work. Random cracks, nonworking contraction joints adjacent to cracks, spalls, and broken slabs shall be repaired as specified hereinafter.
* * * * *
g. Work required under paragraph Replacement and Repair of Cracked and Spalled Nonreinforced Concrete Slabs: Payment will not be made for furnishing any labor, materials, tools, and equipment, and for performing work required by the referenced paragraph when it is determined by the Contracting Officer that the need for the work resulted from negligence or nonconform-*198ounce with the contract flams a/nd specifications by the Contractor. [Emphasis added.]
The contractor received a notice to proceed on the contract dated June 16, 1964. He had scheduled commencement on Item No. 1 for June 29 (all dates 1964 unless otherwise specified), but the actual work did not begin for reasons not clear in the record until July 2. The initial work was the concrete sawing operation. Breakout work began on July 14 and 15. On those 2 days the contractor’s employees at laterals 5 and 6 were using two portable jackhammers of the type commonly observed in use at roadway repair sites. In reaching its decision on these appeals, the Board defined the term “jackhammer” as follows:
A jackhammer is a portable tool hand held by the operator weighing in the neighborhood of 80 to 100 pounds that operates by the application of compressed air to the rear of the bit or head while the latter is held against the pavement. The bit tends to recoil or bounce from the pavement but is not lifted for the purpose of propelling it downward with a striking effect.4
On July 16, however, the resident inspector at Travis Air Force Base for the government (Mr. Meissen) observed the plaintiff’s employees utilizing a heavy wheel-mounted pavement breaker known in the industry as a “stomper.” A stomper, as defined by the Board is:
* * * a much larger device whose operating parts weigh close to 1000 pounds, including an air cylinder about 6 feet high, and is mounted, either on its own 4 wheel self-propelled chassis with a seat for the operator or over the tail gate of a heavy truck. The business or striking end of the stomper as most often used by appellant consisted of a chisel edged bit about 12 inches long and 4 to 5 inches broad. The bit is at the lower end of a rod the upper end of which is connected in turn to a piston seated in the air cylinder. The bit is thrust downward on to the pavement by the repeated action of the piston and returns after each stroke to a position 2 or 3 feet above the pavement. The stomper delivers many times more force at the pavement than a conventional jackhammer.5
*199Mr. Meissen immediately ordered the contractor’s site superintendent (Goetz) to stop using the stomper and to remove it from the site. The grounds for this order were that the stomper was not a tool permissible for concrete breakout under the specifications; and that the terrific impact on the pavement caused by the stomper blow threatened to cause extensive damage to the surrounding concrete apron. The contractor’s employees protested that both of these conclu-tions were erroneous. Nevertheless, later that day (July 16) tbe successor contracting officer (Col. Mathe) confirmed the oral stop order by telegram, as follows:
* * * You are directed to comply strictly with provisions of paragraph 2-03a of contract specifications on removal of concrete pavement. Any tool may be used for breaking or drilling where the bit or gad in contact with the pavement is hit by a hammer. Amy tool where the bit, gad or foot is elevated above the pavement and then dropped or propelled downward against the concrete violates the intent of specification and cannot be used. You are directed to proceed accordingly placing sufficient men and equipment on work so that contract time requirements are met. Confirming letter follows.
Col. Mathe confirmed the stop order by a letter dated July 23, using substantially identical language.
The contractor continued to protest the stop order, contending that a stomper was a kind of jackhammer, thus in compliance with specification 2-03a. The contractor further insisted that he could not practically perform the contract using portable jackhammers and that stomper machines presented no increased risk of damage to the adjacent pavement.
Although convinced that stompers were in violation of the specifications, and capable of causing structural damage to the adjacent concrete, the government personnel involved were not unwilling to listen to the contractor’s contentions. Therefore, on July 20, a conference was held between Tri-Cor and Corps of Engineers personnel to discuss the impasse. At this meeting it was agreed that the contractor would be permitted to perform experiments with the stompers at the site to determine if a method satisfactory to the government *200could be devised that would allow Tri-Cor to use the stompers yet minimize the risk of damage to the adjacent concrete and subgrade. Several days thereafter, the government personnel at least were satisfied that a method of breakout utilizing the stomper had been developed. The details of the procedures approved by the Corps personnel were contained in a letter from Col. Mathe to Tri-Cor dated July 23, which follows:
Reference is made to my letter of 21 July 1964, confirming my telegram of 16 July 1964, concerning pavement removal under Contract No. I)A-04 — 167-ENG-3403. Further reference is made to our conference of 20 July 1964 concerning the concrete pavement removal at which I agreed that you could experiment with the removal in an effort to develop a method utilizing the equipment on the job that would break out the concrete without damage to adjacent concrete or to the subgrade.
I am advised by our Messers. 'Hart and Yokomizo that by experimenting on 21 July 1964 you developed the following method for pavement removal:
a. Drill four lines of '3 inch holes through the slab, one row adjacent to each edge of the removal area and the other two rows approximately on the third points of the removal width.
b. Using the hydra-hammer or “stomper” set to strike at a slow measured pace, rather than with quickly repetitive blows, break out the concrete between the drill holes on one of the third point rows to the depth the striking tool will reach, which is % or % of the depth of the slab.
e.Using the “stomper” and the same blow speed, break out the concrete between the drill holes on the other third point row, at the same time breaking and moving the concrete toward the first row broken.
d. Using a backhoe or Qradall with backhoe attachment, remove the concrete broken under b. and c. above.
e. Using a Gradall with rooter tooth attachment, root between the two third point hole rows until it is assured that the slab is broken through its entire depth between these rows.
f. Using the “stomper” and the same measured blow speed, break down the sides to the removal lines, tipping them into the space vacated under d. and e. above.
g. Remove the broken concrete with a backhoe or Gradall and trim the sides of the cut with one man air driven pavement breakers as necessary.
*201Although, the method outlined above violates the terms of my letter of '21 July 1964, its use will be satisfactory ; provided, the drill hole pattern conforms to the Ã¢ÂÂ inclosed sketch with the 6 inch spacing between holes being used on all rows adjacent to saw cuts and on the row used for initial breaking; provided, the “stomper” is operated to deliver blows at a slow measured pace and not with the quickly repetitive blows of which it is capable; and provided further it is not [*] understood that all costs resulting from the use of the outlined removal method shall be for your accozmt, and that amt damage to adjacent concrete resulting from your opera tions must be satisfactorily repaired by you at you/r expense. [Emphasis added.]
*The word “not” appeal’s to be a typographical error.
At the hearing, Tri-Cor witnesses (especially the company president, Mr. Slatton) denied that plaintiff had participated in the writing of, or had agreed to the method outlined in the July 28 letter. Plaintiff argued that the restrictions on the use of the stomper served no purpose but merely added time and expense to the breakout operation without compensating advantages. Plaintiff also objected to being made strictly liable for damage to the adjacent concrete.
Nevertheless, plaintiff resumed breakout operations on July 25 and followed the method outlined during the performance of the whole of Item No. 1, except for a minor modification not in issue. Plaintiff successfully completed the breakout work on the 6 laterals but instead of the 20 days plaintiff had scheduled for this portion of the work, plaintiff contends the breakout took 97 days. Plaintiff also contends that its costs were greatly increased, partly due to the slower pace and also due to the necessity for drilling the large number of holes discussed in the July 23 letter.
On August 11 the contractor notified the government that a dispute existed on the issue of whether the use of a stomper without restrictions was permissible under the terms of the specifications.
The contractor has based two claims on this issue. First, he argues that since the stomper was a permissible tool under the specifications, the time during which work on Item No. 1 *202was held up between July 16 and July 25 constituted an unreasonable delay for the convenience of the government; hence the contractor is entitled to costs incurred during this period and a time extension under General Provision 30 (the suspension of work article). This is the substance of ASBCA 11955. The contractor also argues (along similar lines) that the stomper procedures imposed on Tri-Cor in the contracting officer’s letter of July 23 constituted a change of the specifications entitling the contractor to an equitable adjustment under General Provision 3 (the changes article). This is the essence of ASBCA 11849.
During the course of performance of the concrete breakout work under the modified procedures, government inspectors at Travis Air Force Base noted what they considered to be extensive damage to the adjacent concrete and subgrade. This damage they attributed to the heavy blows of the stomper. The contracting officer in conformance with a proviso in the last paragraph of his July 23 letter, ordered the contractor to submit a plan for repair of the damage at TriCor’s expense. This order was contained in a letter dated August 6,1964, which stated in part:
* # ¡1: * *
An inspection of the concrete removal on lateral No. 5 on 30 July 1964 and again on 5 August 1964, revealed that considerable damage to the existing concrete has taken place, and. includes excessive underbreakage and cracking of existing concrete.
In view of the above, you are directed to submit, for approval, details covering your proposed method to correct this situation at no additional cost to the Government, as required by paragraph 2-03a of the contract specifications. * * *
Tri-Cor responded to this letter on August 7. The substance of the reply was that when the replacement concrete was poured into the laterals it would flow into any cracked or underbroken areas, and thus achieve the desired repairs without any additional effort on the part of the contractor.
In a letter dated August 14, the contracting officer rejected this proposal. Col. Mathe indicated that while the proposed method might adequately repair areas of light-to-moderate *203damages, there were areas of severe cracking and under-breaking which would remain weakened after the new concrete was added. At the hearing, government witnesses explained that where the damage was severe there was no assurance that the new concrete would completely flow mto the areas of severest damage.
A second Tri-Cor proposal was also rejected as inadequate. Finally (on August 21) the contracting officer accepted a significantly more complex, costly and time-consuming method of repair that promised to satisfactorily repair even the worst damage. This involved application of a two-part epoxy bonding agent, followed by a method of forcing a liquid concrete mixture through a tube, under pressure, into the areas of severe damage, ultimately restoring the vertical sides of the trenches to within 6 inches of the cut lines. The process involved is referred to in the record as “guniting.”
The contractor performed all the required repair work according to the latter method, but also initiated a claim that was before the Board as ASBCA 11952. The contractor contends that he should not have been held strictly liable for the damage to the concrete, by the contracting officer’s letter of July 28, because the stomper was permissible under the specifications. Plaintiff argues that some damage was contemplated in the original contract, which provides (in paragraph 6-29 of the specifications) for repair of damage to adjacent concrete at government expense if the damage is not the fault of the contractor. Plaintiff insists that the damage done was only minor in nature and was a normal incident of any concrete removal operation. However, even if Tri-Cor were liable for performing the repairs, plaintiff argues, the original method proposed on August 1 (involving the replacement concrete) was adequate under the specifications and drawings. For example, plaintiff notes, drawing sheet 37 in the record shows the bottom edges of the adjacent concrete resting on the new concrete, illustrative of the fact that some undercutting was envisioned when the contract was written. Therefore plaintiff concludes the gunit-ing operation was extra work, outside the specifications, for *204whicla Tri-Cor is entitled to an adjustment under the changes clause.

A. The Method of Concrete Breakout

In resolving plaintiff’s contentions that the use of stompers was in compliance with the specifications, the principal issue confronted by the Board was the proper interpretation of specification 2-03a.
It is a well-established principle that the interpretation of a contract is an issue of law. Therefore, the decision of an administrative board interpreting a contract specification is not entitled to finality and is not binding on this court. Martin Lane Co. v. United States, 193 Ct. Cl. 203, 207-08, 432 F. 2d 1013, 1015 (1970). However, even if the ultimate interpretation is a question of law, “the underlying factual determinations [of the Board] are entitled to finality if substantially supported.” D & L Constr. Co. v. United States, 185 Ct. Cl. 736, 743, 402 F. 2d 990, 993 (1968).
In the instant case the Board held that:
On the evidence we have no doubt that the use of stompers was not authorized by section 2-03a of the specification.6
The Board reached this interpretation based upon its findings of fact. The parties, in their moving briefs in this court, essentially treat the interpretation issue as depending on the soundness of the Board’s findings of fact. This appears to be the correct approach. Taking the findings as a whole, if they are supported by substantial evidence, then the interpretation found by the Board is virtually dictated as the only reasonable one. This is true, at least with regard to the contentions made by the plaintiff. This is because reading the specifications as a Whole, in light of the clearly expressed purposes of the contract, paragraph 2-03a cannot reasonably be read to permit the use of heavy pavement breakers of the stomper type.
A fair reading of the evidence presented in this case before the Board leads to the conclusion that the findings *205of fact made by the Board are supported by substantial evidence.
The basic contention of the plaintiff is that the use of stamper machines is in full compliance with the terms of the specifications. This is true, argues the contractor, because a stomper is nothing more than a large, wheel-mounted jackhammer, as that term is used in paragraph 2-03a. Plaintiff notes that neither party was able to present to the Board any standard definition of the term “jackhammer” that either expressly or impliedly includes or excludes stomper-type tools. Therefore, industry experience must be relied upon, and plaintiff argues that in the industry, stampers are normally utilized in concrete breaking operations of the type involved in this contract. Plaintiff also refers to the contracting officer’s stop orders of July 16 and July 21, in which a distinction is drawn between tools on which the bit rests against the pavement and is struck from above, and tools on which the bit is elevated above the pavement and propelled or dropped downward. The contracting officer regarded tools in the former category (portable jackhammers and percussion drills) as permissible, but tools in the latter category (stampers) as in violation of the specifications. Plaintiff argues that this distinction is invalid because even the bit on a portable jackhammer bounces above the pavement during operation. Most of the testimony on behalf of the plaintiff on these points was presented by two witnesses. Mr. Slatton (Tri-Cor’s president) testified on the basis of long experience in the construction industry, and on the basis of periodic visits to the site at Travis, supplemented by daily reports from his personnel permanently located there. An expert witness (Mr. Warner), who was presented as a construction consultant, testified generally on the problems presented by this contract. The qualifications of the expert were vigorously disputed by counsel for the government, but the hearing officer (while noting the objection) permitted Mr. Warner to testify. Mr. Goetz (the Tri-Cor superintendent at Travis) also testified on the use of the stampers, but more briefly.
*206The Board found that a stomper is not the same type of tool as the one commonly referred to as a j ackhammer.7 The Board considered evidence presented by the government that the difference between these machines is more than the fact that one is larger than the other. The stomper actually functions differently. The stomper bit is raised several feet in the air and is propelled downward with great force into the pavement. The jackhammer bit is placed against the pavement and is propelled directly against it. While the jackhammer bit may recoil somewhat above the pavement, it is not deliberately elevated. 'Consequently, the jackhammer blow is more localized and significantly less potent than that delivered by the heavy pavement breaker. Several employees of the Sacramento District, Corps of Engineers, testified as to these distinctions. These witnesses had never heard a stomper referred to as a jackhammer, nor had they seen any documentation so referring to a stomper. Taken as a whole, the testimony in the record (supplemented by photographs of the stomper and exhibits describing portable jackhammers) strongly supports the Board finding that a jackhammer is functionally a distinct type of tool from the heavy pavement breakers known as stompers. Conversely, the plaintiff’s evidence does not detract from the finding, but merely serves to establish that the two types of tools perform the same purpose — breaking concrete.
A second key contention by the plaintiff is that the term “jackhammer” must be read as including stompers because it would be practically impossible to perform the concrete breakout work on the Travis apron using portable jackhammers. Illustrative of this fact (in plaintiff’s view) is the work done by Tri-Cor employees using portable jackhammers on July 14 and July 15. The total progress, using two jackhammers over the 2-day period was a mere 1 feet of 5-foot-wide lateral. At this pace, to complete the breakout work oh all 6 laterals within the 20-day time period plaintiff had scheduled for this work, plaintiff estimated that it would have needed to employ between 100 and 200 men with half *207as many jackhammers. Therefore, plaintiff insists heavy pavement breakers were not only permissible, they were required to complete the breakout within reasonable cost and time limitations.
However, as the Board found, the contention that portable jackhammers alone were not adequate to perform the contract (even if true) does not meet the language of the specifications. Its discussion on this point reads thus:
The contention is without merit. In the first place, section 2-ÃÂ3 a did not refer exclusively to jackhammers but to jackhammers OR percussion drills. In the second place, section 2-03 a did not provide that either, or both, of those two tools when selected would be the exclusive means of breaking the pavement. Section 2-03a required that the use of either jackhammers or percussion drills be accompanied by the use of pavement expanders. Appellant’s argument, therefore, ignores that portion of section '2-03 a which, on the evidence, is the most significant portion of all, namely, the use of directional pavement expanders which, on the evidence, would overcome the tension that was the chief obstacle to the 'breakout, and do this in the most practical and least damaging manner. The stompers were in fact not only different in principle and in their effect on the pavement from hand held jackhammers but their use defeated ends which, on the evidence, would have been served by the use of pavement expanders.8
Mr. Meissen '(the resident inspector), Messrs. Hart and Mead (of the Corps of Engineers), Mr. Cable (the government estimator on the contract) and Mr. Gutherie (a geologist of the Corps of Engineers) all testified as to the practicality of laterally moving the concrete through the use of jackhammers, percussion drills and mechanical or hydraulic ex-panders — all tools listed in pargraph 2-03«. As found by the Board, a percussion drill is similar to a jackhammer, but has an additional rotary motion of the bit. Pavement expanders (also called “rock-jacks”) are cylinders which are placed in drill holes in the pavement, the cylinders are equipped with plungers or jacks which are manipulated to exert a terrific pressure on the concrete slabs in the direction of an open *208space in the pavement, causing the concrete to fail in tension. The Board found (and ample testimony of a detailed and persuasive nature tended to prove) that the use of these tools in conjunction with each other provided a means, not only to break out the concrete in an efficient and economical manner, but to do so in a way that did not present any significant risk of damage to the adjacent concrete or subgrade. The Board stated:
* * * The evidence would not justify a conclusion that there is any actual or practical impossibility inherent in an application of the described method to the concrete pavement here involved.9
This court has recently stated in Koppers Co. v. United States, 186 Ct. C1. 142, 149-50, 405 F. 2d 554, 558 (1968) that:
Whether specifications are factually impossible or commercially impracticable to perform is a question of fact, not of law * * * and should be decided by the Board. [Citation omitted.]
Although plaintiff contends that the finding of the Board (to the effect that the use of directional pavement expanders would have been practically possible) is not supported by substantial evidence, there is ample testimony from which the Board was able to draw this conclusion. While the statement by the Board that “ [t]here is no evidence that appellant ever took into account the possibility of relieving the tension in the concrete in the strips by moving it laterally with pavement expanders”10 may be too strong, the evidence clearly indicates that the plaintiff was committed to the use of stompers and did not attempt to devise alternate means of removal.
In summary, there is substantial evidence in the record to support the findings of the Board that paragraph 2-03a did not explicitly permit the use of stompers and that the specifications did not impliedly permit the use of stompers, because it was practically possible to perform contract work under the *209specifications without heavy pavement breakers. In addition, it becomes unreasonable to read the specifications as permitting the use of heavy pavement breakers when consideration is given to that portion of paragraph 2-03a which directs that “ [cjoncrete shall be removed * * * without cracking or damaging the adjacent concrete or sub grade[Emphasis added.] The primary consideration of the government in preventing the use of stompers was the risk that the heavy stomper blows would cause damage in the adjacent portions of the concrete apron. Plaintiff insists that the stomper did not present any significant risk of damage to the subgrade or adjacent concrete. Plaintiff does not deny that there was some cracking and underbreaking in the adjacent concrete, but plaintiff characterizes this damage as minor, as a normal incident of any method of breakout, and as damage of a nature that was contemplated in the terms of the contract specifications and drawings. Plaintiff especially contends that there is no evidence that the stomper caused this damage.
However, there is rather overwhelming evidence in the record (in the form of testimony by Corps of Engineers personnel, of inspection reports by government inspectors and of photographs and sketches) that there was severe damage to the adjacent concrete and subgrade. There is also substantial evidence that the types of damage that occurred were peculiarly of the types it had been feared the stomper would cause. There is also substantial evidence that the lateral movement of the concrete by the use of expanders would not have caused any substantial damage to the adjacent concrete. The contentions of the plaintiff, then, cannot be accepted. The findings of the Board on the nature of the damage are as follows:
During execution of work by the modified stomping method there was breakage below the surface of adjacent pavement beyond the indicated cut lines, described by the parties as “underbreakage.”
A preponderance of evidence establishes that the use of the stompers within the area of the hydrant lateral strips heavily damaged existing adjacent pavement beneath the surface. The heavy blows of the stompers did not produce vertical shearing or horizontal fracture *210but rather sloping lines of fracture varying between 20° to 60° from the vertical, roughly approximating the sloping sides of a cone whose apex would be the point of impact on the surface. Where the point of impact was near the specified cut line of the lateral strips, those sloping lines extended under the surface of the adjacent pavement, producing the underbreakage in question. The voids created under the adjacent surface of pavement were not always open to view from the area of the excavated lateral strip but were partly obscured by overhanging projections of concrete which had not been broken loose.
Moreover, it was found that the subgrade had become separated from the adjacent pavement along the borders of the lateral strips, a condition which has not been accounted for by any events other than additional compaction of the subgrade caused by the heavy blows of the stampers.11
Given the fact that there was some damage to the adjacent concrete and subgrade, the Board finding that the damage was excessive was a pure finding of fact to be drawn from the conflicting evidence. There was more than substantial evidence in the record to support the finding actually made. Furthermore, evidence by government witnesses characterized some of this damage as sloping lines of fracture extending from the open laterals into the adjacent concrete. Other damage was described as compaction of the subgrade under the adjacent concrete. The only reasonable inference from the evidence is that this damage was the result of the stomper blows on the lateral pavement. Plaintiff denies that this conclusion is proper, but it offered no evidence that would suggest any other possible cause of these types of damage. The evidence also justified the Board conclusion that such damage would not have occurred had the breakout been achieved by the use of portable jackhammers, percussion drills and pavement expanders. The use of these tools obviously would have avoided subjecting the apron to the crushing impact that was the primary characteristic of the stomper operation.
It is true (as the contractor points out) that paragraph *2116-29g of tlie specifications provided that the government would absorb the repair costs of incidental damage not the fault of the contractor. It is also true that drawing sheet 37 shows the edges of adjacent concrete resting on a new base of the replacement concrete in the laterals. Together these documents show that some degree of damage was allowable or even anticipated. These facts do not avail the contractor here, because the finding of the Board was that the damage was not only more severe but also different in kind than that indicated in the contract documents.
The contract directed that damage of this order should be avoided. The specifications listed tools that could be used to avoid this type of damage. The Board found that the specifications (read in this context) could not be interpreted to permit the use of heavy pavement breakers. This interpretation appears to be the correct one — indeed, on the evidence, it appears to be the only reasonable interpretation.
Plaintiff urges, as an alternative ground of relief, that the specification 2-03<z was ambiguous, apparently attempting to take advantage of the rule that ambiguities in specifications drawn by the government are resolved in favor of the interpretation relied on by the contractor. However, this rule applies only if the contractor has made a reasonable interpretation of the specification. E.g., Jamsar, Inc. v. United States, 194 Ct. Cl. 819, 442 F. 2d 930 (1971). As indicated above, it would not be a reasonable interpretation to view the specifications as authorizing the use of stompers.
The better view is that the specification 2~03a is not ambiguous. A contract is not rendered ambiguous merely because the parties disagree as to its meaning when the disagreement is not based on reasonable uncertainty of the meaning of the language used. Bishop Engineering Co. v. United States, 180 Ct. Cl. 411, 416 (1967). The court also stated in that case that:
* * * The fact that an improvident interpretation placed by a contractor upon the specifications may even be considered conceivable, is not a sufficient basis alone for construction of the contract against the author of the language, if not reasonable when the contract is con*212sidered as a whole and in light of the purpose of the contract. * * * [p. ÃÂ©l6.]
Finally, if the contractor thought that the specifications were practically impossible to perform, he was not free merely to assume that he could substitute a stomper for the listed tools. General Provision 2 of the contract provides in part:
* * * In case of discrepancy * * * in the specifications, the matter shall be promptly submitted to the 'Contracting Officer, who shall promptly make a determination in writing. Any adjustment l>y the Contractor without such a determination shall he at his own risk and expense. * * * [Emphasis added.]
See Jamsar, Inc. v. United States, supra.
While not determinative of the course the contractor should have pursued, the record reveals that during the prebid period two potential bidders actually did inquire whether stompers or heavy pavement breakers would be permitted for use during the breakout work. These inquiries were answered in the negative.
Plaintiff seeks to characterize these inquiries from other bidders as an indication that the industry considered the term “jackhammer” to include heavy pavement breakers. However, it seems equally likely (as the government notes) that these inquiries indicate that the other firms did not feel comfortable in interpreting “jackhammer” to include stomper. Even more significant, at the time these inquiries were made, the only tool mentioned in specification 2-03a was the jackhammer. Shortly after these inquiries the specification was amended to include percussion drills and mechanical or hydraulic expanders. There was some evidence that the purpose of this amendment was to clarify the specification by adding all the tools thought suitable for concrete breakout without risking unacceptable damage to the adjacent concrete and subgrade. In retrospect, it may seem that the wiser course would have been for the government to have notified all potential bidders specifically that heavy pavement breakers would not be allowed. Yet the amendment that was made, at least should have made all the more clear to *213the bidders, the type of concrete breakout operation that was desired. It is one more indication that Tri-Cor’s interpretation of paragraph 2-03a was not reasonable.
For all the foregoing reasons, it must be concluded that the Board’s decision (that specification 2-03a 'did not permit the use of stompers) was supported by substantial evidence and was correct as a matter of law.
Since the contractor had no contractual right to the use of stompers, the contracting officer was entitled to prevent their use by his July 16 stop order. The Board decision that the delay subsequent to the stop order was not the fault of the government (in ASBCA 11955) must be taken as correct and the contractor is not entitled to a price increase or time extension.
Similarly, when the contracting officer permitted the contractor to use stompers, this action was entirely for the benefit of the contractor, and the contracting officer could condition the use of these machines in any way he considered necessary. Thus the contracting officer’s letter of July 23 was not a compensable change of the specifications within the meaning of the changes articles of the contract. The contractor was not in any sense required to use Stompers — he was given permission to use them if he so desired. The contractor could have used alternative means fully conforming with the specifications to perform the breakout work. When he chose to use the stompers, he could not complain that their use was restricted, or that he had to be fully responsible for any damage to the adjacent concrete or subgrade. Thus the decision of the Board in ASBCA 11849 must also be upheld.

B. The Repair of the Adjacent Concrete

Paragraph 2-03a of the specifications directed that the concrete be removed from the laterals without causing damage to the adjacent concrete or subgra'de. Paragraph 6-29y of the specifications provided that the contractor alone must bear the expense of repairing the adjacent concrete if the need for the work was caused by the negligence of the contractor or by his nonconformance with the specifications and *214drawings. The contracting officer’s letter of July 23 permitting the contractor to use stomper machines warned that any damage to adjacent concrete must be satisfactorily repaired by the contractor at his own expense, as a condition of using the equipment in violation of the specifications.
It has already been determined that the Board correctly found that stomper machines were not permitted by the specifications. The Board made a finding of fact (supported by substantial evidence) that the use of the stompers caused severe and excessive damage to the adjacent concrete and subgrade. Thus, even disregarding the terms of the July 23 letter, the Board was entitled to conclude that the contractor was bound to repair the adjacent areas at his own expense.
Conversely, under the terms of the July 23 letter, it is irrelevant whether the damage was excessive or not. The contractor was not required to follow the procedures outlined in the letter. He could have abandoned the use of stompers and complied with the terms of specification 2-03a. Having chosen to continue with the use of the stomper, as restricted, the contractor did so cognizant of the proviso that he would be liable for any resulting damage.
The only question remaining under the issue of concrete repair as presented in ASBCA 11952 is whether the contractor was required to perform the repair work by an excessively complex, costly and time-consuming method. The Board found that:
* * * guniting was an appropriate and necessary means for filling the deep voids created beneath the surface of the adjacent pavement by the stomping operation, and would promote adequate transfer of loads incident to the passage of aircraft between new lateral strip pavement and adjacent old pavement.12
Determining the method of concrete repair suitable to restore damaged concrete to a condition at which it is again safe to permit the passage of heavy military aircraft over the apron is a pure finding of fact to be made from an assessment of the conflicting evidence.
*215The plaintiff (as previously indicated) initially proposed that the broken and undercut areas of the adjacent concrete would be filled in by the addition of replacement concrete in the laterals. Plaintiff subsequently proposed that a grouting mixture be applied with a trowel. Both these proposals were rejected by the government on the basis that they were inadequate to strengthen the damaged concrete. These methods did not permit concrete to flow completely back into the broken and cracked areas. Consequently, voids would remain in the concrete apron imder the surface, creating a risk that the apron would collapse under the weight of heavy aircraft.
It has already been determined that the Board finding that the damage was of a serious nature was supported by substantial evidence. There was also considerable evidence in the record that many of the cracked areas were too small to permit the normal flow of concrete into them. Others extended too far back into the apron. On the basis of this evidence, the Board was justified in finding that the gunite method of repair was reasonably necessary to fully restore the areas of damage. While the methods initially proposed by plaintiff would have been adequate if the damage had been minor, there was no evidence indicating that the proposals were responsive to the degree of damage that was found to exist.
Consequently, the plaintiff merely lived up to his contractual obligation to repair in performing the guniting operation. There was no extra work involved compensable imder the changes article. The conclusion of the Board that the plaintiff is not entitled to recover in ASBCA 11952 must be upheld as supported by substantial evidence.

III. Late Receipt of Hydrant Relocation Drawings

The purpose of the hydrant outlets branching off from each of the 6 laterals to be constructed under Item No. 1 of the contract, was to provide convenient locations for delivery of the fuel supplied by the pressurized fuel lines running from the hydrant pumphouse through the laterals. Part of the excavation job on each lateral was the construe*216tion of so-called lateral boxes — concrete pits similar to a manhole, in which the branch piping from the laterals would terminate, to be connected to the valving and controls known as the hydrant outlets.
There were to be a total of 6 hydrant boxes constructed from laterals 5 and 6 — 3 from each lateral. By July 31,1964, plaintiff was preparing to commence the work on these hydrant boxes when the following telegram, dated July 31, was received from Col. Mathe, the contracting officer:
* * Ã¢ÂÂ¡ *
You are directed to proceed immediately with relocating fueling hydrants Nos. 220 to 225 inclusive on laterals 5 and 6. Hydrants to be relocated approx. 28 ft SE of present location. New locations painted on pavement. Confirming letter follows.
No reason for the relocation order was given, nor is it revealed in the record. It is not alleged by plaintiff, however, that the change was motivated by faulty specifications.
The contractor attempted to proceed with the work but apparently the plaintiff’s employees were unable to interpret the markings on the pavement. Consequently, on August 3, Col. Mathe advised the plaintiff that he could proceed “in accordance with revised drawings, which will be issued in the near future.” On August 6, the contracting officer notified Tri-Cor that every hydrant box on all 6 laterals would be relocated. Therefore, on August 12 the contractor was requested to prepare a proposal for “furnishing all labor, material and equipment and performing all work to relocate fueling hydrants for Laterals 1 through 6.”
The contractor ultimately received the drawings setting forth the revisions to the hydrant locations on laterals 5 and 6 on or about August 14, 1964. The drawings applicable to laterals 1 through 4 were received on or about August 20. The contractor completed the work successfully according to these drawings.
A change order (designated Modification No. 3) was issued on October 19, 1964, embodying the agreement of the parties as to the cost of the extra work occasioned by the hydrant relocation for all 6 laterals. The contract price was *217increased by $18,221 and the completion date of Item No. 1 was extended from October 1 to October 12. As the Board correctly notes,13 the contractor has accepted Modification No. 3 as an appropriate adjustment for the extra work incident to the change order.
However, in a letter to Col. Mathe dated October 22,1964, the contractor indicated the following reservations to the scope of the modification:
Ã¢ÂÂ¢js »i» »!» Ã¢ÂÂ¢}» >{Ã¢ÂÂ¢
2) On Page 2 of the Modification we do not agree with the time extension and must insist on a time extension as requested in our proposal.
3) Our rights are reserved in connection with all costs brought about by unreasonable delays encountered or which may be encountered with the subject changes in the work.
4) Our rights are reserved in connection with any acceleration claims now or hereafter filed.
The essence of the plaintiff’s objections referenced in the above letter is that the modification made no provision for compensating the contractor for the period of delay he suffered between July 31 and August 14. The plaintiff contends that all work was at a virtual standstill during this period; the interruption occurred at a critical time, and because of the peculiarities of the order of work for contract performance created by the terms of the contract, Tri-Cor was unable to shift its efforts to other portions of the contract. While the contractor did not hold his employees idle, the work done during this period was merely fill-in and did not expedite later scheduled items in any meaningful way. Consequently, the contractor views this delay incident to the change order as unreasonable in its entirety. Therefore, the contractor seeks compensation for his overhead costs during this period, as well as a time extension to the contract, of 8 days.
The holding of the Board on this point was that the contractor had not sustained his burden of showing that the unchanged portions of Item No. 1 were delayed to an irnrea-sonable extent by the late receipt of the drawing revisions, *218after taking into account tbe countervailing effect of any forward progress not contingent on tbe delayed work or accomplished 'by reason of revisions in tbe order of performance of work. Tbe Board stated:
* * * On the evidence we cannot find that appellant suffered any delay to the unchanged portion of any phase of Item 1 by reason of the late receipt of drawing revisions for hydrant relocations, and consequently cannot find that there was any unreasonable, compensable delay in connection therewith for the purposes of the suspension of work clause. The appeal in ASBCA No. 12001, therefore, will be denied.14
This conclusion was based on a number of findings of fact. First the Board found that the plaintiff had not shown why any work stoppage was necessary. The Board noted that the concrete on laterals 5 and 6 had to be removed wherever the hydrant boxes might be located. The Board considered the testimony of Mr. Meissen (the government’s resident inspector) and daily inspection reports made during the period in question. This evidence indicated that during the period when the contractor alleges no meaningful work was done—
* * * appellant was breaking out concrete on 8 days, removing concrete rubble on 2 days, backfilling on 5 days, grading on '2 days, laying pipe on 2 days, working on pipe covers on 2 days, welding on 3 days, and working on the #5 control pit on 3 days, all under phase 1 of Item 1. To the extent of the pipe work appellant anticipated the order of work contemplated in appellant’s own schedule, since the schedule contemplated that all concrete be broken out for a particular phase before the setting of any pipe, although this subphasing was not required by the contract * * *.15
The Board noted that the documentation showed that the contractor utilized a greater work force and a greater number of direct labor hours on the average, during the period of the supposed delay, than previously. The amount of equipment declined, the Board found, because the concrete breakout work on laterals 5 and 6 was nearly completed. Thus the Board concluded:
*219* * * it is obvious that appellant did not stand by on the unchanged portion of phase 1 waiting for hydrant relocation drawings. Appellant partially inverted its own schedule for unchanged work on phase 1 by postponing some concrete breakout work on laterals 5 and 6 and performing instead some work which appellant had not scheduled to take place until completion of all concrete breakout on those laterals. The work thus accomplished out of order would have been in the critical path of progress at a later date if not so executed. In addition appellant performed other unchanged phase 1 work that was not contingent on further concrete breakout.16
*****
Mr. Meissen testified that all the above work was major under the contract and that in his conversations with TriCor’s site superintendent (Goetz) the latter never indicated that the work being done during this period was fill-in.
The plaintiff contends that none of this work materially advanced the performance of the contract, and that any findings of the Board that it did so, were not supported by substantial evidence. Slatton testified for Tri-Cor that each of the items of work discussed by the Board was relatively insignificant and that the breakout of the concrete in the hydrant boxes was a prerequisite to any meaningful progression.
The most that can be said for the contention of the plaintiff as to the character of the work that could be done during the July 31-August 14 period is that there was evidence in the record that would have justified the Board in concluding that the work done was or was not meaningful to the completion of phase 1. This was clearly a finding of fact to be made by the Board. The weight to be given to the evidence and the conclusions to be drawn therefrom were for the Board. Although the evidence was conflicting, there was substantial evidence in support of the Board finding that the contractor did not suffer any damage on account of the period of the delay. The court stated in Chaney & James Constr. *220Co. v. United States, 190 Ct. Cl. 699, 717, 421 F. 2d 728, 738 (1970):
* * * In such a situation, the court is inhibited by the first section of the Wunderlich Act from independently weighing the conflicting evidence in the administrative record for the purpose of ascertaining where the preponderance of the evidence lies.
»ÃÂ­» Ã¢ÂÂ¦!» $ H*
The suspension of work clause of this contract [General Provision 30, at subsection (b)] provides in relevant part:
(b) If, without the fault or negligence of the Contractor, the performance of all or any part of the work is for an wrvreasonoMe 'period of time, suspended, delayed, or interrupted by an act of the Contracting Officer in the administration of the contract * * * an adjustment shall be made by the Contracting Officer for any increase in the cost of performance of the contract (excluding profit) necessarily caused by the unreasonable period of such suspension, delay * * *. [Emphasis added.]
An identical clause was recently interpreted by this court in the following terms:
* * * the “suspension of work” provision of the contract distinguishes between a reasonable period of delay and an unreasonable period of delay. It is only in the less common situations, such as those in which the delay is due to defective specifications, that cdl of the delay is unreasonable. Consequently, not all of the delay [at issue] was necessarily unreasonable, even though plaintiff was at a critical stage of the work when the stop order was issued.
Chaney & James Constr. Co. v. United States, supra, 190 Ct. Cl. at 712-13, 421 F. 2d at 735.
The distinction between reasonable and unreasonable periods of delay incident to the issuance of changes to the contract specifications and drawings has, not surprisingly, been the object of frequent litigation. In the most recent pronouncement by this court referring to delays, it was observed that:
* * * the mere fact that defendant took four weeks, or four months, or even longer, is in itself meaningless. The *221length of time is meaningful only in relation to the effect it had on the project operations * * * one month or even less might be unreasonable. * * *
Law v. United States, 195 Ct. Cl. 370, 384-85 (1971). What is a reasonable period of time for the government to do a particular act under the contract is entirely dependent upon the circumstances of the particular case. Specialty Assembling & Packing Co. v. United States, 174 Ct. Cl. 153, 170, 355 F. 2d 554, 565 (1966).
In F. H. McGraw & Co. v. United States, 131 Ct. Cl. 501, 506-07, 130 F. Supp. 394, 397 (1955), where a government change order suspended all work on the changed portion of the contract and also on most other portions because they were dependent on the changed portions, the court scrutinized with care the time taken by the government and found a reasonable time to be quite brief. In other cases, however, where the contractor was able to mitigate the effects of delay by shifting to other portions of the contract work, quite lengthy delays have been found to be reasonable. E.g., Continental Illinois Nat. Bank & T. Co. v. United States, 121 Ct. Cl. 203, 242-43, 101 F. Supp. 755, 757, cert. denied 343 U.S. 963 (1952).
In the instant case the Board found that the contractor was able, during the period of delay, to perform meaningful work that enhanced the completion of phase 1 of Item No. 1. This finding was supported by substantial evidence in the record. Therefore, the Board was entitled to conclude that Tri-Cor was not subjected to an unreasonable period of delay compensable under the suspension of work article. The further contention of the plaintiff that this conclusion by the Board was erroneous as a matter of law is without merit.

IV. The Acceleration Claim

On July 16 and July 21, and again on September 11,1964, the contracting officer notified plaintiff that contract performance was behind schedule and directed Tri-Cor to take whatever steps were necessary to meet the Item No. 1 completion date. In ASBCA 12031, plaintiff sought a price ad*222justment based on the additional costs that were incurred by Tri-Cor in compliance with these acceleration directives.
However, plaintiff’s sole contention is that if it is found to be entitled to the time extension sought in ASBCA 11849, 11952, 11955 and 12001, then as of July 16, July 21 and September 11, it would have been ahead of a properly adjusted schedule. However, it has been determined that the Board properly denied these four claims. Plaintiff was not entitled to the claimed time extensions.
It follows that the Board properly denied plaintiff’s appeal in ASBCA 12031.

V. Remission of Liquidated Damages

Plaintiff claims (in ASBCA 12028) that if the time extensions demanded in ASBCA 11849, 11952, 11955 and 12001 are granted, it would have completed Item No. 1 on time according to a properly adjusted completion date. In that case it would have been entitled to remission of the liquidated damages assessed because of its failure to complete Item No. 1 by October 17.
However, the Board properly denied all the claimed time extensions. The Board, then, necessarily denied plaintiff’s contentions in ASBCA 12028.

VI. The Impact CHaim

Plaintiff was not entitled to recover on any of its claims in ASBCA 11849, 11952, 11955,12001 and 12031. A fortiori, it is not entitled to a total cost recovery based on the cumulative damages alleged by Tri-Cor incident to the substantive claims. The Board properly denied plaintiff’s contentions in ASBCA 12030.
CONCLUSION
The plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment in opposition to the decision of the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals in ASBCA Nos. 11849, 11952, 11955, 12001, 12028, 12030 and 12031 is denied. The defendant’s motion for summary judgment in support of the decision of the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals on the same appeals is granted. The plaintiff’s petition is dismissed.

9315476,9320171,66600516,Kovalcik v. G. C. Murphy Co.,Kovalcik v. G. C. Murphy Co.,"
GLADDEN, J.,
This case reaches us on the preliminary objection of defendant in the nature of a demurrer, which claims the running of the statute of limitations.
On May 22, 1967, plaintiff-wife fell on the sidewalk *403in front of defendant’s place of business located at 630 McKean Avenue, Donora, Pa. On May 15, 1969, a praecipe for writ of summons in trespass was filed with the prothonotary by plaintiffs and issued to the sheriff where it was docketed. Subsequently, on January 25, 1971, the summons was reissued and served together with a complaint in trespass upon defendant at its place of business located on Main Street in Washington, Pa.
Defendant objects to the service as being beyond the two-year statute of limitations and alleges that no good reason existed to excuse plaintiffs for delaying the service.
We are asked to dismiss the complaint.
Defendant cites as authority for its request the case of Amati v. Campbell decided by our court and reported at 51 Wash. 1 (1970). In that case, a praecipe for summons was filed but written across its face was the instruction, “Please do not serve.” Our court held in that case that the phrase, “Please do not serve,” rendered void the original summons, so that the statute of limitations continues to run.
It is not alleged that any such phrase appears on the praecipe for summons in the within case. There is no question that here the summons was, in fact, issued by the prothonotary to the sheriff where it was docketed. Plaintiffs paid the docket fees to the sheriff but issued no affirmative instructions to have the summons served. It is defendant’s contention that the failure of plaintiffs to instruct the sheriff to serve the summons was tantamount to a “hold” order and, therefore, the two-year statute of limitations continued to run and was not tolled.
We see an obvious distinction in the Amati case and the matter before us. A “Please do not serve” order was never given to the prothonotary in this *404case. This court in Amati (DiSalle, J., dissenting) considered such instructions to nullify the praecipe, just as if it had never been filed at all. In the instant case, however, the summons was issued to the sheriff, which action carried it one step beyond the situation in Amati.
Pennsylvania Rule of Civil Procedure 1007 provides that the action is commenced, inter alia, by praecipe for writ of summons. The commencement of the action tolls the statute of limitations. See Goodrich-Amram comments 1007-3. If the praecipe is a nullity because of the deliberate act of plaintiff in the manner of a “hold” order, the statute of limitations is not tolled. Absent such a deliberate act, then we regard the summons as having tolled the statute of limitations.
So long as the summons is reissued and served with a complaint within two years from the date it was filed, the service is good.
Defendant has cited the case of Peterson v. Philadelphia Suburban Transportation Co., 435 Pa. 232 (1969), as stating the law on this question. We do not disagree here with the Peterson decision, but we are of the opinion that the factual situation there is so dissimilar to the matter now under consideration that Peterson has no application. We do, however, quote from that decision certain dicta which we believe is pertinent. Justice Pomeroy, at page 242, writes:
“Plaintiffs here could have caused the reissuance of the writ at any time until September 9, 1966 two years from the filing of the original praecipe.”
We believe that this dictum in the Peterson case is a correct statement of the law of Pennsylvania.
We, therefore, hold that the action against the within defendant was commenced when the unrestricted praecipe for writ of summons was filed with *405the prothonotary on May 15, 1969, and that the statute of limitations was tolled for a period of two years from that date. Since plaintiffs have caused the summons to reissue and have caused it to be served, together with their complaint, within the two-year period computed from May 15, 1969, we find that there has been good service and would dismiss the preliminary objections.
Before making an order to accomplish that dismissal, however, we shall pass briefly on plaintiffs’ argument that the defense of statute of limitations has been improperly raised by preliminary objections. Plaintiffs claim that such a defense should be set forth as new matter in defendant’s answer. This would give plaintiffs an opportunity to answer the defense raised in the new matter. We have read the case of Goldstein v. Stadler, 417 Pa. 589, and concluded that the filing of preliminary objections in this case raising the defense of statute of limitations is improper. See also Sorgini v. Porter, 48 D. & C.2d 305 (1970).
Since we have disposed of the question of whether or not the statute of limitations was tolled, we see no reason to allow defendant additional time in which to plead new matter raising this defense. To do so would invite the parties to the next session of argument court to argue that which has already been decided.
Based on the above, we now enter the following
ORDER
And now, April 30, 1971, the preliminary objections filed by defendant are dismissed. Defendant shall have 20 days in which to file an answer.

5969396,6104722,62464848,Peters v. City of Kingston,"Karen K. Peters v. City of Kingston, and Nancy Chevalier","
Yesawich Jr., J.
Appeal from an order of the Supreme Court (Kahn, J.), entered August 7, 1992 in Ulster County, which denied a motion by defendant City of Kingston for summary judgment dismissing the complaint and all cross claims against it.
Plaintiff brought this action to recover for injuries sustained when she fell, assertedly because of a sidewalk defect, in the City of Kingston, Ulster County. After issue was joined and some discovery completed, defendant City of Kingston moved for summary judgment dismissing the complaint and cross claims against it on the ground that no previous written notice of the defect had been received by the City, as required by the City charter. Plaintiff and defendant Nancy Chevalier —who owned the premises when work on the sidewalk was performed, and is charged with allowing an unsafe condition to exist thereon—submitted deposition excerpts in opposition to the motion. Finding a question of fact with regard to whether the City had affirmatively created the dangerous condition, Supreme Court denied the requested relief. The City appeals.
In support of its motion, the City submitted the affidavit of the Superintendent of its Board of Public Works which establishes that no written notice of the defect had been received by the City prior to the accident. This is sufficient to shift the burden to plaintiff, who, to withstand summary judgment, was obliged to either demonstrate the existence of a triable issue of fact with respect to receipt of notice or proffer some evidence that the City affirmatively created the defect, which renders written notice unnecessary (see, Ferris v County of Suffolk, 174 AD2d 70, 72; Fezza v Rogers, 167 AD2d 599, 600). Plaintiff has done neither.
The record indicates that, in December 1989, defendant Lowe Plumbing, Heating & Air Conditioning, Inc. obtained an excavation permit from the City for the purpose of effecting repairs on underground water or sewer lines in the immediate vicinity of plaintiffs subsequent fall. Excavation of the street, and some portion of the sidewalk as well, was performed in connection with this work. After the plumbing work was complete and had been inspected by the City plumbing inspector, the excavation was closed and City employees proceeded *810to repave the street adjacent to the sidewalk. According to the Superintendent, repair of the sidewalk was considered the responsibility of the contractors, not the City.
In an attempt to raise a question of fact with regard to the City’s affirmative negligence, plaintiff submitted excerpts from the Superintendent’s deposition in which he admitted that the City had issued the permit, inspected the underground plumbing work and repaved the street. Noticeably lacking, however, is any proof connecting these actions with the condition of the sidewalk. There is no evidence establishing when the defect first appeared or that it was ""visible and apparent” when City employees were working at the scene (cf., Ferris v County of Suffolk, supra, at 75). Nor is there any showing made that the paving work performed by the City actually caused the defect, or even that it might have done so (compare, Gormley v County of Nassau, 150 AD2d 342). Accordingly, summary judgment should have been granted in favor of the City.
Mikoll, J. P., Mercure and Crew III, JJ., concur. Ordered that the order is reversed, on the law, without costs, motion granted, summary judgment awarded to defendant City of Kingston, and complaint and all cross claims dismissed against said defendant.

1478403,1478403,961658,United States v. McIntosh,"UNITED STATES of America, Plaintiff, v. James Byron McINTOSH, Defendant","

  AMENDED ORDER
 

  ABRAM, Chief United States Magistrate Judge.
 

  The matter which comes before this court is regarding the application for payment of fees submitted by Defense counsel.
 

  I. Facts
 

  Defendant was arrested on November 15, 1991 for possession with intent to distribute 265 grams of cocaine. Three days later, a private attorney was appointed. The Court stated “This appointment shall remain in effect until terminated by the Court or a substitute attorney is appointed.” (November 18, 1991 Order). On December 9, 1991, the charges against defendant were dismissed without prejudice, pending investigation and the possibility of a cooperation agreement. Appointed counsel served as negotiator and liaison between Defendant and the government during discussions of the possible agreement.
 

  The government and the Defendant reached an agreement on February 10, 1992, under which in return for work as a proactive participant in undercover operations, Defendant’s sentence would be accordingly reduced. In a December 6, 1991 letter from the Assistant United States Attorney to appointed counsel, the government’s position was outlined:
 

  “My present plans are to seek an indictment in early January. Based on the investigative information aggregated thus far, it appears that James Byron McIntosh could be charged with two distributions of crack cocaine (each to an undercover police officer) totalling approximately 45 grams, as well as distribution of powder cocaine charged in the criminal complaint.
 

  (December 6, 1991 letter from the Assistant United States Attorney to defense counsel). The letter indicated that the possible sentence for the two charges of distribution of crack cocaine that Assistant United States Attorney wished to pursue against the Defendant totaled a possible 13 years without parole. They planned on lowering the sentence to five years in return for Defendant’s cooperation. Defendant was given no assurances or promises, and the government reserved the right to decide the worth of Defendant’s assistance: “The determination as to the value of the cooperation ultimately rendered by McIntosh lies
  
   solely
  
  with the good faith discretion of the United States Attorney’s Office for the District of Colorado.”
  
   Id.
  


  Defendant, counsel and case agents periodically met to assess the progress of the cooperation agreement. Despite these meetings and pursuant to its reserved right, the government repudiated the cooperation agreement on or around April 1, 1992, citing Defendant’s lack of cooperation. Appointed counsel strenuously objected to the termination of the agreement, arguing that it was the government that impeded the success of the operation by not assigning the proper personnel to the case. Counsel charged that Defendant’s contacts refused to meet with a Caucasian drug buyer, and the government refused to assign an African-American agent to the case.
 

  Nevertheless, Defendant was again charged with possession with intent to distribute cocaine and the cooperation agreement was canceled. Appointed counsel remained in contact with Defendant until the middle of May, and Defendant has not been seen since. Because of the loss of contact, counsel withdrew from representing Defendant on August 12, 1992 and subsequently filed this application for attorney fees. The government does not oppose the motion.
 

  II. Analysis
 

  The propriety of paying fees to an attorney for work done after charges have been
   
   *762
   
  dismissed is a question of first impression in this jurisdiction. The Courts, however, have spoken often to the necessity of appointed counsel at all stages of the criminal process.
 

  The District of Columbia Circuit has stated that the appointment of counsel should occur early, to ensure that Defendant not incur extended and unwarranted pretrial incarceration and that counsel may procure release through bail or other procedures.
  
   Williams v. United States,
  
  394 F.2d 957, 959 (D.C.Cir.1968). Furthermore, courts agree that the focus of the appointment is to protect the constitutional rights of the indigent accused, not for the benefit of the attorney.
  
   United States v. Cook,
  
  628 F.Supp. 38, 41 (D.Colo.1985);
  
   United States v. Alexander,
  
  742 F.Supp. 54 (N.D.N.Y.1990).
 

  To protect the constitutional rights of the indigent accused, the appointment should be made before the indictment. In
  
   Williams,
  
  the court stated, “The importance of appointed counsel’s continuing to function actively on behalf of his client throughout the preindictment period cannot be overemphasized.”
  
   Williams v. United States,
  
  394 F.2d at 959. The Ninth Circuit has held that the public defender’s continued representation throughout a year-long preindictment period was proper, where counsel was pursuing an equitable motion to compel the return of his client’s seized firearms.
  
   United States v. Martinson,
  
  809 F.2d 1364, 1370 (9th Cir.1987). In
  
   Martinson,
  
  the government promised for over a year that an indictment would be forthcoming but never delivered on that promise. The circuit held that once validly appointed, counsel was “clearly justified” in continuing said representation.
  
   Id.
  


  Appointed counsel’s representation should continue from the defendant’s initial appearance through appeal, and the attorney’s services should be utilized at every stage of the proceedings.
  
   United States v. Dangdee,
  
  608 F.2d 807, 809 (9th Cir.1979).
  
   Dangdee
  
  involved the appointment of counsel under the Criminal Justice Act, and the court held that the very “design of the Act contemplates the early appointment of counsel whose services are to continue through every stage of the proceedings.”
  
   Id.
  
  Counsel’s responsibilities do not end when the verdict is announced or the sentence is imposed; the attorney is responsible for posttrial procedures and processes as well.
  
   Smotherman v. Beto,
  
  276 F.Supp. 579, 584 (N.D.Tex.1967).
 

  Indeed, the only way to terminate the appointment of a public defender is if the Federal Magistrate Judge or Court determines that the defendant is no longer indigent and can afford to retain counsel.
  
   United States v. Dangdee,
  
  608 F.2d at 809. The Ninth Circuit explained that “continued representation by appointed counsel on appeal is, in effect, ‘automatic’ unless a change in defendant’s financial situation renders him ineligible for continued representation.”
  
   Id.
  
  In this case, the appointment order directly stated that the appointment “shall remain in effect until terminated by the court or a substitute attorney is appointed.” (November 18, 1992 Order).
 

  Counsel in this case participated in the negotiation and continuation of the cooperation agreement between the defendant and the government. This representation took place between dismissal of the first indictment and the promised second indictment, and such representation is similar to that of an attorney’s role in plea bargaining. The Tenth Circuit has held that cooperation agreements and plea agreements are analogous and should be analyzed similarly.
  
   United States v. Pinter,
  
  971 F.2d 554 (10th Cir.1992). In
  
   Pinter,
  
  the defendant petitioned for reinstatement of the appeal that was dismissed pursuant to a cooperation agreement. Defendant claimed that the government breached the cooperation agreement.
  
   Id.
  
  at 557. Regarding the importance of cooperation agreements, the court stated:
 

  Cooperation agreements, like plea agreements, function as an “essential part” of the criminal justice process and are “highly desirable” as a means to assist law enforcement investigative efforts. Many plea agreements require some cooperation by defendants in ongoing investigations. Additionally, cooperation
   
   *763
   
  agreements like the one here often result in the surrender of valuable constitutional rights.
 


   Id.
  
  The United States Supreme Court has stated that failing to advise the defendant of his right to counsel during plea bargaining necessitates vacating the guilty plea.
  
   Santobello v. New York,
  
  404 U.S. 257, 265-266, 92 S.Ct. 495, 500-501, 30 L.Ed.2d 427 (1971);
  
   Walker v. Johnston,
  
  312 U.S. 275, 61 S.Ct. 574, 85 L.Ed. 830 (1941).
 

  The defendant in this case agreed to cooperate in return for a possible reduction in his sentence. Doing so, he surrendered valuable constitutional rights, such as the right not to incriminate himself and the right to counsel. This cooperation agreement, then, falls under the umbrella of
  
   Pinter
  
  and
  
   Santobello.
  
  Treating it as a plea agreement, the cooperation agreement necessitated the presence of counsel because of the surrender of constitutional rights involved. It is also helpful for an indigent defendant to understand the terms and ramifications of such an agreement.
 

  III. Conclusion
 

  The case law cited above clearly states that the appointment of counsel lasts throughout every stage of the proceedings, from initial appearance through appeal. The
  
   Pinter
  
  court asserted that cooperation agreements are an “essential part” of the criminal justice process. Therefore, the appointment of counsel was effective throughout the negotiation and continuation of the cooperation agreement.
 

  The only way to terminate this appointment was by court order, following a determination that the defendant was no longer indigent. The court never so ordered. The representation continued well into the summer, until August 12, 1992, when counsel resigned because he had lost contact with the defendant.
 

  The facts clearly indicate that the defendant was in need of representation during this time. A further indictment was promised, as in
  
   Martinson,
  
  and the government was seeking an eventual-five year prison sentence. The defendant was indigent and needed the terms and consequences of the agreement explained to him. And finally, because the appointment lasted through the cooperation agreement stages of the proceeding and was not terminated until August, long after the government had repudiated the agreement, the payment of attorney fees in this case is proper.
 

  IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the application for payment of fees submitted by Defense counsel is hereby GRANTED.

Juan Sanchez, individually, and as President of Chilili Cooperative Association, Inc., as President of La Merced del Pueblo de Chilili, and as Chairman of Chilili Land Grant Board of Trustees La Merced del Pueblo de Chilili and Board of Trustees of La Merced del Pueblo de Chilili, Group II: Unknown of Interest in the Premises Adverse to the"," OPINION ROBINSON, Judge. {1} The opinion filed in this case on July 8, 2003, is withdrawn and the following opinion is filed in its stead. The motion for rehearing is otherwise denied. {2} Defendants appeal one district court order granting partial summary judgment to quiet title to a certain parcel of land in favor of Plaintiff and one final judgment quieting title to certain roads in Plaintiff. Defendants raise five issues on appeal: (1) whether the district court erred in precluding by collateral estoppel the relitigation of Defendants’ argument that the Chilili Land Grant Board of Trustees (Board) lacks the power to sue and be sued, (2) whether the Board does possess the power to sue and be sued, (3) whether the heirs of the land grant are necessary parties to the action, (4) whether the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Plaintiff as to the parcel of land, and (5) whether the district court erred in quieting title to the roads in Plaintiff. We affirm. PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND {3} Plaintiff Shearton Development Co., LLC (Plaintiff) purchased property, known as Sundance Mountain Ranches (Sundance), at a foreclosure sale. Plaintiff filed a complaint seeking a quiet title decree for that property, damages for slander of title and trespass, ejectment, recovery of property, injunctive relief, and, alternatively, inverse condemnation. The first amended complaint named two sets of Defendants. Group I Defendants included the Town of Chihli Land Grant, various entities that have managed the Chilili Land Grant, and Juan Sanchez, who has headed each managing entity. This opinion refers to Group I Defendants collectively as “Defendants.” Group II Defendants were named as the “Unknown Claimants of Interest in the Premises Adverse to the Plaintiff.” The Group II Defendants failed to appear, plead, or otherwise defend the action, and the district court entered a final default judgment against them. {4} Defendants filed a motion to dismiss on the grounds that the district court did not have jurisdiction over them because the Chilili Land Grant’s creating statute, NMSA 1978, §§ 49^4-1 to -3 (1876, as amended through 1943), does not expressly confer upon the Board the power to sue or be sued. The district court denied Defendants’ motion to dismiss, finding that Defendants often invoke state court jurisdiction; that no appellate court has sua sponte denied jurisdiction over the Chihli Land Grant; and that the district court has jurisdiction over the Board, which has the power to sue and be sued on behalf of the Chilili Land Grant, a power necessarily implied from the express statutory grants of authority to pass ordinances and to sell and convey real property. {5} Plaintiff filed a motion for partial summary judgment to quiet title and, as alluded to earlier, for default judgment against the Group II Defendants. In its memorandum in support of summary judgment, Plaintiff sought to summarily quiet its title in what it simply calls “Shearton Property,” land which the complaint’s attached exhibits describe in terms of numbered lots and in metes and bounds. The district court entered a default judgment against the Group II Defendants and granted partial summary judgment to quiet title to the Shearton Property in Plaintiff, resolving several, but not all, of the claims contained in the complaint. {6} The district court’s judgment, among other things, resolved that it has jurisdiction over the subject matter and parties to the action; that collateral estoppel bars Defendants from relitigating the jurisdictional issues; that the heirs of the Chilili Land Grant are neither real parties in interest, nor necessary and proper parties; and that Plaintiff is the owner in fee simple and rightful possessor of the Shearton Property. In its order, the district court retained jurisdiction over the remaining counts set forth in Plaintiffs first amended complaint. {7} The hearing in Shearton Dev. Co. v. Chilili Land Grant, No. 22,441 (Shearton I) revealed that determining ownership of certain portions of the property was complicated by the fact that the parties were describing the property differently. Plaintiff used numbered lots and metes and bounds; Defendants used numbered tracts and maps. In addition to challenging Plaintiffs overall title to the Shearton Property, Defendants also claimed ownership of certain roads they described as Tract 8, Map 21, Tract 18, Map 26, and “portion[s] of Sundance Kid Road,” which Defendants believed were included in the property Plaintiff claimed to have purchased at the foreclosure sale. Although the partial summary judgment order quieted title in Plaintiff to virtually all of the Shearton Property, the district court did not grant summary judgment concerning the ownership of the roads allegedly within the Shear-ton Property, finding genuine issues of material fact that would require further argument at a separate hearing. While the partial summary judgment order did not resolve all outstanding claims, Defendants nevertheless filed a notice of appeal from the order granting partial summary judgment. See Shear-ton I. {8} Subsequently, the district court held a separate hearing to determine whether Plaintiffs title included the roads identified by Defendants as “portions of Sundance Kid Road,” Tract 8, Map 21, and Tract 18, Map 26. After hearing evidence and oral argument, the district court ruled that Plaintiff owned the roads and tracts in fee simple, and it retained jurisdiction over the remaining counts of Plaintiffs first amended complaint. Defendants then filed a second notice of appeal. See Shearton Dev. Co. v. Chilili Land Grant, No. 23,255 (Shearton II). Ultimately, the district court dismissed Plaintiffs remaining counts with prejudice. Now that all claims have been resolved below, we proceed to address the issues raised in Shearton I and Shearton II in this consolidated opinion. DISCUSSION A. Whether the Board Has the Power to Sue and Be Sued {9} In its reply to Defendants’ response to the motion for summary judgment in Shear-ton I, Plaintiff argued that a recent judgment from the district court collaterally estopped Defendants from arguing that the Board lacked the power to sue and be sued. The district court ruled that the doctrine of collateral estoppel barred Defendants from relitigating this issue, and that, even if it did not, the Board had the power to sue and be sued. {10} Defendants continue to raise their argument that the issue of whether the Board has the power to sue and be sued is a pure question of law to which the doctrine of collateral estoppel does not apply. However, because we conclude that the Board has the power to sue and be sued, we need not decide whether the prior conclusion of law on the identical issue can be collaterally binding on this subsequent case. {11} Defendants argue that the Board lacks the capacity to sue and be sued because the Board has only those powers expressly conferred to it by the Chilili Land Grant’s creating statute, Sections 49-4-1 to -3, and the statute does not enumerate the Board’s power to sue and be sued. In support of their argument, Defendants refer to Merrifield v. Buckner, 41 N.M. 442, 70 P.2d 896 (1937). In that case, our Court quieted title to certain lands in the Board, holding that because its creating statute did not grant the Board the power to sell or convey land nor could these powers be implied from those granted, all deeds conveyed by it were void. Id. at 447, 70 P.2d at 899. The Court further held that the general statutes providing for the management of community land grants, which confer the power to sell and convey real property, do not apply to Chilili since the legislature had already prescribed its powers. Id. Six years after this case was handed down, the legislature amended the statute to include among the Board’s powers the authority to sell and convey real property. See 1943 N.M. Laws, ch. 47 § 1.  {12} In the case at hand, the district court, in its order denying Defendants’ motion to dismiss, concluded that the Board’s power to sue and be sued is necessarily implied from the express legislative grant of authority to pass ordinances and to sell and convey real property. We agree. {13} Although it is not incorporated, the Board is a legally recognized entity designated by statute to act on behalf of the people of Chihli and has the capacity to sue by implication. See Brown v. United States, 276 U.S. 134, 141, 48 S.Ct. 288, 72 L.Ed. 500 (1928) (recognizing that absence of a statutory provision allowing an unincorporated association the capacity to sue and be sued is not always determinative because a suit may be maintained against such an association by virtue of a necessary implication arising from the pertinent statutes); see also 6 Am.Jur.2d Associations and Clubs § 52 (1999). In Brown, the United States Supreme Court held that the provisions of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act proscribing criminal and civil liability for contracts made in a conspiracy to restrain interstate and foreign trade created an implication that a voluntary, unincorporated association may be prosecuted and sued in its common name. Brown, 276 U.S. at 141—42, 48 S.Ct. 288; see also Teubert v. Wis. Interscholastic Athletic Ass’n, 8 Wis.2d 373, 99 N.W.2d 100, 101-02 (1959) (affirming the denial of an athletic association’s motion to dismiss the action for its lack of capacity to be sued, holding that although the unincorporated entity’s creating statute did not by its terms grant the power to sue and be sued, the association’s power to contract and borrow money in its own name implied the legal obligation to become liable on its contracts and debts). {14} In this case, the creating statute allowing the Board to sell and convey land necessarily implies that the Board be able to assert its title to real property as the sole title holder. Further, the quiet title statute states that “[a]n action to determine and quiet the title of real property may be brought ... against any person or persons, claiming title” NMSA 1978, § 42-6-1 (1951); cf. Rule 1-017(A) NMRA 2003 (requiring that a suit be brought by the real party in interest). Because the Board claims an ownership interest in the property in which Plaintiff seeks to quiet title, the Board is necessarily vulnerable to the process of the district court. Cf. Maestas v. Bd. of Trs., 103 N.M. 77, 79, 703 P.2d 174, 176 (1985) (stating that “the Board should be held accountable in state court” for the failure to follow its own rules in a uniform and nondiscriminatory manner). {15} If we were to accept Defendants’ argument, then the Board would enjoy a form of sovereign immunity, conferred to no other board of a land grant and rivaled only by the broad immunity of our state and federal governments. Such a holding would be an absurdity, Brown, 276 U.S. at 142, 48 S.Ct. 288, and we refuse to interpret statutes to create an absurd result. Chavez v. Mountain States Constructors, 1996-NMSC-070, ¶ 24, 122 N.M. 579, 929 P.2d 971 (“we will avoid any literal interpretation that leads to an absurd or unreasonable result”). B. Whether the Heirs of the Land Grant are Necessary Parties to the Suit {16} Having determined that the Board has the capacity to sue and be sued, we next consider whether the district court erred in concluding that the heirs of the land grant were not necessary parties to the action. The district court’s jurisdictional and procedural ruling is a legal conclusion, which we review de novo. See Martinez v. Segovia, 2003-NMCA-023, ¶ 9, 133 N.M. 240, 62 P.3d 331.  {17} To conclude that the heirs are mandatory parties needed for a just adjudication in this suit, Defendants must establish: (1) that the heirs are necessary to the litigation; (2) that joinder is possible; and (3) that if joinder is not possible, the heirs are indispensable, such that, “in equity and good conscience,” the litigation should be dismissed. See Gallegos v. Pueblo of Tesuque, 2002-NMSC-012, ¶ 39, 132 N.M. 207, 46 P.3d 668 (quoting Rule 1-019(A),(B) NMRA 2003). {18} To support their argument on appeal, Defendants equate the land grant with a trust and the unnamed heirs with the beneficiaries of a trust, and rely on a 1950 annotation to argue that beneficiaries are generally necessary parties. W.W. Allen, Annotation, Trust Beneficiaries as Necessary Parties to Action Relating to Trust or its Property, 9 A.L.R.2d 10,1950 WL 7093 (1950).  {19} First, our Supreme Court has already determined that the Town of Chilili, through the Board, holds title to grant land “unburdened with any trust for heirs.” Moya v. Chilili Coop. Ass’n, 87 N.M. 99, 102, 529 P.2d 1220, 1223 (1974). The Court explained that the individual residents of the Chilili Land Grant of 1841 obtained no property interest in the common lands by the 1909 patent from the United States. Id. at 101-02, 529 P.2d at 1222-23. Therefore, it follows that the heirs of those individual residents also have no interest in the common lands, and cannot be regarded as beneficiaries of a trust. Thus, to the extent that Defendants base their argument on the heirs’ status as beneficiaries, the heirs of the land grant cannot be necessary and indispensable to this litigation involving land.  {20} Even assuming that the land grant is a trust and the heirs the beneficiaries, the heirs would not be necessary parties because this Court rejected the earlier rule found in the annotation, and has held that beneficiaries of a trust are not generally necessary parties. Armendaris Water Dev. Co. v. Rainwater, 109 N.M. 71, 74, 781 P.2d 799, 802 (Ct.App.1989). In Armendaris, this Court adopted the proposition that “the trustee may represent the beneficiary as in all actions relating to the trust, if rights of the beneficiary against the trustee, or the rights of the beneficiaries among themselves, are not brought into question.” Id. at 74, 781 P.2d at 802 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Consistent with this opinion, the Board may represent the Town of Chilili Land Grant in this quiet title suit, and may do so as the sole title holder to the common property, without the heirs, by virtue of the Board’s principal function'—to “hold title to and manage common lands.” Moya, 87 N.M. at 103, 529 P.2d at 1224 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Indeed, Defendants have never claimed that their role in this quiet title action is contrary to the interests of the hems or that the hems have competing interests that Defendants are incapable of representing. Accordingly, we hold that the district court properly concluded that the hems of the land grant are not necessary and indispensable parties to this action. C. Whether Genuine Issues of Material Fact Precluded Partial Summary Judgment {21} Defendants assert that the following three claims created factual disputes as to material facts, which should have precluded the entry of partial summary judgment: (1) that Defendants have an interest in the Shearton Property “by way of attempted purchase” at the foreclosure sale, (2) that a prior quitclaim deed conveyed to Defendants some right, title, or interest in the property, and (3) that the Defendants claim ownership of the roads within the Shearton Property subdivision. “Summary judgment is appropriate where there are no genuine issues of material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The issue on appeal is whether [Plaintiff] was entitled to [judgment] as a matter of law. We review these legal questions de novo.” Self v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 1998-NMSC-046, ¶ 6, 126 N.M. 396, 970 P.2d 582.  {22} First, Defendants assert that their claimed interest in the Shearton Property by way of attempted purchase at the foreclosure sale, where Plaintiff bought the property from Sundance, established a genuine issue of disputed material fact precluding the entry of summary judgment. In particular, Defendants maintained below that they were entitled to notice of the foreclosure sale, but did not receive adequate notice. As a result, Defendants contend they were improperly precluded from attempting to purchase the Shearton Property at the foreclosure sale. However, defense counsel admitted at the summary judgment hearing that Defendants’ challenge to the foreclosure sale was raised in an improper forum and was an improper collateral attack on the foreclosure judgment. In re Estate of Baca, 95 N.M. 294, 296-97, 621 P.2d 511, 513-14 (1980) (reaffirming the rule that permits a judgment to be collaterally attacked only upon a finding that the judging court lacked jurisdiction such that the judgment was void); Ballew v. Denson, 63 N.M. 370, 372-73, 320 P.2d 382, 383 (1958). Because defense counsel conceded that this action was an improper forum and because there is no indication that Defendants challenge the jurisdiction of the court that approved the foreclosure sale, we hold that the district court properly found that Defendants’ challenge to the foreclosure sale did not present a genuine issue of material fact, precluding summary judgment. See DeMatteo v. Simon, 112 N.M. 112, 114, 812 P.2d 361, 363 (Ct.App.1991) (finding that the defendants failed to preserve and “waived any right to complain of the trial court’s alleged error” in admitting evidence when they conceded at trial that certain evidence was admissible).  {23} Second, Defendants assert that the district court erred when it found that Defendants presented no issue of disputed fact when they asserted a claim to the Shear-ton Property on a prior quitclaim deed from the Gonzales family. Defendants attempted to create a factual dispute by submitting an affidavit which stated that the deed quit-claimed all the Gonzales’s interest to the Chilili Land Grant. However, the affidavit attested to the deed’s mere existence rather than to its legal effect. Moreover, the validity of the Gonzales quitclaim deed has already been adjudicated in Gonzales v. Gutierrez, No. CV-84-01778 (Bernalillo County District Court, Sept. 2, 1994), which concluded that the Gonzaleses had no right, title, or interest in the real property at issue in this case. Therefore, Defendants failed to establish a factual issue because the legal effect of the deed was already determined in a prior lawsuit and is not subject to collateral attack. See City of Socorro v. Cook, 24 N.M. 202, 204, 173 P. 682, 684 (1918) (holding that the judgment as to the title in a prior litigation was not subject to collateral attack and the question of right to title is res judicata). {24} Third, Defendants argue that there were genuine issues of material fact as to the ownership of the roads within the Shearton Property subdivision. However, Defendants appear to be confused by the issues actually determined by the order of partial summary judgment. The district court forbade the parties from fully developing testimony and argument as to ownership of the roads in the summary judgment hearing after realizing that material facts were still in dispute. At the hearing, the district court determined that Plaintiff successfully quieted its title to the land, which the parties described by different forms of measurement, and which may or may not have included the disputed roads. Because Defendants believed that the property Plaintiff described in its first amended complaint contained at least one tract of land in which Defendants claimed an interest, and because Plaintiff did not agree that any of the tracts were physically located within the property, the district court discovered a factual dispute precluding its resolution at the hearing on Plaintiffs motion for partial summary judgment. {25} Consequently, the district court held a second hearing to develop the disputed facts and render its judgment as to the location and ownership of the roads. Accordingly, we deal with the merits of Defendants’ claim below. D. Whether the District Court Erred in Quieting Title to the Roads in Plaintiff i. The Chain of Title {26} Plaintiff contends that the property involved in this case, what Plaintiff calls “Shearton Property,” is a portion of a larger tract of land known as the Townsend Brothers Property and is located within the original boundaries of the Town of Chilili Land Grant. The Townsend Brothers Property is comprised of three parcels: (1) the Mistretta Parcel, (2) the Barela Parcel, and (3) the Chilili Parcel. The property specifically disputed in these cases was found to be located in the Mistretta Parcel. {27} The Townsend Brothers acquired the Mistretta Parcel by warranty deed from Mr. and Mrs. Mistretta in 1966, who, in the same year, quieted their title in the parcel against the Board and the Chilili Cooperative Association, among others, in Mistretta v. Group I Board of Trustees of the Chilili Land Grant, No. A17264 (Bernalillo County District Court, August 26, 1966). Thereafter, the Townsend Brothers conveyed by warranty deed portions of the Mistretta Parcel to Sun-dance. {28} In 1988, in Chilili Cooperative Ass’n v. Sundance Mountain Ranches, Inc., No. CV-85-0919 (Bernalillo County District Court, Oct. 3, 1988), the district court granted Sundance partial summary judgment after Chilili Cooperative Association failed to establish any right, title, or interest in the Mistretta Parcel. In that case, the district court ruled that Chilili Land Grant acquired no right to the land from the Gonzales quitclaim deed, because the deed was declared null and void in Gonzales v. Gutierrez, No. CV-85-01778. All claims on behalf of the Chilili Cooperative Association in the 1988 lawsuit against Sundance were subsequently dismissed with prejudice. At a foreclosure sale, Plaintiff purchased part, if not all, of the Mistretta Parcel from Sundance, and, in 1996, acquired title by special master’s deed. {29} Defendants do not challenge that the Townsend Brothers acquired title to the three parcels, including the Mistretta Parcel, which Defendants acknowledge was quieted in the Townsend Brothers in the 1966 title suit. Further, Defendants do not dispute that Sundance acquired the Shearton Property, which Plaintiff purchased. Defendants claim that certain tracts of land within the property Plaintiff claims were portions of the original land grant that were never conveyed out of Chilili. In support of their claim, Defendants submitted affidavits claiming that in 1944, in Chilili Cooperative Ass’n v. Armenia, No. 31,665 (Bernalillo County District Court, Nov. 3, 1944), the Chilili Cooperative Association quieted its title to the land within the existing boundaries of the Chilili Land Grant, including the roads at issue in this case. Finally, Defendants complete their claimed chain of title with a 1989 quitclaim deed, by which the Chilili Cooperative Association conveyed land, including the disputed tracts, to the Board. ii. Quieting Title to the Roads {30} Defendants argue that the disputed roads were not specifically designated in Plaintiffs chain of title, beginning with the Mistretta Parcel quiet title decree. To support their argument, Defendants make much of Plaintiffs initial position at the hearing in Shearton I, in which Plaintiff did not believe that the disputed tracts were within the Shearton Property. Defendants, however, fail to acknowledge that the district court expressly refused to make findings as to the location and ownership of the tracts in Shear-ton I, indicating that it did not consider Plaintiffs position conclusive. Further, the district court clearly stated in its Shearton II judgment that Plaintiffs initial position was not conclusive. We find no error in the district court’s refusal to consider Plaintiffs initial belief as an admission or concession of any kind. {31} Aside from arguing that Plaintiff conceded that it had no interest in the disputed roads, Defendants also argue that Plaintiff failed to demonstrate that the roads were described within the documents comprising Plaintiffs chain of title. Plaintiff argues that although there was no title record describing the disputed roads in the specific numbered tracts used by Defendants, the roads were actually within the metes and bounds description in the Mistretta Parcel quiet title decree, which quieted title in Plaintiffs predecessor in interest and to which Defendants were bound. In support of its contention, Plaintiff presented the unrebutted testimony of Timothy Oden, an expert surveyor, who physically and mathematically tracked the metes and bounds description in the Mistretta Parcel quiet title decree, and found that the disputed roads were contained in that description. After weighing the evidence, the district court found that the disputed roads were, in fact, within the metes and bounds description set forth in the Mistretta Parcel quiet title decree.  {32} Defendants argue that when most of the evidence is documentary, the standard of review is de novo. Defendants’ argument, however, overlooks that the district court relied on the surveyor’s testimony to decide a question of fact. We review this finding for substantial evidence. See Pucci Distrib. Co. v. Nellos, 110 N.M. 374, 377, 796 P.2d 595, 598 (1990) (engaging in substantial evidence review after refusing to ignore testimonial evidence presented and focus solely on certain documents). “Substantial evidence is such relevant evidence that a reasonable mind would find adequate to support a conclusion.” Landavazo v. Sanchez, 111 N.M. 137, 138, 802 P.2d 1283, 1284 (1990).  {33} Because the district court relied on Plaintiffs expert testimony, we hold that substantial evidence supports the district court’s finding that the disputed tracts are, in fact, contained within the metes and bounds description in Plaintiffs chain of title. See Lamkin v. Garcia, 106 N.M. 60, 62, 738 P.2d 932, 934 (Ct.App.1987) (affirming fact-finder’s reliance on unrebutted testimony). {34} Defendants argue that even if the tracts are within the metes and bounds descriptions, the preamble of the Mistretta Parcel quiet title decree reflects the parties’ intentional omission of the disputed tracts and controls over the metes and bounds descriptions. The preamble contains several lists of numbered tracts, which do not include those tracts that Defendants argue contain the disputed roads. The lists of tracts are followed by explanations stating that “[t]he real estate aforesaid being more particularly described by metes and bounds as follows, to-wit.” It is within those metes and bounds descriptions that the district court found that the roads were actually located. {35} Plaintiff argues that by its own terms the preamble reflects an intention to more particularly describe the property in metes and bounds, and that the more specific description controls over a conflicting general one. Again, the district court ruled in favor of Plaintiff, concluding that the parties to the Mistretta Parcel quiet title decree intended to include the disputed roads, and did so in the more specific metes and bounds legal descriptions of the title’s metes and bounds, not its preamble. {36} On appeal, Defendants misrepresent the testimony of the surveyor, alleging that he testified to the parties’ intentional omission of the tracts from the decree’s description. Rather, the surveyor clarified that the omission may have been accidental or intentional, concluding that he did not have an opinion about it. Defendants did not offer any evidence of the parties’ intentions in describing the property both in tracts and in metes and bounds. As a result, the district court was free to disregard counsel’s argument that the parties intended that the tract numbers in the preamble would control. See Durham v. S.W. Developers Joint Venture, 2000-NMCA-010, ¶ 44, 128 N.M. 648, 996 P.2d 911 (stating that issues involving intent generally involve questions of fact); see also In re Application of Metro. Invs., Inc., 110 N.M. 436, 441, 796 P.2d 1132, 1137 (Ct.App.1990) (stating that “arguments of counsel are not evidence” and cannot establish facts).  {37} Without extrinsic evidence of the parties’ intentions, the district court construed the face of the decree, and concluded that the specific metes and bounds descriptions control the general descriptions found in the preamble of the decree. We agree with the district court’s construction and follow the well-established rule of law that the more specific description of the property will prevail over a conflicting general description, in order to arrive more closely at the intentions of the parties. See Iselin v. C.W. Hunter Co., 173 F.2d 388, 393 (5th Cir.1949) (holding that the description by metes and bounds will control an inconsistent general description in a deed); Jordan v. Tinnin, 342 So.2d 748, 753 (Ala.1977) (applying principle to deed construction); Hancock v. Planned Dev. Corp., 791 P.2d 183, 185 (Utah 1990) (recognizing the rule of law, but noting that it will not control when the intentions of the parties are otherwise); 12 Am.Jur.2d Boundaries § 60 (1997); 23 Am.Jur.2d Deeds § 249 (1997). {38} Accordingly, we hold that the district court properly quieted title to the disputed roads in Plaintiff. CONCLUSION {39} For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court’s grant of partial summary judgment quieting title to the Shearton Property in Plaintiff. We also affirm the district court’s judgment quieting title to the roads in Plaintiff. {40} IT IS SO ORDERED. WE CONCUR: LYNN PICKARD and RODERICK T. KENNEDY, Judges. "
9318428,9323119,66603467,Cousins v. Sharon City School District,Cousins v. Sharon City School District,"
WHERRY, J.,
This matter is currently before the court on defendant’s1 motion for summary judgment. Following excellent briefing of the issues by counsel, oral argument of equal quality was had. At this argument, counsel for defendant requested and received permission to submit supplemental material for the court’s consideration. Plaintiff’s counsel was given an opportunity to respond in kind and availed himself of it. With all of this material now submitted, this opinion, and the order which follows, shall dispose *320of this motion and explain the reasoning behind the court’s decision.
Insofar as the facts and law are closely interwoven in a motion for summary judgment, a fairly thorough review of the facts surrounding this case is in order. It is well known that, in considering a motion for summary judgment, the trial court must review the record in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. DeWeese v. Anchor Hocking Consumer and Industrial Products Group, 427 Pa. Super. 47, 628 A.2d 421 (1993). Accordingly, the factual recitation in this opinion shall reflect as favorably upon the plaintiffs’ submission of the facts as the pleadings allow.
I.
This case arose from a slip and fall accident that occurred in the adjoining parking lot area of Sharon High School and Sharon Elementary School in Sharon, Mercer County, Pennsylvania. Plaintiff2 was attending a wrestling tournament at Sharon High School on April 8, 1988, and the automobile she arrived in was parked in the parking lot of Sharon Elementary School at approximately 5 p.m. The elementary school lot directly adjoins the lot of the high school, with the high school itself on the other side of its parking lot going away from the elementary lot. When plaintiff entered the high school, it was raining or misting, and the parking lot was wet.
At approximately 9:15 p.m., plaintiff left the tournament accompanied by her son and daughter. Plaintiff intended to drive home in her husband’s van, which *321was also parked in the elementary school lot. In walking back towards the lot, plaintiff and her children traversed the same path plaintiff had taken going into the high school. This involved leaving the gymnasium and walking across the high school parking lot to the point where a fenced divider separates the high school and elementary parking lots.
At some point along the fence, there was an open gate. The high school parking lot sits at a slightly higher elevation than does the elementary lot, and this is apparent where the two lots meet at the fence. On the ground where the gate is, there is an irregular hump of varying elevations and slopes which is composed of various paving materials, apparently placed there in some effort to “bridge” the two lots. The temperature had dropped five to 10 degrees and the rain or mist had turned to snow by the time plaintiff and her children approached, and the hump at the gateway was covered with a light dusting of snow. Plaintiff slipped at one point while traversing the high school parking lot, but she did not fall and proceeded onward. Plaintiff declined an offer of assistance from her son at that point, recognizing that his stride was different than hers and reasoning that if he slipped, he might pull her down with him.
When they came to the gateway and its hump, plaintiff and her children sought to cross over the hump onto the elementary school lot. Plaintiff grabbed a low masonry wall with one hand and a pole attached to the fence with the other. She then stepped on the hump with her left foot and slowly stepped down on the hump with her right foot. As plaintiff transferred her weight onto her right foot, that foot slipped and her legs went up in the air. She fell quickly to the ground, striking her head very hard upon the hump itself.
*322As a result of this fall, plaintiff allegedly suffered numerous injuries for which she has received medical treatment. Most significant among these is an ongoing form of epilepsy manifesting itself in grand mal seizures. Plaintiff has also experienced some loss of memory and cognitive ability which is allegedly related to the head injuries she sustained in the fall. In addition, plaintiff is taking medication to control her seizures and for pain associated with chronic headaches which persist to this day. This medication, either alone or in conjunction with her injuries, may also have contributed to the memory problems plaintiff has experienced.
II.
Plaintiff contends that defendant was negligent in a number of ways which were substantial factors in causing her injuries. Specifically, plaintiff’s complaint3 avers, among other things, that defendant was negligent in failing to remove the hump, in failing to warn about or illuminate the hump, in failing to take measures to keep the hump free of snow and ice, and in failing to discover and/or eliminate the condition caused by snow and ice accumulation on the hump. (Amended complaint at paragraph 18.)4
Defendant’s answer and new matter denies any negligence and raises the defenses of assumption of the risk, comparative negligence, governmental immunity, and other defenses. Following discovery, defendant filed the instant motion, reasserting its immunity from suit pursuant to the Local Government Immunity Act. The *323basis for this position is that plaintiff’s claim was based on the slippery conditions and that defendant was not responsible for a surface which was merely slippery. Alternatively, defendant reiterates, recovery is barred because plaintiff assumed the risk of injury by continuing to walk through the parking lot even though she knew it was slippery by virtue of her initial slip.
Plaintiff’s response to defendant’s motion first asserts that an exception to the Local Government Immunity Act applies, specifically the “real property” exception. Under this exception, plaintiff contends, liability may lie against defendant for the negligent maintenance of real property under its care, custody or control, that property being the hump between the schools’ parking lots. Plaintiff also denies assumption of risk, contending that there was no other path to her car she could have taken which was safer.
In support of her opposition to defendant’s motion, plaintiff submitted her own affidavit and that of her daughter, Michelle Cousins, along with an expert report from Dr. Irving J. Oppenheim, a professional engineer. The substance of the affidavits relates certain of the facts which have been summarized above. The purpose of submitting these affidavits appears to be to correct or clarify certain testimony given by plaintiff during her deposition.5 The engineering expert was proffered to help establish the theory that the hump at the gateway *324would have posed a danger and likelihood of a fall even had conditions not been wet or snowy. The report stated in essence that the hump was so irregular and of such severe grades that it was an inherent hazard which defendant could and should have remedied in one or more ways.
Defendant in response filed a motion to strike affidavits.6 In its motion, defendant contends that the affidavits submitted are an improper means of rebutting summary judgment in this instance because plaintiff’s deposition is a pleading which cannot be rescinded or modified via affidavit. Plaintiff responded to the motion to strike by stating that a deposition is not a pleading and hence there is no improper rebuttal. Also, plaintiff contends that she is merely clarifying matters in her deposition, matters which she admitted at the time of deposition might be unclear due to her injuries and/or medication.
III.
The standards for evaluating a motion for summary judgment stem from the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure. Pa.R.C.P. 1035. In evaluating a case for summary judgment, a court must view the record in a light most favorable to the non-moving party, with all doubts as to the existence of material fact being resolved against the moving party. Hayward v. Medical Center of Beaver County, 530 Pa. 320, 608 A.2d 1040 (1992). The ultimate issue in deciding a motion for summary judgment is whether the evidence available, examined most favorably to the non-moving party, in*325dicates whether a prima facie case exists. Johnson v. Harris, 419 Pa. Super. 541, 615 A.2d 771 (1992). Once a motion for summary judgment has been made and properly supported by the moving party, it is then incumbent upon the non-moving party to demonstrate by interrogatories, admissions, or affidavits that a genuine issue of material fact exists for trial. Marks v. Tasman, 527 Pa. 132, 589 A.2d 205 (1991).
In examining defendant’s motion, the initial question to evaluate pursuant to the standards set forth is the applicability of the Local Government Immunity Act. 42 Pa.C.S. §8541. Under the Act, local agenices7 are generally immune from suit for damages deriving from personal injuries. Id. Nonetheless, a local agency may be liable for personal injury damages if a cause of action would otherwise exist against a person not having an immunity defense available, the actions of the agency or its agents or employees caused the injury, and one of eight enumerated exceptions to the immunity applied. 42 Pa.C.S. §8542.
Plaintiff in this case contends that there is no immunity available to defendant in this case due to the “real property” exception. This exception is defined as follows:
“(b) Acts which may impose liability. — The following acts by a local agency or any of its employees may result in the imposition of liability on a local agency:...
*326“(3) Real property. — The care, custody or control of real property in the possession of the local agency, except that the local agency shall not be liable for damages on account of any injury sustained by a person intentionally trespassing on real property in the possession of the local agency.” 42 Pa.C.S. §8542(b)(3).
Clearly the parking lot areas in their entirety constitute real property, and there is no dispute as to defendant’s ownership and control over it.
It has been held that the “duty of care a Commonwealth agency owes to those using its real estate is such as to require that the condition of the property is safe for the activities for which it is regularly used, intended to be used, or reasonably foreseen to be used.” Bendas v. Township of White Deer, 531 Pa. 180, 183, 611 A.2d 1184, 1186 (1992) (quoting Snyder v. Harmon, 522 Pa. 424, 435, 562 A.2d 307, 312 (1989)). Should that duty be breached and the land contain a defect, damages may only be recovered if the defect itself causes injury. The exception will not apply if the defect simply facilitates or exacerbates an act of another party who falls outside the exception. Norwin School District v. Cortazzo, 155 Pa. Commw. 432, 625 A.2d 183 (1993).
There can be no real question that plaintiff, at the time of her fall, was on defendant’s premises as an invitee. She was attending a wrestling tournament held at the high school and was parked in one of the parking lots along with others attending the event. Plaintiff therefore is not precluded from recovery by reason of unlawful trespass. 42 Pa.C.S. §8542(b)(3). Therefore, the critical question to be answered is, “could the real estate at issue, namely the hump at the gateway, have caused plaintiff’s injury without any facilitating factors?”
Defendant contends that plaintiff’s pleadings and deposition preclude an affirmative answer. At all times *327relevant, defendant submits that plaintiff claimed she slipped and fell on the ice and/or snow that had recently fallen. Since defendant has no obligation to keep its lots free of a light, natural snowfall, defendant reasons that immunity will apply for two reasons. First, since there was no duty to begin with, there can be no breach of duty. Secondly, the existence of snow and ice does not constitute a defect in real estate which would warrant the exception enumerated in the statute.
Defendant’s contention misses a significant point. The foundation of its motion is the assumption that plaintiff is alleging her fall was caused by the slippery condition of the hump due to ice and snow only. The ice and snow certainly were mentioned, and prominently, in plaintiff’s pleadings. However, the ice and snow did not stand alone. Much was made of the condition of the hump itself in the complaint. In averring the particulars of defendant’s alleged negligence, plaintiff included the following:
“(b) In failing to warn or give notice of the dangerous condition which existed in the area of the hump;
“(c) In failing to remove the hump;
“(d) In failing to install, construct and erect handrails adjacent to and in the area of the hump for use by pedestrians in traveling it;
“(e) In failing to properly illuminate the parking lot areas of the premises and, in particular, the gateway between these parking lots where the hump existed;...
“(g) In failing to paint or otherwise mark the hump in such a way as to call the attention of pedestrians traversing it to its existence;...
“(j) In failing to provide adequate and appropriate drainage in the area where plaintiff Cathy I. Cousins fell;
*328“(k) In constructing the hump in the area of the gateway between the parking lots of the premises in an area over which pedestrians were to travel between the parking areas;
“(1) In failing to place a roof or other covering over the hump to prevent the accumulation of rain, ice and snow on it;
“(m) In failing to place hot water pipes or other devices within or under the hump for the purpose of heating it to prevent the accumulation of ice and snow upon it; and,
“(n) In failing to provide a flat, level means of ingress and egress between the parking lot areas of the premises.” (Amended complaint at paragraph 18.)
The only subparagraphs not recited here, those having anything to do with ice and snow, numbered four out of 14. It is clear from that majority of the subparagraphs cited above that plaintiff is alleging the condition of the hump was a cause of her fall. Indeed, the opinion of plaintiff’s engineering expert, Dr. Oppenheim, suggests that the hump would be hazardous “under any conditions, including dry conditions....” (Expert report of Irving J. Oppenheim at 4.) (emphasis added)
Defendant, in its supplemental motion to quash affidavits, suggests that plaintiff also restricted herself through her subsequent testimony to the position that the ice and snow covering the hump made her fall. Specifically, defendant points to portions of plaintiff’s deposition as well as paragraph 16 of the amended complaint. Paragraph 16 avers:
“On April 8,1988, at approximately 9:15 p.m., plaintiff Cathy I. Cousins exited the Sharon High School building, walked across the Sharon High School parking lot and was walking from the Sharon High School park*329ing lot through the gateway between it and the Sharon Elementary School parking lot where she had parked her van in order to leave the premises when she stepped upon the large, lumpy, irregular hump, which was covered with ice and freezing rain causing her to slip and fall, thereby sustaining severe and permanent personal injuries.” (Supplemental brief of defendant at 2.) (citing amended complaint, paragraph 16.)
While it is true that the words “covered with ice and freezing rain” immediately preceded “causing her to slip and fall” in this particular paragraph, the complaint must be read as a whole. This paragraph, in conjunction with the subparagraphs in paragraph 18, potentially makes out a theory of recovery which finds fault with the hump itself, with or without snow and ice. Indeed, the contents of this particular paragraph could be construed as indicating that the “large, lumpy, irregular” condition of the hump combined with “ice and freezing rain” caused plaintiff’s fall. This is borne out by subparagraphs 1 and m of paragraph 18, set out above, which suggest that the hump, because of its irregular construction, should be shielded or protected in some way from the elements. This position is also set forth in Dr. Oppenheim’s expert report. (Expert report of Irving J. Oppenheim at 4.)
With respect to the statements contained in plaintiff’s deposition that she “slipped and fell on the ice covering the hump” or words to that effect, this is not necessarily dispositive of the issue. Defendant submits that plaintiff’s deposition statements are judicial admissions that the snow and ice caused the fall, and that these admissions cannot be retracted or modified by subsequent affidavit. Plaintiff attacks this position on two grounds. First, plaintiff contends that the deposition statements are not judicial admissions. Secondly, plaintiff insists *330that the statements are not contradictory, and that any appearance thereof is due to the memory problems she was having at the time her deposition was taken.
Judicial admissions are admissions which are made in pleadings, stipulations, etc., which do not have to be proved in the same litigation. Giannone v. U.S. Steel Corp., 238 F.2d 544, 547 (3rd Cir. 1956). More specifically, judicial admissions are express waivers made in court or in preparation for trial by a party in order to concede for trial purposes the truth of the admission. It has the effect of a confessory pleading, in that the fact is thereafter to be taken for granted, so that the opposing party need offer no evidence to prove it and the party by whom the statement was made is not allowed to disprove it. Jewelcor Jewelers & Distributors Inc. v. Corr, 373 Pa. Super. 536, 542, 542 A.2d 72, 75 (1988). Of significance in the instant case, “[a] principal element of a judicial admission is that the fact has been admitted for the advantage of the admitting party, and consequently, a judicial admission cannot be subsequently contradicted by the party that made it.” Nasim v. Shamrock Welding Supply Co., 387 Pa. Super. 225, 228, 563 A.2d 1266, 1267 (1989). (emphasis added)
A judicial admission need not be strictly a pleading; more important than the form is the intent of the party making it, as set forth supra. Nasim, supra at 229, 563 A.2d at 1268. Depositions, however, are sworn testimony of a deponent. Any statement constituting a judicial admission would have to be explicit and unequivocal by the deponent. In several instances, statements made by party deponents which appear dispositive of all or part of the ultimate issue in a case have been held, not to constitute judicial admissions. See Videon Chevrolet Inc. v. General Motors Corp., 992 F.2d 482 (3rd Cir. 1993); Thomas v. Hutchinson, 442 Pa. 118, *331275 A.2d 23 (1971). Such material may be utilized at trial as either substantive evidence or to impeach the deponent. Nonetheless, it is not binding, and is instead a matter for a finder of fact to evaluate the weight the deposition statements should be given. Videon Chevrolet, supra 992 F.2d at 488 n.5.
In the instant case, plaintiff’s deposition statements concerning ice and snow being the cause of her fall are somewhat limited. They were almost never made without some reference to the hump at the same time. Clearly there was no intention to admit for trial that the ice and snow was solely responsible for the fall and that the hump was in no way responsible — to suggest that there was would obviate the need for plaintiff’s extensive averments and discovery about the condition of the hump itself. Such a suggestion flies in the face of common sense and falls well short of the standard that must be met for a motion for summary judgment. It certainly would not be made for the benefit of plaintiff at trial. Accordingly, these statements do not constitute judicial admissions, and defendant’s motion to quash affidavits based upon this premise will be denied.8
IV.
Defendant’s motion for summary judgment also contends that plaintiff assumed the risk of falling by taking *332the route she did over a condition (the icy hump) she knew to be hazardous. As plaintiff correctly points out, defendant’s contention can best be described as what has been termed the “alternate ways” or “choice of ways” doctrine. Simply put, this doctrine states: “Where a person, having a choice of two ways, one of which is perfectly safe, and the other of which is subject to risks and dangers, voluntarily chooses the latter and is injured, he is guilty of contributory negligence and cannot recover.” Downing v. Shaffer, 246 Pa. Super. 512, 518, 371 A.2d 953, 956 (1977). (citations omitted) In order for the choice of ways doctrine to be applicable:
“[Tjhere must be evidence that the plaintiff made an unreasonable decision which exposed him to a hazard that he knew or should have known existed. There must be evidence of (1) a safe course, (2) a dangerous course, and (3) facts which would put a reasonable person on notice of the danger or actual knowledge of the danger.” Id. at 519, 371 A.2d at 956.
Very rarely is choice of ways an issue which is dealt with at summary judgment. The cases which have examined it have generally been at the post-trial stage. Even in those cases, however, “Pennsylvania courts have generally been loath to apply the alternate ways doctrine.... [I]n those very few cases where the doctrine has been applied to find that the plaintiff was contributorily negligent, the danger the plaintiff chose to confront was indisputably obvious.” O ’Brien v. Martin, 432 Pa. Super. 323, 328, 638 A.2d 247, 249 (1994).
In the instant case, defendant is contending that plaintiff’s deposition reveals she knew another way back to her vehicle which would have avoided the gateway and hump and nonetheless chose to traverse the hump. This is true to an extent. In response to questioning by defendant’s counsel, plaintiff did describe one and *333possibly two other routes she could have taken to get to her vehicle. (Deposition of plaintiff at 111-112.) However, just simply admitting that there was another route that could have been taken does not mean that it was safe and the one taken was not. Furthermore, plaintiff also testified in her deposition that she had traversed the same path as she took on the night in question several times previously without adverse incident. (Deposition of plaintiff at 51-52.) This fact might just as well indicate a basis for a belief by plaintiff that the path she chose was safe.
Given the circumstances described above, it would appear that none of the three requirements of the choice of ways doctrine have been satisfied. There is no real evidence concerning the real safety of any route; no evidence that any route was clearly unsafe; and no facts which would have given plaintiff clear warning of any danger on any given route she might have taken. Given the absence of anything resembling a satisfactory showing towards satisfying the choice of ways requirements,- coupled with the general “loathing” of Pennsylvania courts to apply this doctrine, the assumption of risk portion of defendant’s motion must also fail.9
V.
To summarize briefly, it is clear from the pleadings and discovery that one or more jury questions exist, and that these questions go to the very heart of this *334case. Defendant’s attempt to invoke the Local Government Immunity Act is misplaced because the exception for real property applies in this instance. Also, assumption of the risk, in the form of the choice of ways doctrine, is not applicable in this case. Plaintiff’s affidavits and expert’s report are not improper, and are properly considered for the purposes of .summary judgment. Therefore, defendant’s motion to quash affidavits must also be denied.
Given the high standard which must be met by the moving party prior to a motion for summary judgment being granted, it is clear that defendant’s motion in its entirety must be denied.10 An order will be entered accordingly.
ORDER
And now, July 20, 1994, this matter being currently before the court on defendant’s motion to quash affidavits, motion for summary judgment and motion to correct name of party, it is hereby ordered and decreed that defendant’s motion to quash affidavits and motion for summary judgment are denied based upon the analysis in the accompanying opinion.
It is further ordered that defendant’s motion to correct name of party is granted. Defendant shall now and hereafter be listed as “Sharon City School District” in any caption or reference to this case.

. Although both Sharon City Public Schools and the School District of the City of Sharon are listed as separate defendants in this action, counsel for the defense has informed the court that it would be more accurate to refer to a single defendant, that being the Sharon City School District. (Brief of defendant at 1.) Indeed, there is also a motion to correct name of party, filed contemporaneously with the motion for summary judgment, which is pending before the court.


. Although there are two plaintiffs named in this suit, use of the term “plaintiff’ shall be to Cathy I. Cousins unless otherwise specified.


. Any reference in this opinion to a complaint will be to the amended complaint which was filed in this action.


. The averments are set forth with greater specificity in the lettered subparagraphs of paragraph 18.


. Defendant contends that this is improper, and has sought to strike the affidavits insofar as the deposition of plaintiff constitutes a pleading which may not be contradicted or rescinded later on by affidavit. Plaintiff’s response, which shall be dealt with in greater detail later in this opinion, contends that her memory at the deposition may have been somewhat unsure due to her condition, her medication, or both, and that these uncertainties have been remedied prior to swearing out her affidavit.


. Defendant was given permission by the court at the oral argument of the motion for summary judgment to submit a supplemental brief in support of a motion to strike affidavits.


. There appears to be no dispute between the parties that defendant is a local agency for the purposes of the Act. Indeed, local agency immunity has been found to apply to school districts in personal injury litigation in the past. See Close v. Voorhees, 67 Pa. Commw. 205, 446 A.2d 728 (1982); Wimbish v. School District of Penn Hills, 59 Pa. Commw. 620, 430 A.2d 710 (1981).


. Lest there be any question concerning the propriety of utilizing the expert report provided by Dr. Oppenheim, this was filed as a supplemental answer to defendant’s interrogatory no. 3, which presumably inquired about experts plaintiffs might call at trial and their opinions. Consideration of this report in deciding a summary judgment motion, therefore, is entirely proper since “any party may move for summary judgment on the pleadings and any depositions, answers to interrogatories, admissions on file and supporting affidavits.” Pa.R.C.P. 1035(a). (emphasis added)


. This by no means is meant to suggest that plaintiff is free of any substantial burdens in this regard. While assumption of the risk may not be applicable in this instance, there may very well be a question of comparative negligence present. Comparative negligence, however, is an issue for the finder of fact at trial and not one properly considered at the summary judgment stage.


. Defendant’s motion to correct name of party, pursuant to Pa.R.C.P. 1033. which was filed with the motion for summary judgment, shall be granted in the order accompanying this opinion. Defendant shall, now and hereafter, be listed as “Sharon City School District” in any caption or reference to this case.

902262,902262,746957,Andre Mayfield v. Jim Morrow,"Andre MAYFIELD, Petitioner-Appellant, v. Jim MORROW, Respondent-Appellee","

  KETHLEDGE, Circuit Judge.
 

  A Tennessee jury convicted Andre May-field of raping two women. After the state denied his direct appeal and his post-conviction petition, Mayfield petitioned the federal district court for a writ of habeas corpus. The district court denied the petition. We affirm.
 

  I.
 

  In 1993, Mayfield pled guilty to three counts of aggravated rape and one count of aggravated robbery for the rapes of Clara Bumphus and Rosheka Alexander. A Tennessee trial court sentenced him to concurrent terms of twenty years for each count of aggravated rape and ten years for the aggravated-robbery count. The trial court, as part of Mayfield’s sentence, also provided that he would be eligible for parole after serving 30% of his time.
 

  Six years later, Tennessee’s Assistant Attorney General informed Mayfield and the trial court that Mayfield’s sentence might be illegal because Tennessee law does not allow the State to parole persons convicted of more than one rape.
  
   See
  
  Tenn.Code Ann. § 39-13-523. Because of that law, the Tennessee Department of Corrections had already designated May-field as parole-ineligible. Thereafter, Mayfield filed a motion to withdraw his plea, arguing that the Department of Corrections violated the terms of his plea agreement by requiring him to serve his entire sentence. The trial court granted the motion. The State then tried Mayfield on kidnapping, rape, and robbery charges.
 

  During the trial, Clara Bumphus testified that, on October 24, 1992, she was walking home through an alley when a man (whom she later identified as May-field) approached her from behind and placed a gun to her side. Upon feeling the gun, she told him: “Please don’t hurt me ... Please don’t kill me because I have children.” Mayfield forced her into an abandoned house and said: “Shut up. Don’t look at me. I’ll hurt you.... I’ll kill you.” He ordered her to lie on the floor. He then removed her underclothes and vaginally raped her with his penis. While raping Bumphus, Mayfield continued to point the gun at her face. When he finished raping her, Mayfield emptied Bum-phus’s purse onto the floor and took $51. He then escorted her to a nearby bus stop and let her go.
 

 
   *540
   
  Bumphus testified that Mayfield had not disguised his appearance when he attacked her and that she therefore “remembered his face clearly.”
  
   State v. Mayfield (Mayfield I),
  
  No. M1999-02415-CCA-R3-CD, 2001 WL 637700, at *2 (Tenn.Crim.App. June 11, 2001). She recalled giving the police a detailed description of her attacker’s appearance so that they could create a composite drawing of him. The State introduced the drawing as evidence at trial. She also stated that she identified May-field as her attacker during a police lineup.
 

  The second victim, 17-year-old Rosheka Alexander, testified that, on October 28, 1992, a man on a bike approached her while she was walking home from a friend’s house. Alexander later identified that man as Mayfield. After chatting with her briefly, Mayfield “pulled out a gun” and threatened to “blow her brains out” if she did not follow him.
  
   Id.
  
  at *3 (internal punctuation omitted). He took her down an alley to an empty house. Before they entered the house, Alexander tried to run away. She was unable to escape, however, because Mayfield “grabbed her from behind, put the gun against her back, and told her that if she tried to run again, he was going to blow her brains out.”
  
   Id.
  
  (internal punctuation omitted). Mayfield then dragged her into the house.
 

  According to Alexander, once they were in the house, Mayfield “threw her on the carpet, forced her to remove her skirt, and raped her vaginally with his penis.”
  
   Id.
  
  (internal punctuation omitted). After the rape, while she was crying, Mayfield asked whether he broke her virginity. When Alexander said yes, Mayfield appeared pleased and “got back on [her].”
  
   Id.
  
  Alexander tried to escape by telling Mayfield that she saw someone at the window. But when pressed by Mayfield, she admitted that she had not seen anyone. This angered Mayfield and he “started choking [her] ... [and] slapping [her] head on the floor.”
  
   Id.
  
  Mayfield eventually left, but before doing so he handed her a piece of paper “on which he had apparently written his name and phone number.”
  
   Id.
  


  Like Bumphus, Alexander testified that Mayfield did not attempt to disguise his appearance when he raped her, and that she was therefore able to look at his face. Alexander recalled that her attacker “had gold on his teeth.” She helped the police create a composite drawing of her attacker, which the State introduced as evidence. Prior to trial, Alexander identified May-field as her attacker during both a photograph line-up and a physical one. During the trial, Alexander also identified May-field as the man who had raped her.
 

  The jury found Mayfield guilty. The court sentenced him to fifteen years for each of the two aggravated kidnappings, fifteen years for the aggravated robbery, twenty years for the aggravated rape, and fifteen years for the rape. The court ordered some of the sentences to run concurrently and others consecutively, resulting in an effective sentence of 50 years.
 

  Mayfield appealed, and the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed.
  
   See id
  
  at *1. Proceeding pro se, Mayfield thereafter filed a number of legal actions contesting his conviction and sentence, including two petitions for state post-conviction relief. The Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals denied relief. Mayfield later filed a petition for federal habeas relief under 28 U.S.C. § 2254, which the district court denied. This appeal followed.
 

  II.
 

  We review de novo a district court’s denial of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus.
  
   Miller v. Colson,
  
  694 F.3d 691, 695 (6th Cir.2012). A prisoner is not enti-
   
   *541
   
  tied to habeas relief if he has procedurally defaulted a claim (absent good cause) or if the state court has adjudicated his claim on the merits and the state court’s decision was neither contrary to, nor an unreasonable application of, clearly established Supreme Court precedent. 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d).
 

  Mayfield first challenges the State’s refusal to consider him parole eligible after he served 30% of his sentence. Mayfield contends that the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause sets temporal limits on a State’s ability to change a prisoner’s sentence. The State responds that Mayfield procedurally defaulted this claim because he did not fairly present it to the state court and thus did not exhaust his state-court remedies.
  
   See Whiting v. Burt,
  
  395 F.3d 602, 612 (6th Cir.2005).
 

  “The extent to which th[is] claim[ ] is procedurally defaulted is a nettlesome question; the extent to which [it is] merit-less, much less so.”
  
   Storey v. Vasbinder,
  
  657 F.3d 372, 380 (6th Cir.2011) (internal quotation marks omitted). So we cut to the merits here.
 

  Mayfield argues that, although (according to him) he fairly presented his due-process claim to the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals, that court did not adjudicate the claim on the merits, which means that we should not defer to its decision under AEDPA. Mayfield notes that the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals only explicitly addressed whether the trial court had jurisdiction, under state law, to allow Mayfield to withdraw his guilty plea.
  
   See Mayfield v. State (Mayfield II),
  
  No. E2005-00138-CCA-R3-HC, 2005 WL 1798636, at *4 (Tenn.Crim.App. May 17, 2005). A state court is presumed to have adjudicated on the merits, however, all of a petitioner’s fairly presented federal claims even if the court only expressly addressed the petitioner’s state-law claims.
  
   Johnson v. Williams,
  
  - U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 1088, 1096, 185 L.Ed.2d 105 (2013). And Mayfield has not rebutted this presumption. We therefore apply AEDPA’s deferential standard of review.
  
   Id.
  


  As for the merits of this claim, there is no clearly established Supreme Court precedent which holds that a State violates due process by changing a prisoner’s release-eligibility date in accordance with state law. Moreover, Mayfield’s suggestion that the state trial court violated due process by modifying his sentence is belied by the record. Mayfield withdrew his guilty plea before the trial court had an opportunity to modify his original sentence. Rather than modify that sentence, therefore, the trial court imposed a new one after Mayfield went to trial. Thus, Mayfield cannot show that the Tennessee Court of Appeals’ rejection of his due-process claim was contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, “clearly established” Supreme Court precedent.
 

  Mayfield next claims that the State deprived him of his right to a fair trial by denying his motion to sever the Bumphus and Alexander rape counts. Here too, we cut to the merits.
 

  Mayfield argues that this claim should also be reviewed de novo. But he has again failed to rebut the presumption that the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals adjudicated this claim on the merits. Thus, we apply AEDPA’s deferential standard of review.
 

  Mayfield does not allege that the Tennessee Criminal Court of Appeals’ decision was contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, any Supreme Court case. The one Supreme Court ease he does cite—
  
   United States v. Lane,
  
  474 U.S. 438, 106 S.Ct. 725, 88 L.Ed.2d 814 (1986)—address-
   
   *542
   
  es the failure to sever criminal charges in dicta only.
  
   Id.
  
  at 446 n. 8, 106 S.Ct. 725. And “clearly established Federal law” for purposes of § 2254(d)(1) refers to “the holdings, as opposed to the dicta, of [the Supreme] Court’s decisions.”
  
   Williams v. Taylor,
  
  529 U.S. 362, 412, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000). Thus, as to May-field’s severance claim,
  
   Lane
  
  does not clearly establish anything.
  
   See Carey v. Musladin,
  
  549 U.S. 70, 74, 127 S.Ct. 649, 166 L.Ed.2d 482 (2006). We therefore reject this claim as well.
  
   See Miskel v. Karnes,
  
  397 F.3d 446, 455 (6th Cir.2005).
 

  Finally, Mayfield challenges the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals’ determination that the State did not violate
  
   Brady v. Maryland,
  
  373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), when it failed to disclose allegedly exculpatory evidence. A
  
   Brady
  
  violation occurs when a state “withholds evidence that is favorable to the defense and is material to the defendant’s guilt or punishment.”
  
   Smith v. Cain,
  
  - U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 627, 630, 181 L.Ed.2d 571 (2012). Evidence is material if “there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different.”
  
   United States v. Bagley,
  
  473 U.S. 667, 682, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 87 L.Ed.2d 481 (1985).
 

  The allegedly exculpatory evidence here is a police report regarding Alexander’s rape. The report contains a checklist of suspect characteristics, and includes checkmarks indicating that the rapist wore a “cloth-partial” mask and that he stuttered. The officer who completed the report also wrote under the “visible body scars” list that the rapist had a “scar on mouth[.]” R. 26-5 at 3.
 

  Mayfield contends that the report is material because it suggests that someone else raped Alexander. He notes that, unlike the attacker described in the report, he does not stutter or have a scar on his mouth. The report is also material, according to Mayfield, because it calls Alexander’s veracity into question — contrary to the report, she testified that her assailant was not wearing a mask. The Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals disagreed. It concluded that the report was not material because Mayfield had not shown that, had he “been privy to the police report prior to trial, the evidence may have resulted in a different judgment.”
  
   Mayfield v. State (Mayfield III),
  
  No. M2009-02640-CCA-R3-CO, 2010 WL 4545822, at *6 (Tenn. Crim.App. Nov. 12, 2010). In reaching that conclusion, the court detailed the “overwhelming” evidence of Mayfield’s guilt, including his fingerprints at the crime scene, the victim’s identification of him during both an in-person and photographic line-up, and the composite drawing of the attacker.
  
   Id.
  


  Mayfield argues that the Court of Criminal Appeals’ decision was contrary to
  
   United States v. Bagley, supra.
  
  According to Mayfield, when a court reviews a
  
   Brady
  
  claim,
  
   Bagley
  
  requires the court to consider whether there is a “reasonable probability” that, had the undisclosed evidence been available, the result of the trial would have been different. The Court of Criminal Appeals did not specifically reference
  
   Bagley’s
  
  “reasonable probability” language. Therefore, Mayfield reasons, the Court of Appeals’ decision was contrary to
  
   Bagley
  
  and
  
   Brady.
  


  But a state court decision is not “contrary to” federal law simply because it fails to reference a particular standard.
  
   Early v. Packer,
  
  537 U.S. 3, 8, 123 S.Ct. 362, 154 L.Ed.2d 263 (2002). Instead, relief under the “contrary to” prong is only warranted when a state court’s decision either “applies a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth” in a Supreme Court case or “confronts a set of facts that are materially
   
   *543
   
  indistinguishable from a decision of [the Supreme Court’s] and nevertheless arrives” at a different result.
  
   Id.
  
  Neither of those situations occurred here.
 

  The state court’s rejection of Mayfield’s claim is consistent with the Supreme Court’s decisions in both
  
   Bagley
  
  and
  
   Brady.
  
  Even if the police had turned over the report to Mayfield, there is not a reasonable probability that the result of May-field’s trial would have been different. Bumphus and Alexander each identified Mayfield on multiple occasions as their attacker. Bumphus testified that she was raped at midday and that she saw May-field’s face clearly. Mayfield’s fingerprints were found at the scene of Alexander’s rape. And each victim helped the police create a composite image of their attacker that the State introduced at trial. Thus, even if the report would have called into question Alexander’s ability to recall her attacker, the jury had a chance to test her recall by considering the composite drawing she helped the police create. Given the State’s evidence against Mayfield, the state court’s determination that the report’s disclosure would not have changed the outcome of the trial was not “beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.”
  
   Harrington v. Richter,
  
  - U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 770, 786-87, 178 L.Ed.2d 624 (2011).
 

  Moreover, contrary to Mayfield’s argument before us, this case is distinguishable from
  
   Kyles v. Whitley,
  
  514 U.S. 419, 115 S.Ct. 1555, 131 L.Ed.2d 490 (1995). The evidence withheld there was much more exculpatory than the evidence withheld here. In
  
   Kyles,
  
  the petitioner was convicted of murder based primarily on the accounts of four eyewitnesses. But the State withheld multiple pieces of evidence that strongly suggested that another man — the man who implicated Kyles — had actually committed the murder. In addition, the defense’s theory all along was that the other man — Beanie—had committed the murder. Kyles could have used the withheld evidence to show that the lead detective was “either less than wholly candid or less than fully informed[.]” 514 U.S. at 453, 115 S.Ct. 1555. The State also withheld evidence that one of its two best eyewitnesses initially gave a description that matched Beanie, and that another eyewitness had been coached by the prosecution. And the withheld evidence showed that the initial descriptions given by the four eyewitnesses were inconsistent with each other.
 

  Here, in contrast, the withheld evidence did not suggest that another potential suspect committed the rapes. Nor was that evidence the only way for the jury to test Alexander’s recollection. As explained above, the State’s case against Mayfield was strong. The state court thus reasonably concluded that the withheld report would have done little to undercut it.
 

  Mayfield also argues that the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals’ decision was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts. In particular, he challenges the state court’s finding that “the assailant gave Ms. Alexander a piece of paper on which he had written his name and phone number.”
  
   Mayfield III,
  
  2010 WL 4545822, at *6. The evidence presented to the state court included Alexander’s testimony that her attacker handed her a piece of paper with his name and number on it.
  
   See
  
  R. 72-3 at PagelD # 1206 (“he handed me a piece of paper with his number on it, and I didn’t want it”);
  
   id.
  
  at PagelD # 1233-34 (“A: You stated that he gave you a note? A: Correct. Q: And it had his name or his nickname on it, correct? A: Correct.”). Based on this evidence, it was reasonable for the state court to conclude that Alexander’s attacker had given her a piece of paper with his name and
   
   *544
   
  phone number. Thus, this argument is meritless.
 

  The district court’s judgment is affirmed.

  OPINION
 

  ONION, Judge.
 

  The offense is robbery by assault; the punishment, life.
 

  Appellant contends the State failed to prove the corpus delicti and the evidence is insufficient to sustain the conviction.
 

 
   *485
   
  Omitting the formal parts, the indictment charged that appellant on or about November 1, 1967,
 

  “did then and there unlawfully in the County and State aforesaid, in and upon Mrs. J. H. Wilson make an assault; and did then and there, by the said assault, and by violence to the said Mrs. J. H. Wilson, and by putting the said Mrs. J. H. Wilson in fear of life and bodily injury, and then and there fraudulently, and without the consent of the said Mrs. J. H. Wilson, take from the possession of her, the said Mrs. J. H. Wilson, good and lawful United States currency, the same being then and there the corporeal personal property of the said Mrs. J. H. Wilson, with the intent then and there to deprive the said Mrs. J. H. Wilson, of the value of the same, and to appropriate the same to his, EMILIO GUTIERREZ CASIAS’ own use * * *
  
   »
  


  The trial of the case was complicated by the inability of the complaining witness to testify as a result of injuries received. The State relies upon appellant’s confession and the law of circumstantial evidence.
 

  The record reflects that on the morning of November 1, 1967, Lubbock police officers found “Mrs. Wilson” lying in a blood-splattered room in a house at 1309 7th Street in the city of Lubbock. She was “one bloody mess” and a blood stained hammer was discovered nearby. The house had been ransacked and apparently thoroughly searched.
 

  Mrs. J. H. (Hettie) Wilson was shown to have been admitted in critical condition to the Methodist Hospital in Lubbock on November 1, 1967. She had multiple compound depressed skull fractures, a broken arm and was near death. Surgery followed.
 

  Helen Lieb testified that Mrs. J. H. Wilson had lived at 1309 7th Street in Lubbock on November 1, 1967, and that she had seen her in the Lubbock Methodist Hospital shortly after that date; that Mrs. Wilson was at the time of the trial 76 years old and in a nursing home in Albany, Texas, being cared for by Mrs. Lieb’s mother and aunt; that Mrs. Wilson was like a child and had never mentioned the incident of November 1, 1967; that she was physically unable to be present at the trial.
 

  Omitting the warnings and formal parts, appellant’s extrajudicial confession reads as follows:
 

  “I wish to say that last night that I
  
   sleep
  
  in a car next to Brooks Super market. Today I got up and started walking looking for somewhere to break into because I needed a shot, I walked by a house and the front door was open and I went into the house and there was
  
   a
  
  old woman sitting in the living room and I asked her for her money. She said that she wasn’t going to give it to me and I saw a hammer
  
   laying in
  
  the floor and I picked it up and hit her with it. I think I hit her three times. I don’t know what made me hit her but I did hit her. I then searched the house and the only money I found was some in a cloth sack and it was all in change. After I searched the house I left and went to a grocery store and had the man there at the store to call a Cab. The Cab came and picked me up and took me to 30th and Ave A where he let me out and I walked over to the house where the police picked me up. I changed my shirt and shoes at the house and then the man that lives at the house wanted to go to the grocery store and get some groceries and I went with him. When we returned back to the house that is when the Police picked me up. I wish to say that I am
  
   a
  
  addict and that I was needing a shot and that is the reason that I broke into the house was to get me some money to buy me some
  
   Heroin.
  
  I can read the English language and this statement is true and correct.”
 

  Other evidence showed that the appellant appeared at a Lubbock grocery store approximately a block and a half from 1309
   
   *486
   
  7th Street on the morning of November 1, 1967, with stains on his hands, handed an employee there a dime and requested he call a taxi cab. The taxi driver testified he picked up the appellant at the grocery store and took him to the address at which he was subsequently arrested and related he had been paid by the appellant $1.15 entirely in change. The appellant was later arrested on November 1, 1967, at 30th and Ave A Streets in Lubbock, with a pocketful of change, either $3.00 or $5.00.
 

  The blood on the hammer was shown to be type O human blood which was the same blood type possessed by Mrs. Wilson and the appellant.
 

  “In establishing the corpus delicti, the confession may be used in connection with the other facts and circumstances, that is, the confession may be used to aid the proof of the corpus delicti, and the corpus delicti may be proved by circumstances as well as by direct evidence. Watson v. State, 154 [Tex.]Crim.[R.] 438, 227 S.W.2d 559.” 5 Branch’s Ann. P.C., 2nd ed., Sec. 2596, pp. 28-29; 24 Tex.Jur.2d, Evidence, Secs. 675 and 730.
 

  The court charged the jury on the law of circumstantial evidence and we conclude that evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the State as we are required to do, is sufficient to sustain the jury’s verdict. We specifically reject appellant’s claims that (a) the evidence failed to show that the Mrs. Wilson found at 1309 7th Street was the Mrs. J. H. Wilson alleged in the indictment, (b) the evidence was insufficient to show lack of consent by Mrs. J. H. Wilson to the taking of her property and (c) the evidence was insufficient to show that currency taken, if any, belonged to Mrs. J. H. Wilson.
 

  The question of whether the evidence supports the allegation that appellant took “good and lawful United States currency” is without merit in light of the evidence that appellant confessed he took change, that he paid the cab driver with coined money, and was later found in possession of change or coined money.
 

  “Currency” is defined in Black’s Law-Dictionary, 3rd ed., as “coined money and such bank notes or other paper money as are authorized by law and do in fact circulate from hand to hand as the medium of exchange.”
 

  “Current money” is defined in the same authority as “[t]he currency of the country; whatever is intended to and does actually circulate as currency; every species of coin or currency.”
 

  “The terms ‘money’ and ‘current money of the United States’ include gold, silver and other minor coins, bank bills, legal tender notes, gold and silver certificates, and every kind of paper currency which passes current as money under the guarantee of the United States.” 5 Branch’s Ann.P.C., 2nd ed., Sec. 2824, p. 335.
 

  While the Texas cases have not always been consistent, the better view seems to be , that adopted in Brittain v. State, 52 Tex. Cr.R. 169, 105 S.W. 817, where the court said:
 

  “Currency, or lawful currency, is broad enough, under the decisions as we find them, to include gold and silver, as well as what we usually term ‘paper currency.’ ”
 

  In Brittain, a theft from person prosecution, the indictment alleged “two dollars in money, lawful currency of the United States of America * * * ” and the evidence showed two silver dollars were taken.
 

  Grounds of error #2 and #3 are overruled.
 

  In his fourth ground of error appellant contends the trial court erred in admitting appellant’s extrajudicial confession which contained admission of “other or extraneous offenses.” Appellant relies upon that portion of the written confession which reads:
 

  “Today I got up and started walking looking for somewhere to break in be
   
   *487
   
  cause I needed a shot. * * * I wish to say that I am
  
   a
  
  addict and that I was needing a shot and that is the reason that I broke into the house was to get me some money to buy me some
  
   herion.”
  


  The fact that a person has the status of being a narcotic addict has not been considered a crime since the decision of Robinson v. California, 370 U.S. 660, 82 S.Ct. 1417, 8 L.Ed.2d 758. See also Salas v. State, Tex.Cr.App., 365 S.W.2d 174, cert. dism. 375 U.S. 15, 84 S.Ct. 96, 11 L.Ed.2d 45; Ex parte Rogers, Tex.Cr.App., 366 S.W.2d 559; Article 7256, Vernon’s Ann. P.C.
 

  Further, an intent to commit a crime (i. e., the possession of heroin) in absence of an overt act does not normally constitute the commission of an offense.
 

  In Sustaita v. State, Tex.Cr.App., 396 S.W.2d 381, it was held that admission into evidence of portions of the defendant’s confession relating to reasons and means whereby he was armed and at the theater on the night of the shooting was not for the purpose of proving extraneous offenses and was not reversible error in a murder prosecution. Assuming the objection was sufficient, we overrule ground of error #4.
 

  And for the same reasons set forth above, the trial court did not err in failing to instruct the jury as to extraneous offenses contained in the confession.
 

  Ground of error #5 is overruled.
 

  Further, we cannot agree that the court erred in refusing to instruct the jury relative to the allegedly exculpatory statement contained in the confession introduced by the State. Appellant relies upon the statement “I don’t know what made me hit her, but I did hit her.” Such statement when read in the context in which it is found in the confession is not such as to have required the court to have charged as desired by the appellant. In 23 Tex. Jur.2d, Evidence, Sec. 116, p. 116, it is written: “The State need not disprove such statements if they are actually not sufficient to exculpate the defendant or if other circumstances exist to connect him with the offense charged.” We think the charge given adequately protected appellant’s rights.
 

  Ground of error #6 is overruled.
 

  Appellant also complains that the court erred in failing to instruct the jury to disregard his confession if they found from the evidence or had a reasonable doubt that he did not have the mental ability to understand the contents thereof and the warnings allegedly given.
 

  Appellant’s first trial under this indictment concluded on April 18, 1968, with his punishment being assessed by the jury at confinement for 40 years. On June 20, 1968, appellant’s motion for new trial was granted as a result of the trial court’s refusal to grant appellant’s timely demand for a preliminary hearing to determine appellant’s present insanity or competency to stand trial. Such action was taken in light of the decision of this court in Townsend v. State, 427 S.W.2d 55, rendered on April 24, 1968. See also Morales v. State, Tex.Cr.App., 427 S.W.2d 51.
 

  After the motion for new trial was granted, appellant’s court appointed attorneys were allowed to withdraw and two other attorneys were appointed for the second trial.
 

  Prior to the second trial which resulted in the conviction from which this appeal is taken, a motion to withdraw the request or demand for a separate sanity hearing to determine his competency to stand trial was made. To support such motion the appellant called Dr. Murray R. Kovnar, a clinical psychologist and a professor at Texas Tech University. Dr. Kovnar related that as a result of tests given since the first trial he had concluded that the 28 year old appellant knew the difference between right and wrong and understood the nature of the proceedings against him. Appellant’s
   
   *488
   
  attorneys assured the court no evidence as to competency to stand trial or insanity as a defense would be offered at the trial on merits. The court, then, with the personal consent of the appellant, allowed the motion to be withdrawn.
 

  At the hearing in the jury’s absence to determine the admissibility and voluntariness of the confession, Dr. Kovnar again testified and stated appellant had an I.Q. of 68, was retarded, was not able in his opinion to read, was illiterate, had a limited vocabulary, had a mental age of eight to ten years of age, and an educational equivalent of “approximately second grade.” The court found the confession to have been voluntarily made after all proper warnings had been given and waiver obtained. He further found the appellant had stated to the officers he could read and had appeared to read the confession. The record also shows that the appellant swore to the confession and stated to the notary public that the same was true and correct.
 

  When the issue of voluntariness was raised before the jury Dr. Kovnar again testified as he had in the jury’s absence. He acknowledged that appellant could have understood the warnings given and while he disagreed with the sentence structure and arrangement of the body of the confession, he did agree that appellant could have conveyed the message contained therein. He expressed the thought that appellant would have said “sack” rather than “cloth sack.”
 

  Dr. Kovnar again reiterated that in his opinion the appellant knew right from wrong and understood the nature of the proceedings against him.
 

  The court fully submitted the issue of voluntariness to the jurors requiring that before considering the confession they must find all the proper warnings were given and that appellant did “knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily waive those rights prior to and during the making of the alleged statement.”
 

  The court did not respond to appellant’s objection that the court had failed to charge on his mental ability to understand the contents of the statement.
 

  It has been said that there is a general agreement among courts that a confession of crime is not inadmissible merely because the accused, who was not insane, was of less than normal intelligence, Vasquez v. State, 163 Tex.Cr.R. 16, 288 S.W.2d 100, and mere illiteracy has not been considered as a form of mental subnormality. Berry v. State, 58 Tex.Cr.R. 291, 125 S.W. 580. In Vasquez, the confession was held to be admissible where the accused was shown to have been a “mentally deficient person between a moron and an imbecile” who had a “mental age of 4 years and 7 months.”
 

  Of course, if the mental subnormality is so great that an accused is incapable of understanding the meaning and effect of his confession, then it would not be admissible. Grayson v. State, 40 Tex.Cr.R. 573, 51 S.W. 246.
 

  In Hanus v. State, 104 Tex.Cr.R. 543, 286 S.W. 218, it was pointed out that there is considerable authority for the proposition that in determining the admissibility of a confession of a crime, the fact that it was made by one whose mentality was at a lower than normal level is to be taken into consideration and viewed as a factor indicating, although not establishing, that the confession was lacking in voluntariness.
 

  Here, as in Vasquez, there was no contention that the accused was insane, and although the testimony as to his low mentality would not be without weight on the question of admissibility, the evidence in the case did not show the accused was an incompetent witness
  
   1
  
  or that his confession should have been excluded.
 

 
   *489
   
  As in Grayson v. State, Tex.Cr.App., 438 S.W.2d 553, it is difficult to see how one accused of a crime may not have sufficient intelligence or mental ability to understand the content of his confession and yet be competent to stand trial, understand the nature of the charge against him and to assist his counsel in preparing a rational defense.
 

  While the trial court might have been well advised to have responded to appellant’s objection to the charge, we cannot conclude, in light of the evidence offered, the charge on voluntariness and counsel’s jury argument on intelligence and mental ability as a factor to be considered in determining voluntariness, that the court’s failure to charge as desired was calculated to injure appellant’s rights or deprived him of a fair and impartial trial. See Article 38.19, V.A.C.C.P.
 

  Ground of error #1 is overruled.
 

  The appellant next contends the court erred in allowing one State’s witness to bolster another witness’ testimony. He relies upon Lyons v. State, Tex.Cr.App., 388 S.W.2d 950 and Vines v. State, Tex.Cr. App., 397 S.W.2d 868. See also Ward v. State, Tex.Cr.App., 427 S.W.2d 876; Brown v. State, Tex.Cr.App., 403 S.W.2d 411. Cf. King v. State, Tex.Cr.App., 402 S.W.2d 746; Beasley v. State, Tex.Cr.App., 428 S.W.2d 317.
 

  In Lyons v. State, supra, this court wrote:
 

  “It is the rule that while a witness who has identified her assailant at the trial may testify that she also identified him while he was in custody of the police, others may not bolster her unimpeached testimony by corroborating the fact that she did identify him.”
 

  In the case at bar the taxi cab driver Weldon identified the appellant as the man he picked up on November 1, 1967, one and one-half blocks from the place where the offense had been committed and that he had subsequently “picked him (the appellant) out of the lineup.” The witness Hayes identified the appellant as the man who entered the grocery store where he (Hayes) was employed and asked him to call a taxi cab. Hayes did not testify as to' any lineup.
 

  Officer Rivie Garrett testified that after appellant’s arrest the taxicab driver and the boy from Sandlin grocery were summoned. The record then reflects the following:
 

  “Q. All right, and then what ?
 

  “A. Had them to come down to the station and we placed him in a line up along with the other two men that was in the car.
 

  “Q. All right. And then what did
  
   you
  
  do after that?
 

  “A. Well, he was picked out of the line up and * * (emphasis supplied)
 

  While appellant’s prompt objection was not sustained, no further inquiry as to the lineup or identification was made. It is observed that the portion of the witness’ answer given was unresponsive and did not reveal who made an identification. Under these circumstances we would not be inclined to apply the rule discussed in Lyons.
 

  Ground of error #7 is overruled.
 

  Relying upon North Carolina v. Pearce—Simpson v. Rice, 395 U.S. 711, 89 S.Ct. 2072, 23 L.Ed.2d 656, 659, the appellant contends the court erred in allowing the jury to assess a greater punishment than 40 years. This contention is based on the fact that appellant’s life conviction stems from his second trial. At his first trial the penalty assessed by the jury was 40 years. At the appellant’s behest a motion for new trial, as earlier noted, was granted. North Carolina v. Pearce—Simp-son v. Rice, supra, holds that increased punishment on retrial is constitutionally prohibited unless the reasons therefor are made a part of the record. The decisions
   
   *490
   
  sought to prevent increased penalties from being the product of the sentencing judge’s retaliatory motives or vindictiveness resulting from the accused’s successful effort in securing a new trial. Unfortunately, the United States Supreme Court did not discuss Pearce’s application to Texas and other jurisdictions where the jury is permitted, in many instances, to assess punishment.
 

  In Branch v. State, Tex.Cr.App., 445 S.W.2d 756, this court held that Pearce did not have application where the appellant chose the jury to assess the punishment and, further, where the proof offered at the subsequent trial sustained the allegation of the two prior convictions alleged for enhancement which under Article 63, V.A. P.C., required as a matter of law an increased punishment over the penalty assessed at the original trial where the State failed in its proof of one of the prior convictions alleged for enhancement.
 

  In Gibson v. State, Tex.Cr.App., 448 S.W.2d 481, the majority of this court, citing Branch v. State, supra, held that the mere fact that the defendant’s increased punishment was assessÃÂ©d by the jury in accordance with his request that the penalty be so assessed rendered Pearce inapplicable. Such position finds support in the decisions of Spidle v. State (Mo.) 446 S.W.2d 793 and Pinkard v. Henderson (Tenn.Ct.Crim. App.) 6 Cr.L. 2148.
  
   2
  


  For the reasons stated, ground of error #8 is overruled.
 

  Finding no reversible error, the judgment is affirmed.
 


   1
  

   . At tlie first trial the appellant testified as a witness as to the voluntariness of the confession. At the penalty stage of the proceedings at the second trial it was revealed appellant had previously been convicted on the same day of three felonies.
  


   2
  

   . This writer joined in the opinion on rehearing in Branch v. State, supra, since there was considerably more there presented than the simple fact that the defendant had chosen the jury to assess punishment at his retrial. In Gibson v. State, supra, this writer concurred since there was no evidence that the jury at the second trial was aware that the appellant had been previously tried and convicted for the same offense and had secured a new trial at his behest. Neither did Gibson insist the retrial jury had such knowledge and was motivated thereby in assessing an increased penalty, or that there were no new facts to justify the increased punishment. In addition to appellant’s request for a jury at his second trial, the same factors as in Gibson are presented here. Still further, the record of the first trial has been brought forward in the record before us and it is evident additional facts were presented, it cannot be concluded that Pearce calls for reversal in this case.
  

   This writer, however, not speaking for the majority, does not depart from the position he took in Gibson that he could not join at this time in a flat statement that the principle of Pearce could never have application where the punishment upon retrial is assessed by the jury rather than by a judge. An accused’s choice of a jury to assess punishment at his retrial should not be so burdened.

*161OLSZEWSKI, Judge,
concurring and dissenting.
I agree with the majority that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in the determination of Husband’s monthly income to be $3,272. Further, I agree with the majority that 23 Pa.C.S.A. § 4352(e) is not applicable to the second issue, whether the order of support should have been modified as of the date of emancipation with Husband receiving credit for excess payments made from such date, because such statute relates only to arrearage situations. However, I respectfully disagree with my learned colleagues as to their disposition of the second issue.
While I am most reluctant to disagree with the majority, I find that to agree would overrule our holding in Miller v. Miller, 353 Pa.Super. 194, 509 A.2d 402 (1986). In Miller, we held that a husband could receive credit for support payments made directly to his child after the date of such child’s emancipation. Id. at 198, 509 A.2d at 404. In the instant case, however, the majority finds that Husband can receive credit for excess post-emancipation support payments made only after the date of the petition to modify the support order, not the date of emancipation. See infra. 23 Pa.C.S.A. § 4323(a) states that the “court shall not order either or both parents to pay for the support of a child if the child is emancipated.” Id. Hence, the statute recognizes that a parent cannot be ordered to pay support for a child after the date of emancipation and Miller recognizes that a parent can *162receive credit for such payments made following the date of emancipation. To allow Husband credit for excess support payments made only back to the date of the petition would overrule Miller, which we have no power to do. Therefore, I find that the trial court abused its discretion in ordering credit to be given to Husband for excess support payments made only after the date of the petition, as credit should have properly accrued to Husband for such payments made beginning on the date of the child’s emancipation.

BENTON, J.
Trisha’s One Stop, Inc. appeals a final order of the Office of Financial Regulation that imposed a fine of $15,000 and revoked its license to operate a “money services business” pursuant to Chapter 560, Part III, Florida Statutes (2010). We affirm the final order.
Proceedings below began when the Office of Financial Regulation filed an administrative complaint that alleged multiple violations of Chapter 5601 and proposed to *287enter a final order “imposing an administrative fÃÂ­ne of $15,000, the entry of a Cease and Desist Order, and taking any other appropriate action against Respondent’s license issued pursuant to Chapter 560.” See §§ 560.114, 560.1285, 560.810, Fla. Stat. (2010); Fla. Admin. Code R. 69V-560.704. The administrative complaint gave clear notice of a point of entry, stating that failure to respond within twenty-one days of receipt would be deemed a waiver of all rights to a hearing “and Final Order will be entered without further notice.”
Trisha’s One Stop failed to file a petition for hearing in response to the administrative complaint, which it received by certified mail on December 5, 2012. Accordingly, on January 25, 2013, the final order under review was entered without a hearing. As the basis for administrative action, the final order incorporated the facts alleged in the complaint by reference, and adopted them as the facts supporting the agency’s action. The Office of Financial Regulation ordered Trisha’s One Stop to pay a $15,000 fine and revoked its license.
The cases are clear that “[w]hen a party waives the right to challenge the factual allegations of an administrative complaint, ... the facts of the complaint are deemed to be admitted.” Nicks v. Dep’t of Bus. & Prof’l Regulation, 957 So.2d 65, 67 n. 1 (Fla. 5th DCA 2007). Because Trisha’s One Stop failed to file a petition for a hearing in response to the administrative complaint within the time allowed, the facts alleged in the complaint were deemed the facts of the case. See Fla. Admin. Code R. 28-106.111(2) & (4); Wojnowski v. State, Office of Fin. Regulation, 98 So.3d 189, 191 (Fla. 1st DCA 2012) (holding that when Wojnowski “failed to timely seek an administrative hearing to challenge the facts supporting OFR’s intended action, he waived any further opportunity to do so,” citing Florida Administrative Code Rule 28-106.111(4)); Diaz v. State, Dep’t of Bus. & Prof’l Regulation, 21 So.3d 919, 920 (Fla. 3d DCA 2009) (holding that any person who receives written notice of an agency decision that does or may determine substantial interests and who fails to file a written request for a hearing within 21 days waives the right to request a hearing, quoting Florida Administrative Code Rule 28-106.111(4)); Aleong v. Fla. Dep’t of Bus. & Prof’l Regulation, 963 So.2d 799, 801-02 (Fla. 4th DCA 2007) (upholding the Board of Veterinary Medicine’s order granting the Department’s Motion for Waiver of Rights filed after Dr. Aleong failed to make a timely request for a hearing to dispute the Department’s allegations, relying on Florida Administrative Code Rule 28-106.111); Autoworld of Am. Corp. v. Dep’t of Highway Safety, 754 So.2d 76, 77 (Fla. 3d DCA 2000) (“In order to challenge the factual basis of the complaint, it would have been necessary for Autoworld to request a formal hearing under subsection 120.57(1).”). Trisha’s One Stop’s failure to request a hearing was a “green light” for the agency to decide the case on the basis of the facts alleged in the complaint, and to impose any appropriate penalty.
Trisha’s One Stop’s reliance on Scott v. Department of Professional Regulation, *288603 So.2d 519 (Fla. 1st DCA 1992), is misplaced.2 There we did say that Ms. Scott’s failure to appear or respond did not relieve the Department of its obligation to substantiate the charges against her,3 citing Florida State Board of Medical Examiners v. James, 175 So.2d 815 (Fla. 3d DCA 1965). But, as we noted in Giordano v. Department of Banking & Finance, 596 So.2d 712, 714 (Fla. 1st DCA 1992), James “was decided prior to the implementation of the Administrative Procedures Act” and “involved the entry of an administrative default order based on respondent’s failure to appear, without notice to the respondent that a result of such a failure could be default.”4 The Scott court itself clarified on rehearing that the decision did not require the Department to convene a section 120.57(1) hearing “in such circumstances” — i.e., when a licensee does not “respond to the» complaint against her.” Scott, 603 So.2d at 520.
In the present case, the administrative complaint alleged four distinct violations, advised Trisha’s One Stop that section 560.114(7), Florida Statutes, authorized imposition of a fine of up to $10,000 per violation and suspension or revocation of a license, and that “the Office will enter a FINAL ORDER imposing any statutory penalties authorized by Chapter 560, Florida Statutes, which may include revocation or suspension of Respondent’s license as a money services business in this state and imposition of an administrative fine.” This is not a case where the agency relied on facts not pleaded in the complaint. The administrative complaint also notified Trisha’s One Stop that failure to respond within twenty-one days of receipt of the administrative complaint “shall be deemed a waiver of all rights to a hearing, and Final Order will be entered without further notice.” Despite this, Trisha’s One Stop failed to file a timely petition for a hearing, and so forfeited its right to an evidentiary hearing.5
Affirmed.
PADOVANO and RAY, JJ., concur.

. The administrative complaint alleged that an examination of the business records for Trisha’s One Stop, for the period of August 8, 2010 through August 7, 2011, revealed Trisha's One Stop’s failure to: (1) maintain a copy of the photographic identification pre*287sented by the customer for payment instruments accepted having a face value of $1,000.00 or more; (2) maintain thumbprints of customers who cashed checks in amounts over $1,000.00; (3) have an independent review of its anti-money laundering program; and (4) maintain corporate files on all customers who cashed corporate or third-party payment instruments exceeding $1,000.00. The facts alleged in the administrative complaint are sufficient to establish the alleged violations of Chapter 560 and to justify the penalties imposed.


. Ms. Scott, a registered nurse, challenged an administrative order that suspended her license ""after a hearing before the Board of Nursing.” Scott v. Department of Professional Regulation, 603 So.2d 519, 520 (Fla. 1st DCA 1992). She did not appear at the hearing and did not respond otherwise to the complaint against her.


. Because the only evidence presented at the hearing was a hearsay report which would not have been admissible over objection in a civil action, the Scott panel determined there was insufficient evidence to support the findings and reversed the order suspending the license. Id.


. In contrast, the administrative complaint informed Giordano, just as it informed appellant in the present case, that the failure to timely request a hearing constituted a waiver of the right to do so and that a final order would be entered, so that there was ""no error in the failure to hold an evidentiary proceeding on the allegations of the complaint prior to entry of the final order.” Giordano v. Dep’t of Banking & Fin., 596 So.2d 712, 714 (Fla. 1st DCA 1992).


.We reject appellant’s argument that the doctrine of equitable tolling applies here. Trisha’s One Stop does not assert it was prevented from filing a petition or misled by the agency into inaction during the twenty-one day period. See, e.g., Riverwood Nursing Ctr., LLC v. Agency for Health Care Admin., 58 So.3d 907, 910 (Fla. 1st DCA 2011) (rejecting claim that the deadline for filing the request for hearing should have been equitably tolled because of representations by AHCA’s counsel made ""after' the filing deadline had already expired,” not ""before the deadline expired ”).

ORDER ON MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
LOUGHLIN, District Judge.
In this action, plaintiffs bring suit for monetary and injunctive relief against defendants Mai Kai of Concord and Peter S. Yee for violation of rights secured under the federal copyright law, 17 U.S.C. §§ 501, et seq. Jurisdiction is based upon 28 U.S.C. § 1331(a) and the matter is presently before the court on plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment pursuant to Fed.R. Civ.P. 56.
It is well established that summary judgment is appropriate only when the pleadings and other submissions show that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Rule 56(c), Fed. R.Civ.P.; Finn v. Consolidated Rail Corp., 782 F.2d 13, 15 (1st Cir.1986); CIA Petrolera Caribe, Inc. v. Arco Caribbean, Inc., 754 F.2d 404, 411 (1st Cir.1985). ""In this circuit, the test to which a summary judgment motion must be put has traditionally been a stringent one. The moving party must affirmatively demonstrate that there is no genuine, relevant factual issue, and the court must look at the record in the light most favorable to the opposing party and indulge all inferences favorable to that party."" Worsowicz v. Nashua Corp., 612 F. Supp. 310, 311 (D.N.H.1985) (citations omitted). The pleadings and submissions in the present case reveal the following facts.
At all times pertinent to this action, plaintiffs were proprietors of the copyright for the following musical compositions:

Plaintiffs are also members of the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (""ASCAP"") to which they have granted the non-exclusive right to license non-dramatic public performances for profit of their musical compositions. ASCAP has a membership of greater than 23,000 and licenses over 30,000 establishments nationwide to perform any of the compositions in its repertory.
Defendant Peter Yee owns four restaurants in New Hampshire, each known as the Mai Kai Restaurant, located in Manchester, Hampton, Dover and Concord; each restaurant is separately incorporated. The Concord entity, Mai Kai of Concord, Inc., is a named defendant in this action. Mr. Yee is the present treasurer, director and sole shareholder for each of the Mai Kai Restaurants.
The defendant Mai Kai of Concord, Inc. (hereinafter Mai Kai) was opened for business in July, 1982. In March, 1983, B. Robert Gendreau, the New England District Manager for ASCAP, wrote to Mr. Yee seeking a license agreement for the Mai Kai. The correspondence went unheeded by defendants; ASCAP over the next two years, through March, 1985, attempted without success to reach a licensing agreement with defendants. The record reveals that from March, 1983 to March, 1985, ASCAP sent eleven letters to defendants, sent personal representatives *632 to speak with Mr. Yee, and counsel for ASCAP sent one letter to defendants seeking said license. Mr. Yee, not disputing that ASCAP contacted him, attributes his failure to acquire an ASCAP license to a shortage of funds and his belief that the license fee was unreasonably high. ASCAP sought a fee of $1133. Mr. Yee had licensed his three other restaurants in the past.
The Mai Kai presents live musical entertainment five nights a week, Tuesday through Saturday, with a cover charge imposed Thursday through Saturday night. In addition, a juke box on the premises provides musical entertainment for patrons. Mr. Yee oversees operation of the Mai Kai with the assistance of a manager. While vesting some responsibility for operation in the manager, Mr. Yee still sets hours and menu prices. Moreover, in conjunction with the manager, Mr. Yee made the business decision to have live entertainment in the restaurant. The manager makes the specific arrangements with the bands.
The tax return for the Mai Kai for the fiscal year ending April 30, 1984 revealed gross receipts totalling $890,783.00. Mr. Yee takes a salary from each of his four restaurants. From the defendant Mai Kai he receives $1500 per month. Defendant's 1983 tax return also reveals a deduction for music and entertainment totalling $80,365, such deduction attributable to payment for bands.
Faced with defendants' obstinacy, ASCAP sent two representatives to the Mai Kai on the night of January 11, 1985. The representatives paid a cover charge for admission and during the course of the evening were present for the performance of plaintiffs' copyrighted compositions. Mr. Yee acknowledges that the compositions were performed without permission of plaintiffs. The instant suit was filed in April, 1985 and Mr. Yee finally entered into a licensing agreement as to all four restaurants in October, 1985 for a fee of $1027.00.
The Copyright Act codified in Title 17 of the United States Code provides the owner of a copyright with the exclusive right, subject to express limitations, to perform or to authorize performance of copyrighted works. See 17 U.S.C. §§ 105 et seq. Moreover, any person who violates the exclusive rights of the copyright owner is an infringer of the copyright, 17 U.S.C. § 501(a), such that the copyright owner may seek injunctive relief, 17 U.S.C. § 502(a), statutory damages, 17 U.S.C. § 504(c)(1) and attorneys fees and costs, 17 U.S.C. § 505.
In order for a copyright owner to prevail in an infringement action, five elements must be established:
1. The originality and authorship of the compositions involved;
2. Compliance with the formalities of the Copyright Act;
3. That plaintiffs are the proprietors of the copyrights of the compositions involved;
4. That the compositions were performed publicly for profit; and
5. That the defendants had not received proper authorization for performance of the compositions.
Blendingwell Music, Inc. v. Moor-Law, Inc., 612 F. Supp. 474, 479-80 (D.Del.1985) (citations omitted); Fourth Floor Music, Inc. v. Der Place, Inc., 572 F. Supp. 41, 43 (D.Neb.1983) (citations omitted); Milene Music, Inc. v. Gotauco, 551 F. Supp. 1288, 1292 (D.R.I.1982) (citations omitted). The court finds and rules that plaintiffs are entitled to summary judgment. They have demonstrated the absence of any disputed facts with respect to the above enumerated elements for copyright infringement.
The first three elements of copyright infringement have been established through submission of photocopies of the certificates of Copyright Registration for the compositions at issue and the parties' further stipulation that such copies prove plaintiffs' copyright proprietorship. See e.g. Blendingwell Music, Inc. v. Moor-Law, Inc., 612 F.Supp. at 480 (""registration certificates of copyright constitute prima facie *633 evidence of originality, authorship, and compliance with statutory formalities, 17 U.S.C. § 410(c)"").
The fourth element is similarly established through the unrebutted affidavits of ASCAP's representatives who sat through performances of the compositions on January 11, 1985. The performances were indisputably for defendants' profit as the music performed was an integral part of defendants' business; patrons had to pay a cover charge to hear the performances, and defendants sold liquor during the performances. Id.; Warner Bros., Inc. v. O'Keefe, 468 F. Supp. 16, 20 (S.D. Iowa 1977).
The last element in a copyright infringement action is also established. Mr. Yee acknowledged at his deposition that he had not sought nor received permission from plaintiffs to perform their compositions. Nor did defendants possess an ASCAP license at the time of the alleged infringement. ASCAP's fruitless licensing attempts are well documented in the record. Accordingly, the court finds that copyright infringement in this case has been established.
Defendants raise basically two arguments in opposition to plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment. First, defendants contend that Mr. Yee, individually, cannot be held liable for the infringement, and second, that plaintiffs should be estopped from asserting a copyright infringement claim due to the impropriety of ASCAP and its representatives in seeking a license from defendants. The court finds these arguments to be without merit.
It is well established that a corporate officer will be liable as a joint tortfeasor with the corporation in a copyright infringement case where the officer was the dominant influence in the corporation, and determined the policies which resulted in the infringement. See Famous Music Corp. v. Bay State Harness Horse Racing and Breeding Association, Inc., 423 F. Supp. 341 (D.Mass.1976), aff'd, 554 F.2d 1213 (1st Cir.1977). It is similarly established that ""`one may be vicariously liable if he has the right and ability to supervise the infringing activity and also has a direct financial interest in such activities.'"" Boz Scaggs Music v. KND Corp., 491 F. Supp. 908, 913 (D.Conn.1980) (quoting Gershwin Publishing Corp v. Colombian Artists Management, Inc., 443 F.2d 1159, 1161-62 (2d Cir.1971)). In the present case, there is no dispute that Mr. Yee, as sole shareholder, president, treasurer and director of the Mai Kai was the dominant influence in the corporation and developed the policy for provision of live musical entertainment resulting in the copyright infringement. In addition, he certainly had the right and ability to supervise the musical performances, and he certainly profited financially from the musical performances. The performances generated income for the Mai Kai from which he received a monthly salary. Accordingly, Mr. Yee, personally is jointly liable with defendant Mai Kai for the copyright infringement.
Defendants next argue that plaintiffs should be estopped from raising the infringement claim because of ASCAP's improprietous actions in pursuing a license. Mr. Yee, at his deposition, testified that he felt the proposed license fee was unreasonably high and that he orally expressed this concern to ASCAP's representatives. According to Mr. Yee, no one explained his right to appeal the reasonableness of a license fee to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York pursuant to the Amended Final Judgment in United States of America v. American Society of Composers, Authors and Publisher, et al., Civil Action No. 13-95 (S.D.N.Y. March 4, 1950) (amending a 1941 consent decree). Paragraph IX (A) of that decree provides in pertinent part:
ASCAP shall, upon receipt of a written application for a license for the right of public performance of any, some or all of the compositions in the ASCAP repertory, advise the applicant in writing of the fee which it seems reasonable for the license requested. If the parties are unable to agree upon a reasonable fee within *634 sixty (60) days from the date when such application is received by ASCAP, the applicant therefor may forthwith apply to this Court for the determination of a reasonable fee and ASCAP shall, upon receipt of notice of the filing of such application, promptly give notice thereof to the Attorney General.
Mr. Yee's alleged ignorance of ASCAP procedures is not supported by the record before this court. Evidence pertaining to the other Mai Kai restaurants in New Hampshire are relevant regarding Mr. Yee's relationship with ASCAP and his knowledge of their proceedures. Thus, such evidence will be considered by the court.
The record reveals that ASCAP and Mr. Yee have a history dating back almost a decade relating to ASCAP's pursuit of a license for Mr. Yee's other restaurants. In correspondence dated July, 1979 to Mr. Yee, ASCAP sought a license agreement for Mai Kai of Dover, Inc. and included in that correspondence was a fully detailed brochure about ASCAP and its licensing procedures including the ability to appeal the reasonableness of a fee. Mr. Yee's memory is apparently selective when it comes to ASCAP procedures. The record reveals that ASCAP did successfully pursue a license for the Dover Mai Kai, despite periodic defaults by Mr. Yee. ASCAP acknowledges its previous relationship with Mr. Yee in its March, 1983 letter initially seeking a license for the Mai Kai in Concord. Therein it is written:
Since we have had numerous dealings in the past, it will be unnecessary for me to go into a lengthy explanation about ASCAP the United States copyright Law and musical performances as they relate to your establishment.
The numerosity of dealings is undisputed and Mr. Yee cannot now argue estoppel in light of the information about ASCAP previously provided him.
In rejecting defendant's estoppel argument, the court notes further that ASCAP, in the majority of its correspondence dating from March, 1983 to the initiation of suit, advised Mr. Yee that if he desired additional information about ASCAP, he need only write to ASCAP and his questions would be promptly answered. See correspondence dated March 13, 1983, September 10, 1983, December 5, 1983, January 26, 1984, May 25, 1984, July 23, 1984 and September 6, 1984. Mr. Yee chose to ignore this advice, which is not surprising considering his testimony that he did not even bother to read the letters from ASCAP but rather set them aside because he knew ASCAP wanted money for a license. While it is true that he orally expressed his concern about the license fee to an ASCAP representative, Mr. Yee's cavalier attitude about ASCAP's myriad correspondence and his total lack of vigor in pursuing his complaint with ASCAP militates against the equitable relief he now seeks.
Plaintiffs, having prevailed on their motion for summary judgment and establishing that defendant's infringed their copyright in eight instances, seek injunctive relief, monetary damages, costs and attorneys fees. The court deals with the requested relief seriatim.
Injunctive relief is available to a prevailing party in a copyright infringement action. 17 U.S.C. § 502(a). An injunction will issue when there is a ""`substantial likelihood of further infringement of plaintiffs' copyrights.'"" Rare Blue Music, Inc. v. Gotauco, 551 F.Supp. at 1295). Defend-(D.Mass.1985) (quoting Milene Music, Inc. v. Gotauco, 551 F.Supp. at 1295)). Defendants herein argue that injunctive relief is not warranted since an ASCAP license was obtained in October, 1985. The court finds the decision in Milene Music, Inc. v. Gotauco instructive wherein Judge Selya of the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island rejected a similar argument in an infringement action.
In Milene Music, the defendants argued that injunctive relief should not issue because they were, at the time of the court's decision, in compliance with ASCAP's requirements, having paid license fees to permit performances of plaintiffs' copyrighted compositions. The court, notwithstanding such current licensure, restrained and enjoined *635 the defendants after considering defendants' historical difficulties with ASCAP.
The scope of the court's injunction is noteworthy.
The history of defendants' actions, however, as chronicled in the pleadings, exhibits an unfortunate tendency conveniently to ignore, from time to time, both ASCAP and the plaintiffs' proprietary rights. As the Court has hitherto noted, these rights are proprietary in nature, and are deserving of protection. To guard against future encroachment, the Court will permanently restrain and enjoin defendants, and all persons acting under the direction, control, permission or authority of defendants, from publicly performing the aforementioned compositions or any of them, and from causing or permitting the said compositions to be publicly performed at [defendants' premises], or in any place owned, controlled or conducted by defendants, and from aiding or abetting the public performance of such compositions in any such place or otherwise, directly or indirectly, in violation of the Act.
Milene Music, 551 F.Supp. at 1295-96.
In the present case, defendants checkered history of compliance or lack thereof with ASCAP requirements leads the court to conclude that an injunction should issue. ASCAP labored unsuccessfully over two years to license defendant Mai Kai; the Mai Kai of Dover, Inc. has on several occasions since 1977 breached and defaulted under an ASCAP licensing agent, the most recent default occurring on January 1, 1986. Defendants have exhibited ""an unfortunate tendency conveniently to ignore"" plaintiffs' proprietary rights. Accordingly, an injunction is hereby issued this day permanently enjoining defendants and all persons acting under their direction or control, from publicly performing or causing to be performed the subject compositions at the Mai Kai of Concord, Inc., or any other establishment owned or controlled by defendants, and from aiding or abetting the public performance of said compositions in any such place, directly or indirectly, in violation of Title 17 of the United States Code. Without this sanction, the court is concerned that there would be substantial likelihood of further infringement of plaintiffs' copyrights.
Plaintiffs also seek statutory damages pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 504(c)(1). This section of the Copyright Act provides that a copyright owner may elect to recover, instead of actual damages, ""an award of statutory damages for all infringements involved in the action, with respect to any one work, ... for which any two or more infringers are liable jointly and severally, in a sum of not less that $250 or more than $10,000 as the court considers just."" Plaintiffs here seek statutory damages of $1,000 per infringement, for a total of $8,000 in damages.
The amount of statutory damages to be awarded in a copyright infringement action under 17 U.S.C. § 504(c)(1) is left to the sound discretion of the court. Rare Blue Music, Inc. v. Gutadauro, 616 F.Supp. at 1530. The court will consider certain factors in making an award determination including (1) the expenses saved and the profits reaped by defendants in connection with the infringement; (2) lost revenues to the plaintiffs; and (3) whether the infringement was willful and knowing, or whether it was accidental and innocent. Id. (citations omitted). Courts have placed great emphasis on the element of intent, with the award increasing proportionally with defendant's blameworthiness. Milene Music, Inc. v. Gotauco, 551 F.Supp. at 1296 (citations omitted).
Defendants' blameworthiness here is significant. They avoided paying an ASCAP license for over two years. The license fee finally accepted in October, 1985 was $1027. Thus, the court surmises that for the period in question defendants avoided paying over $2,000 in license fees. In addition, defendants' conduct from 1983 to 1985 demonstrates an intentional violation of plaintiffs' copyrights by virtue of the total disregard for ASCAP's licensing efforts. Defendants conduct is rendered *636 more egregious since Mr. Yee was familiar with ASCAP and the licensing procedure from his experience as owner of the Mai Kai of Dover, Inc. He had in fact licensed that establishment in the past.
The court must consider also that defendants did finally procure an ASCAP license in October, 1985 and that the loss of revenue to plaintiffs is not substantial. Based upon the above considerations, as well as the deterrent value of statutory damages, the court concludes that an award of $550 for each of the infringing acts is just and proper. See Rare Blue Music, Inc. v. Guttadauro, 616 F.Supp. at 1531 ($1,000 per infringement where knowing violation); Blendingwell Music, Inc. v. Moor-Law, Inc., 612 F. Supp. 486 ($500 per infringement where knowing violation); Milene Music, Inc. v. Gotauco, 551 F.Supp. at 1297 ($625 per infringement where knowing violation).
Finally, plaintiffs seek costs and attorney fees. Counsel for plaintiffs has submitted an affidavit indicating costs totalling $259.75 for filing and service fees as well as stenographic services. Said affidavit also indicates counsel's hours spent in preparing this case and his fee for services ($3,450). It is accepted practice for courts to award costs to prevailing copyright owners in actions such as this. See Milene Music, Inc. v. Gotauco, 551 F.Supp. at 1297. The court cannot discern any reason to deviate from that practice in this case and accordingly, will award costs and attorneys fees.
An award of attorneys fees is permitted under 17 U.S.C. § 505 to a prevailing party in a copyright infringement case and such award and its amount rests within the sound discretion of the court. Milene Music, 551 F.Supp. at 1297 (citing (Quinto v. Legal Times of Washington, Inc., 511 F. Supp. 579, 581 (D.D.C.1981)). In determining the amount of fees that should be awarded the court will consider, among other things, counsel's time and labor, the complexity of the case, the amount recovered, and the reasonableness of the time spent by counsel. 551 F. Supp. at 1298. After weighing these factors, this court is satisfied that plaintiffs' requested fee of $3,450 is fair and reasonable. Accordingly, this court awards to plaintiffs $3,450 in attorneys fees and $259.75 in costs for a total of $3,709.75.
In conclusion, the court finds that plaintiffs are entitled to judgment as a matter of law since the undisputed facts reveal that defendants violated Title 17 of the United States Code by infringing plaintiffs' copyrights. Plaintiffs are entitled to statutory damages of $4,400 (8 infringements, $550 per infringement), costs of $259.75 and attorneys fees of $3,450. Damages, costs and attorneys fees, therefore total $8,109.75.
SO ORDERED.

9325303,9329986,66633502,Commonwealth v. Stevens,Commonwealth v. Stevens,"
Campbell, P. J.,
— On January 22, 1966, a corporal of the Pennsylvania State Police clocked defendant traveling at a speed of 60 miles per hour in a 35 mile speed zone. At the conclusion of the chase, defendant was stopped by the officer for the purposes of identity and to get the necessary information with which to file a speeding charge. On February 3, 1966, the trooper filed an information with a justice of the peace charging defendant with violating section 1002(b) (4) of The Vehicle Code of April 29, 1959, P. L. 58. Defendant was sent a notice to appear by the justice of the peace on February 4, 1966, and on February 23, 1966, defendant waived a hearing and posted bail for his appearance in the court of quarter sessions. The court heard the matter on March 25, 1966, and adjudicated defendant guilty and ordered payment of the appropriate fine and costs. Defense counsel filed a motion in arrest of judgment asking the court to arrest the judgment and discharge defendant for the following reasons: (1) that the trooper failed to file an information against defendant within 72 hours, as provided in section 1201(c) of The Vehicle Code, 75 PS §1201; (2) that the notice to appear sent by the justice was not in the form required by law; (3) that the information does not allege that the trooper was in uniform and that the Commonwealth failed to prove that the trooper was in uniform, as required by section 1201 (c), 75 PS §1201, and section 1214 of the code, 75 PS §1214.
Without going into elaborate detail and discussion, it is quite clear that there are two methods by which the provisions of The Vehicle Code may be enforced. One is by the filing of an information within 15 days. The second is by an arrest on view, as provided by *250sections 1201 (c) and 1214 of the code. The procedure in each case is outlined in detail in section 1202. The procedure in the instant case was by the filing of an information. No arrest on view is involved. In such case, the officer has 15 days in which to file the information. The 72-hour requirement is only applicable when an arrest on view is involved.
Defendant contends that the notice to appear does not meet the requirements of the law. We believe that it does comply, but even though we concede that the notice was defective, this contention is entirely without merit. Defendant voluntarily placed himself before the court by his appearance when he waived a hearing before the justice of the peace and posted an appearance bond: Commonwealth v. Davidson, 412 Pa. 279. The aforerecited case involves the identical factual situation which we have here.
The final objection of defendant is that the information did not allege, nor did the Commonwealth prove, that the State policeman was in uniform when he stopped defendant. A close reading of the enforcement provisions of the code quite clearly indicates that he need only be in uniform when making an arrest on view: See Godsey v. Commonwealth, 103 Pitts. L. J. 143. There are no statutory provisions which require the Commonwealth to allege and prove that the State police officer was in uniform when he proceeds in his enforcement duties by the filing of an information and where no arrest on view is involved.
We, therefore, enter the following order:
And now, to wit, June 14, 1966, defendant’s motion in arrest of judgment is dismissed and judgment of sentence is entered, and defendant is ordered to pay a fine of $10, the costs of the justice of the peace and the costs of this appeal.
And now, to wit, June 14, 1966, an exception is noted and bill sealed for defendant.

Defendants’ only point on appeal says Notice to Quit was served after the action was commenced, and hence was ineffective. This is not so. There was a previous case filed, but obviously abandoned. In the instant case, the notice was served on August 17, 196S, and a complaint followed on November 2nd, and under such circumstances defendant cannot assert that the August notice related back to a previously abandoned complaint, — particularly in view of the fact that such urgence was made, not in the record, — but for the first time on appeal.

JONES
v.
JONES
[No. 31, September Term, 1970.]
Court of Appeals of Maryland.
Decided October 20, 1970.
The cause was submitted on brief to HAMMOND, C.J., and BARNES, McWILLIAMS, FINAN, SINGLEY, SMITH and DIGGES, JJ.
Submitted by Joseph R. Tyrrell, Jr., and William F. Higgins for appellant.
No brief filed on behalf of appellee.
SMITH, J., delivered the opinion of the Court.
Appellant Donal A. Jones (husband) here seeks to have the interest of husband and wife in a draft payable to him and his wife, the appellee Alice V. Jones (wife), and their attorney declared to be owned by the parties as tenants by the entireties. The draft in question was issued in settlement of the wife's claim relative to injuries sustained by her in an automobile accident and the husband's claim for reimbursement of certain medical expenses paid by him. We shall affirm the decree of the chancellor.
The accident in question took place in January of 1968. Eight days later both parties signed an agreement retaining an attorney. The husband and wife subsequently separated. They ultimately entered into a voluntary separation agreement. The agreement has all of the earmarks of having been prepared by the parties without the assistance of counsel. It made no reference to the damage claim. In September of 1969, five and a half months after the separation, settlement was effected.
The husband and wife could not agree as to the allocation between them of the sum collected. The wife retained other counsel and instituted a declaratory judgment *338 action to determine the ownership of the funds. The sum of $755.00 in medical expenses was paid by the attorney from the sum received in settlement. The parties were agreeable to this payment and the payment of the attorney's fee. There then remained $4,710.67, the subject of this litigation. The chancellor directed disbursement of $4,340.76 to the wife and $369.91 to the husband in accordance with stipulation that husband paid this sum for medical expenses.[1]
The husband contends that the sum obtained in settlement was owned as tenants by the entireties and, therefore, that this sum cannot be divided. For this reason he says the court lacked jurisdiction.
The husband cites in support of his position Brewer v. Bowersox, 92 Md. 567, 48 A. 1060 (1901), which held that a tenancy by the entireties might be created in personal property, and Schilbach v. Schilbach, 171 Md. 405, 189 A. 432 (1937), for the proposition:
""A tenancy by the entireties is essentially a joint tenancy, modified by the common law theory that the husband and wife are one person. 1 Tiffany on Real Property, 645. Except for the fact that it cannot be defeated, during their lives, without the joint action of both, the same rules of law apply to it as to any other cotenancy."" Id. at 407-08.
From there he moves on to Kolker v. Gorn, 193 Md. 391, 67 A.2d 258 (1949), which he dubbed ""a controlling case"", citing the comment:
""Where the conveyance is to husband and wife and a stranger, without qualifying words, it is the common-law rule that husband and wife take one-half as tenants by the entireties and the third party takes the other half as tenant in common. Haid v. Haid, 167 Md. 493, 175 A. 338; *339 Bartholomew v. Marshall, 257 A.D. 1060, 13 N.Y.S. 568. See also Tizer v. Tizer, 162 Md. 489, 492, 160 A. 163, 161 A. 510 and Baker v. Baker, 123 Md. 32, 90 A. 776."" Id. at 397.
The holding in that case was that a conveyance to ""John M. Gorn, Samuel G. Gorn and Margaret A. Gorn, his wife, as joint tenants, and not as tenants in common their assigns, the survivors or survivor of them, and the survivors' or survivor's heirs and assigns, in fee simple"" with a habendum clause reading, ""the parties of the second part as joint tenants, and not as tenants in common, their assigns, the survivors or survivor of them, and the survivors' or survivor's heirs and assigns, forever, in fee simple"" created a joint tenancy because there were qualifying words.
We do not regard any of these holdings as controlling here. It is true that Maryland has recognized that there may be a tenancy by the entireties in personal property. In Haid v. Haid, 167 Md. 493, 175 A. 338 (1934), a motor boat which a husband insisted be titled in the name of husband and wife and a third party was held to vest an undivided one-half interest in the husband and wife as tenants by the entireties and the other undivided one-half interest in the third party as a tenant in common with the husband and wife. When a husband deposited money in a savings bank to the credit of himself and his wife without reserving the right to withdraw the fund from the bank it was held in Baker v. Baker, 123 Md. 32, 40, 90 A. 776 (1914), to constitute a tenancy by the entireties. In Banking & Trust Co. v. Neilson, 164 Md. 8, 164 A. 157 (1933), the dispute concerned ownership of rent from land owned by husband and wife as tenants by the entireties. It was held that the rents were owned as tenants by the entireties and were therefore not subject to attachment for the debt of the husband.
Since the passage in 1899 of what is now Code (1957), Art. 45, § 5, a wife has been permitted to maintain a separate suit for torts committed against her. Sezzin v. Stark, *340 187 Md. 241, 49 A.2d 742 (1946). Previously it was necessary that her husband join in any suit for tort committed against her. In Clark v. Wootton, 63 Md. 113 (1885), decided prior to that act, there was an attempt made to reach by way of attachment the interest of the husband in a judgment obtained by the husband and wife against a railway company for injuries sustained by the wife. Our predecessors, after observing, ""Independently of his wife, the husband had no cause of action whatever for personal injuries to her, and in this respect his rights were different from those which he had in a certain class of choses in action of his wife, on which he might sue without joining her in the action"", held the judgment thus obtained for personal injuries sustained by the wife was protected by the constitutional provision that the property of the wife should be protected from the debts of the husband.
When a husband and wife purchase real estate and it is conveyed to the two of them as tenants by the entireties there is a positive direction for the creation of the estate. If one spouse has contributed the entire purchase price, then by directing that it be titled as tenants by the entireties he has manifested a positive intent to create the estate. Likewise, the creation of a bank account as in Bowersox and Baker calls for positive action, thereby evidencing an intent to create a tenancy by the entireties. When the boat was titled in Haid the husband directed the official to register the boat as being owned by him and his wife and his son, an intent relative to title being thereby shown. Similarly, when a testator devises real estate to husband and wife he presumably knows the law and the land is transferred to those parties accordingly. In each of these examples an intent to transfer can be determined.
Here we have a situation in which husband and wife retained an attorney to represent them relative to claims arising out of the accident. The wife had a claim for her personal injuries. The husband had a claim for the sums expended by him on behalf of his wife as a result of the *341 personal injuries. Had a suit been filed and judgment obtained a judgment would have been entered in favor of the wife and the wife alone for her personal injuries. Likewise, a judgment would have been entered in favor of the husband and the husband alone for the amounts he expended on behalf of his wife for medical expenses. We perceive no evidence of an intent to create a tenancy by the entireties. The act of obtaining an attorney to represent both of them falls far short of being evidence of such an intent. The act of hiring an attorney did not constitute a transfer of the interests the parties had previously held.
The settlement check or draft was in a lump sum drawn to husband, wife, and attorney because each of them had an interest in that draft. This act is not comparable to the situation existing when a check is drawn to husband and wife in payment for real estate owned by them as tenants by the entireties, nor is it comparable to the situation existing when one spouse deposits funds in a bank in both names, thereby manifesting an intent to create a tenancy by the entireties. In that the funds would retain the character of ownership they had prior to the drawing of the draft, it is comparable to a situation such as that in Banking & Trust Co. v. Neilson, supra, where funds coming out of tenancy by the entireties property were held to be likewise owned as tenants by the entireties. It is also similar to Brell v. Brell, 143 Md. 443, 122 A. 635 (1923), where the Court was concerned with ownership of funds deposited in a bank account in the husband's name alone. The funds came from sale of a farm owned by the parties as tenants by the entireties and a purchase money mortgage executed to husband and wife. The Court said:
""As the farm and mortgage belonged to them as tenants by the entireties, they have the same title to the two sums in bank, with the right of the survivor to take the whole."" Id. at 450.
Upon the authority of Masterman v. Masterman, 129 Md. *342 167, 98 A. 537 (1916), where the Court was dealing with the disposition of the proceeds of a fire insurance policy which covered property held by the husband and wife as tenants by the entireties, the Court said:
""[A] trustee should be appointed by the court below in this case to receive the two sums deposited in the Calvert Bank, and invest the same under the order of said court; one-half of the net income received therefrom to be paid to each party until the death of one of them, and the corpus to be paid to the survivor, unless sooner distributed by agreement of the parties."" Id. at 451.
See also Hammond v. Dugan, 166 Md. 402, 411, 170 A. 757 (1934), where the intent of the parties was taken into consideration in determining ownership of bearer bonds.
Here there is no evidence of any intent on the part of the wife or husband that these claims be transferred into a tenancy by the entireties. The drawing of a draft to husband, wife and their attorney, in effect ""as their interest may appear"", was not a transfer of the wife's prior individual claim so as to vest title to that claim in her and her husband as tenants by the entireties. Therefore, the chancellor correctly concluded that the claims remained in their original ownership and no tenancy by the entireties was created.
The husband urges that we lack jurisdiction to decide the matter, a point apparently not raised in the trial court. Under Maryland Rule 885 we do not ordinarily decide any point or question that does not plainly appear by the record to have been tried and decided by the lower court. An exception is made, however, in the matter of jurisdiction, since jurisdiction cannot be conferred on the Court by waiver or consent of the parties.
The husband points out that Code (1957), Art. 16, § 29 states:
""Whenever a court shall grant a divorce a mensa et thoro or a divorce a vinculo matrimonii, *343 it shall have the power to hear and determine all questions which may arise between the parties to such proceeding in connection with the ownership of personal property (except chattels real) held, possessed or claimed by either or both of them, and shall have the power to make a division of such property between them, or order a sale thereof and a division of the proceeds of such sale, or make such other disposition thereof as the court may deem proper.""
He then contends that this statute ""is the only basis for the distribution of personal property held as tenants by the entirety in the State of Maryland"", citing the holding in Schwartzman v. Schwartzman, 204 Md. 125, 102 A.2d 810 (1954), in which this Court said:
""It is still the law that a court of equity has no authority to adjust the property rights of a husband and wife in the absence of specific statutory authority."" (citing authorities) Id. at 134.
The Court was there referring to a wife's request for sale of jointly owned personal property.
He has correctly stated the law, but he has misconstrued what the chancellor was requested to do. The court was requested to make neither a division of property between husband and wife nor a sale of property with a division of the proceeds of sale, but to declare the ownership of the sum recovered by way of settlement. This Court has recognized that either the husband or the wife may sue the other and maintain an action in a court of equity for the protection of his or her property. Fernandez v. Fernandez, 214 Md. 519, 135 A.2d 886 (1957); Smith v. Smith, 211 Md. 366, 127 A.2d 374 (1956); Cochrane v. Cochrane, 139 Md. 530, 534, 115 A. 811 (1921); and Masterman v. Masterman, supra. Cf. Bowis v. Bowis, 259 Md. 41, 267 A.2d 84 (1970), and Gebhard v. Gebhard, 253 Md. 125, 252 A.2d 171 (1969). Moreover, it has recognized a difference between sitting as a divorce court and *344 sitting in the exercise of its ordinary chancery jurisdiction. Brucker v. Benson, 209 Md. 247, 250, 121 A.2d 230 (1956).
This action was brought in equity for a declaration of the rights of the parties. The court clearly had jurisdiction.
Decree affirmed; appellant to pay the costs.

7026239,7119109,64107468,People v. Harper,THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF ILLINOIS v. WILLIE HARPER," JUSTICE EGAN delivered the opinion of the court: A jury convicted the defendant, Willie Harper, of aggravated criminal sexual assault and armed robbery. He was sentenced to concurrent terms of 20 years’ imprisonment on each charge. He contends that trial errors require a new trial. He does not question the sufficiency of the evidence. A.L., the victim, left her home in Chicago Heights at approximately 10:40 p.m. on May 22, 1989, and walked toward Wentworth Avenue, where there was a large amount of drug traffic. She was looking for her brother, who had been recently released from a drug rehabilitation program. She was 20 years old and lived with her parents. As she walked toward Wentworth Avenue she saw a man she later identified as the defendant standing near a gate in front of a house. She had never seen him before. He was wearing colorful print shorts and a net-type tank top. She could see him well because there was a streetlight by the house. When she saw him, she crossed to the other side of the street to get away from him. She was watching him while she crossed the street and saw him turn toward her. He began walking toward her and said, “I got a package^ h]ow much money you got.” She told him she did not take drugs and continued watching him. He was directly under a streetlight when he asked her about buying drugs. She began backing away from him, but he “started coming steady walking towards [her]”; she eventually turned and started to run away from him as he chased her. He caught her near a community center a short distance from the house where she had originally seen him and “put something sharp to [her] neck.” She began screaming, but he told her he would “cut” her if she was not quiet. He asked her if she had any money, and she took $5 from her jacket pocket and gave it to him. He reached into her pocket and took out some coins. He dragged her around the community center building, through several fence openings, and took her to a nearby wooded area. While dragging and pushing her toward the wooded area, he told her to duck her head down toward the ground whenever they heard noises. Each time she ducked, they “were close and his head would look around” toward her. Her face was only a few inches from his and she could see his hair and the scar on his nose. She noticed the scar, his moustache and goatee and his “Bronx” style haircut. In the wooded area, he told her to remove her clothes, and he took off his clothes. She believed that he was under the influence of drugs at the time because of the appearance of his eyes. He then forced her to have oral and vaginal sex with him. She “was just hysterical by that point,” and when he allowed her to get up from the ground, she dressed, leaving her underwear on the ground, and ran home. Her underwear was later recovered in the wooded area. A.L. ran up the stairs to her house screaming and crying; her mother asked her what had happened. According to both A.L. and her mother, who also testified, A.L. told her mother that she had been raped, that she did not know the rapist, but that she could identify him if she heard his voice or saw his face. Her mother called the police. Police officers Rice and Garcia arrived at A.L.’s house early in the morning of May 23, 1989, and took her to the wooded area and then to the hospital. She gave the police a description of the defendant’s clothes and voice and told them that she “could describe him on his voice alone.” She also talked to the police at the hospital. She talked to Rice and Garcia approximately one hour after the incident, and although she was “halfway calmed down,” she was “not completely” composed but told the officers about the defendant “the best way [she] could that night.” She explained that she did not tell the officers “a whole lot of things” during the initial interview. She could not remember if she told them about the defendant’s nose scar, but she believed she told them about the defendant’s hair cut, moustache and goatee. After she left the hospital, A.L. went to the police station and talked to Detective Pinnow. She did not tell Pinnow her attacker had a scar on his face, but she told him she could identify him by hearing his voice or seeing his face. She described his shorts and shirt, and stated that he was black, had a Bronx haircut, was 26 or 27 years old, and had a husky, solid build. She looked through three or four “mug books” but did not select any individual as her attacker. She did choose facial features from an “Ident-A-Kit” used to make composite sketches in an attempt to make a picture of the defendant. She was not satisfied with the resulting sketch, although she believed Pinnow took a picture of it. Pinnow told her to call the station if she remembered anything more, and on the following day, A.L. called Pinnow and told him that the rapist had a scar on his nose and that the sketch was not accurate. She explained that she remembered to tell the police about the scar on the following day because she had been able to sleep and thus was calmer and thinking more clearly. Detective Bohlen came to her house and showed her a strip of 12 pictures of black men. She knew two of the men pictured from the neighborhood and eliminated them from consideration. She identified the defendant as her attacker from a picture in the strip. On June 6, A.L. and her sister were driving on Wentworth Avenue when A.L. saw Harper walking on the street. She told her sister, “That’s him[, tjhat’s the guy right there.” She saw a man she knew named Bickham standing at the corner, and she asked Bickham to watch the defendant. She and her sister drove home to get their father. When she and her father and brother returned to Wentworth Avenue, the defendant was gone. Later that day a man from the neighborhood came to the house and told A.L.’s uncle that “the guy [they] were looking for” was on Wallace Avenue. She and her family drove to Wallace Avenue, where A.L. saw the defendant standing on a corner. She then drove to the police station. Her uncle left the car to alert the police, and A.L. drove back toward Wallace Avenue. When she approached the defendant again, he ran through a yard in a direction away from the police station, and A.L. saw the police arrest and handcuff him a few blocks from Wallace Avenue. She later identified the defendant from a lineup of five people held by Detectives Bohlen and Pin-now at the police station. The defendant had a goatee, a moustache, a Bronx haircut and a scar on his nose. Detective Pinnow testified that A.L. and her mother came to the police station on May 24 to tell him that her attacker had a scar on his nose. She never told them that the man had a moustache or goatee. He also testified that she was shown a strip of 12 pictures and that she picked out a picture of the defendant. When the defendant was arrested on June 6, 1989, he agreed to talk to Pinnow and Bohlen after being advised of his Miranda rights. He told Pinnow that he was in a drug rehabilitation center on May 22, 1989. The detectives investigated and determined that the defendant was not at the center on May 22. The defendant then told them he was either at his father’s house or his sister’s house on May 22. Jenny Hahn, a forensic scientist employed by the State Police Forensic Laboratory, examined blood and pubic hair samples from the defendant and A.L., and semen from swabs of A.L.’s mouth and vagina taken at the hospital and from A.L.’s clothes. Hahn found three pubic hairs in the sample from A.L. that were not consistent with A.L.’s hair. Two of those three hairs were not consistent with the defendant’s hair, and in her opinion came from a third person. The other “unknown” hair, however, had characteristics similar to the defendant’s hair and had no characteristics that were “markedly different” from the defendant’s hair. Therefore, Hahn could not rule out the defendant as the source of the unknown hair, although she could not definitely say that the hair came from the defendant. Hahn also testified that the “high concentration” of semen on the vaginal swab and on A.L.’s pants was consistent with the defendant’s blood. Therefore, Hahn concluded that the semen found on the vaginal swab and A.L.’s pants could have come from the defendant. Since there was a high concentration to analyze, Hahn was able to conclude, after several calculations that she outlined for the jury, that 4.2% of the United States black male population could have left the semen type on the vaginal swab and 3.1% of the United States black male population could have left the semen type found on A.L.’s pants. The defense was an alibi. The defendant’s mother, Josephine Harper, testified that on May 22, 1989, the family held a church choir cookout at her daughter’s home. The defendant attended the cookout, which began at approximately 5 p.m., with his girlfriend, Terri Baker. The defendant was upstairs watching a basketball game with other men until approximately 10:30 p.m. She testified that when the defendant left the cookout, he was with his girlfriend, his sister Brenda Carrell and her boyfriend Robert Davis. She next saw the defendant when he returned to her house in the “latter part of the morning” on May 23, 1989. The defendant’s sister, Bobbie Bell, testified substantially the same as her mother. The defendant’s other sister, Brenda Carrell, and his girlfriend, Terry Baker, both testified. They said that they left the cookout in Baker’s father’s car with Robert Davis and the defendant at approximately 10:30 p.m. Baker said that, during the cookout, the defendant was upstairs with the other men and did not leave the house before 10:30 p.m. The group drove into Chicago; Davis was driving. Carrell explained that the purpose of the trip was for Davis to obtain money from a friend in Chicago. Both women testified that the tire on the car became damaged on an expressway, forcing the group to pull off the highway, take the car to a gas station, and then slowly drive the car away from that gas station to a different gas station. They left the car at the gas station, walked to the “el,” took the el to the bus station at 95th Street, and then took a bus to 127th Street. They obtained a ride home when Davis flagged down a car and offered the driver money to take them back to Chicago Heights. It was after 6 a.m. the following morning when they returned to Chicago Heights, and the driver took Davis and Carrell to Bell’s house and Baker and the defendant to the defendant’s mother’s house. Robert Davis also testified for the defendant. He admitted having three felony convictions, including a 1984 conviction for voluntary manslaughter. He testified that during the cookout the men were watching a Bulls game upstairs, and he later stated the game was between the Bulls and the Detroit Pistons. He could not remember exactly what time most events of the evening occurred, and could not be sure exactly what day of the week May 22 was but assumed it was a Sunday. (May 22, 1989, was a Monday.) He did not remember telling State’s Attorney Investigator Dwayne Holbrook the cookout was on a Saturday. Investigator Holbrook later testified that Davis did tell him the cookout was on a Saturday. Davis testified that the group left Bell’s at approximately 11 p.m. and had car tire trouble on the expressway. He first explained that the group took the el, then got a ride from a friend to the bus station at 95th Street. They took a bus to 127th Street, where he flagged down a car and paid the driver to take them back to Chicago Heights. On cross-examination he said that the group walked to the el station, but did not take the el. When asked about this inconsistency with his direct examination testimony, Davis said, “I don’t even remember that far back.” Also on cross-examination, Davis said that the men watched several basketball games and that they did not necessarily watch the Bulls. When the prosecutor asked him about his earlier testimony regarding the Bulls game, Davis said, “[0]nly speculation you could be correct *** I don’t have total recall.” The defendant first contends that reversible hearsay evidence was introduced during the testimony of A.L. She testified that she saw the defendant walking up Wentworth Avenue. She drove up to the corner and saw Bickham. She told Bickham, “That’s the guy. That’s the one who raped me. Watch and see where he go[es].” A.L. testified that she went home to get her father, spoke with her father and brother and that they went back to Wentworth Avenue. The defendant was gone. She then testified as follows: “STATE’S ATTORNEY: What was is — after you looked for him there, what was it that you did then? A. The guy that I asked to keep an eye on him, he said he knew him. DEFENSE ATTORNEY: Objection, Your Honor. Hearsay. STATE’S ATTORNEY: Listen to my question. After you didn’t see him, did you go anywhere after that? A. I went straight back to the guy, and I asked him where did he go, and he said— DEFENSE ATTORNEY: Objection to what the person said. THE JUDGE: Basis of what? DEFENSE ATTORNEY: Hearsay. THE JUDGE: That’s overruled, counsel. A. He said that he called him. He said ‘Hey, Willie man, come here, and he said, “what man, what, man. I ain’t did nothing,” and ran into someone’s house.’ ” (Emphasis added.) The State now contends that the testimony of the conversation between Bickham and A.L. was used to show the effect Bickham’s statement had on her. The State says that “the information which Bickham gave to A.L. was relevant to show why she could not find defendant and had to stop searching and return home.” We are not persuaded of the tenability of the State’s argument. What Bickham allegedly told A.L. could be considered evidence of a consciousness of guilt on the part of the defendant. Her subsequent action of going to the police station was not probative and could have been explained if she had simply testified that the defendant was gone or, at most, that Bickham told her he had gone.  We do not believe, however, that the evidence was prejudicial. We note first that the evidence came out in unresponsive answers by A.L. Second, this was a strong identification case which was substantially corroborated by scientific evidence. In addition, A.L.’s testimony itself established flight by the defendant just before he was arrested, and the police officer’s testimony that the defendant made a false statement to him about his whereabouts at the time of the crime could be considered evidence of consciousness of guilt. Last, the trial judge made a strong statement to the jury that the evidence was not to be considered for the truth of the statement made by Bickham. Consequently, we find no reversible error in the admission of this testimony. The defendant next contends that prejudicial error occurred during the cross-examination of the defense witnesses, Davis and Carrell. During her direct examination, Carrell explained that the only purpose Davis gave the group for going into Chicago was that he needed to pick up money from a friend. On cross-examination she repeated that Davis told her and the others that Davis was going to pick up money. The following occurred: “STATE’S ATTORNEY: He of [sic] mention you guys weren’t going into Chicago to pick up marijuana, were you? DEFENSE ATTORNEY: Objection, your Honor. STATE’S ATTORNEY: Judge, I can tie it up. I’ll prove it up. THE JUDGE: Sustain.” After Carrell’s testimony, the defense made a motion in limine to preclude the State from questioning Davis about the purpose of the trip into Chicago, arguing that the purpose was irrelevant to the alibi. The prosecutor said the evidence that the trip was to obtain marijuana was being offered only to impeach the testimony of the defense witnesses, including Carrell. The judge agreed to permit the prosecutor to ask Davis about the trip’s purpose but the prosecutor could not tell Davis how to answer. The judge stated, “[I]f you want me to instruct the jury [the evidence] is to be used only for impeachment purposes, I will be glad to do it.” The defense attorney did not ask for such an instruction but insisted that his motion in limine be granted; the judge denied the motion.  When Davis was being cross-examined, he admitted that he went into Chicago to purchase marijuana, but also explained repeatedly that the others did not know his true purpose. He stated, “This has nothing to do with [the defendant]” and noted, “[T]hey didn’t know what I was going for.” Again we do not find any prejudicial error. The defense opened the door to some extent by eliciting from Carrell evidence that the purpose of the trip was an innocent one; it would appear that if the prosecutors had evidence to the contrary, they should not be required to sit by without attempting to disabuse the fact finder of the impression created by Carrell’s direct examination. It is the general rule, however, that impeachment must be relevant. We agree that the purpose of the trip to Chicago was not relevant, and the State should not have been permitted to bring out the fact that the purpose of the trip was to pick up marijuana. But again, we do not believe the evidence was prejudicial to the defendant. Evidence of narcotics was already in the record to a substantial degree. A.L. had testified that there was a large amount of drug traffic on Wentworth Avenue, that her own brother had recently been released from a drug rehabilitation program, and that the defendant appeared to be on drugs at the time of the crime. The defendant originally told Officer Pinnow that he was in a drug rehabilitation center on the day of the offense. Most important, her testimony established that in her initial encounter with the defendant he was attempting to sell her narcotics. Additional evidence that Davis was going to buy marijuana could not have inflamed the jury. For these reasons, we hold that any error was harmless. The defendant’s last contention is that reversible error occurred during the State’s closing argument. During rebuttal argument the prosecutor said: “He knew they were looking for him, but he thought he got away with it. He didn’t think he left any evidence. He didn’t think his semen mattered. He didn’t probably know he was a secretor. He didn’t know he left a pubic hair.” A defense objection to the argument was overruled. Before that argument was made, the prosecutor also made the following remarks, to which no objection was made: “I submit to you, ladies and gentlemen, by listening to the forensic evidence that was presented in this case, this indicates that [the defendant] was with [A.L.] that night and had left these deposits. He left his concentration of semen and that *** is corroborative of the identification and the testimony of [A.L.]. He left the pubic hair *** [and e]very characteristic she observed was consistent, the unknown hair with the hair of [the defendant]. Corroborative evidence of what [A.L.] said.”  We believe that the prosecutor’s remarks to which the defendant objected were not improper. (See People v. Turner (1989), 128 Ill. 2d 540, 539 N.E.2d 1196; People v. Jimenez (1989), 191 Ill. App. 3d 13, 547 N.E.2d 616.) The case cited by the defendant, People v. Linscott (1991), 142 Ill. 2d 22, 566 N.E.2d 1355, is distinguishable. In that case, the prosecutor “made up” blood-analysis evidence that a vaginal swab indicated the victim could only have been raped by a nonsecretor, such as the defendant. (Linscott, 142 Ill. 2d at 37.) The prosecutor also “repeatedly” argued that hairs found near and on the victim’s body were conclusively from the defendant, despite expert witness testimony that “you cannot say that this hair came from this individual, only *** that it’s consistent.” (Linscott, 142 Ill. 2d at 30.) The Linscott prosecutor made a mathematical prediction about the probability that any other man left the hairs, which the supreme court found was not from the expert witness’ testimony and was “without foundation and *** patently inapplicable” to the case. Finally, thÃÂ© prosecutor stated several times that the hair found at the scene “matched” the defendant’s hair. (Linscott, 142 Ill. 2d at 33.) The supreme court reversed because of the misstatement of the blood-analysis evidence and the repeated misstatements indicating the hairs found conclusively were from the defendant, and that the misstatements were compounded by the erroneous mathematical prediction. In the case before us, the prosecutor’s argument, to which an objection was made, was prefaced by the prosecutor’s argument that the unknown hair was consistent with the pubic hair of the defendant. That argument was a correct description of the expert’s testimony. The defendant argues that reversible error occurred in the following closing argument by the State: “STATE’S ATTORNEY: [To acquit the defendant y]ou have to believe that [A.L.] is completely lying about this. DEFENSE ATTORNEY: Objection, your Honor. JUDGE: Overruled. STATE’S ATTORNEY: You have to believe there is no corroborative evidence. *** You have to believe that she is completely mistaken. That every time she took a look at this guy and put a finger to him that she was lying. Well, ladies and gentlemen, take a look into her eyes. She testified and stood here. Do you think she was mistaken? I submit to you, no way.” The defendant relies on People v. Cole (1980), 80 Ill. App. 3d 1105, 400 N.E.2d 931. In Cole, the prosecutor argued that, in order to acquit the defendant, the jury had to find that the complaining witness, three police witnesses and “the other witnesses of the State are lying.” (Cole, 80 Ill. App. 3d at 1107.) The appellate court ordered a new trial on the ground that the State’s argument was “such a misstatement of law as to prejudice defendant and deny him a fair trial,” citing two cases from the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals. (Cole, 80 Ill. App. 3d at 1108.) The court concluded that the jury could have believed that the complaining witness was telling the truth to the best of his recollection, but was merely mistaken when he identified the defendant. The State cites People v. Knott (1991), 224 Ill. App. 3d 236, 586 N.E.2d 479, appeal granted (1992), 145 Ill. 2d 640, 596 N.E.2d 634, in which the defendant was identified as a robber by two witnesses. He presented an alibi witness who said the defendant was with him at the time the crime was committed. The prosecutor argued: “[The alibi witness] isn’t lying. *** [But c]ould he be ten minutes, fifteen minutes off? To believe [the alibi witness’] times, okay, you have to totally disbelieve [the victims who identified the defendant].” Knott, 224 Ill. App. 3d at 256. The Knott court discussed Cole and other cases, and stated “courts have distinguished cases where the ‘contradiction could possibly be due to a witness’ mistake, as opposed to when the contradiction was almost certainly due to a witness lying.’ ” (Knott, 224 Ill. App. 3d at 257, quoting People v. Smith (1991), 209 Ill. App. 3d 1043, 1051-52, 568 N.E.2d 482.) The court explained that “[t]he key is to review the comment in context,” and distinguished Cole because the Knott prosecutor did not repeatedly tell the jury it must find the State witnesses lied, but qualified his statement by suggesting that the alibi witness was mistaken about the time. (Knott, 224 Ill. App. 3d at 258.) The Knott court held that the comments “did not rise to the level of prejudicial error.” (Knott, 224 Ill. App. 3d at 258.) The court concluded by stating that, “[i]n any event, any error would be harmless where the jury was properly instructed that closing arguments are not evidence.” Knott, 224 Ill. App. 3d at 258.  The facts of this case are closer to Knott than to Cole. The prosecutor’s remarks were equivocal in that he used both “lying” and “mistaken.” The judge also instructed the jury that closing arguments are not evidence. But we believe there is a more compelling reason to reject the defendant’s argument, and that is that we interpret the defense attorney’s argument to be an attack on the credibility of A.L. To use some but not all the examples illustrating the defense attorney’s questioning of A.L.’s credibility, he said that she was “familiar with drug dealers.” He also said that she had exaggerated her emotional state when she first talked to the police. He pointed out what he said were contradictions between A.L.’s testimony and that of the police officers and alleged contradictions between A.L.’s testimony on direct and on cross-examination. For these reasons, we find no error in the prosecutor’s closing argument.  The defendant’s last claim of error is that the judge improperly sustained several objections by the State during the defense’s closing argument and at the same time the trial judge made improper comments on the evidence. The defendant has referred to five specific instances in which the judge sustained objections by the State on the ground that the evidence did not support the defense attorney’s statements. It is clear to us that, in the five instances of which the defendant now complains, the defense argument was not based on the evidence or reasonable inferences from the evidence. We find no error in the judge’s rulings or comments. For these reasons, the judgment of the circuit court is affirmed. Judgment affirmed. McNAMARA, P.J., and RAKOWSKI, J., concur. "

DOERNER, Commissioner.
Plaintiff brought this action to recover damages of $7500 for personal injuries. At the close of plaintiff’s case the court direct*454ed a verdict in favor of defendant, upon which judgment was entered accordingly. Following the overruling of her after-trial motions plaintiff duly appealed.
Defendant is a common carrier of passengers for hire, operating for that purpose large automobiles known as “service cars” on the public streets of the City of St. Louis. On the evening of July 3, 1960, plaintiff, a woman 54 years of age, was a fare-paying passenger on one of defendant’s service cars, having embarked at Goode Avenue. She sat in the back seat, on the right hand side. To her left there was seated a man then unknown to the plaintiff, who was identified during the trial by one of her witnesses as Reverend Chisholm Jones, since deceased; and to his left sat another woman passenger. The car traveled east-wardly on Easton Avenue, and as it neared the intersection of Grand Avenue with that street, plaintiff notified the driver of her desire to get off at that point. No other passenger did so. When the car stopped at the southeast corner of the intersection Reverend Jones crossed in front of plaintiff, opened the right rear door, and got out. As plaintiff was in the act of following him out, Jones closed the door on plaintiff’s right leg. The evidence for plaintiff was that neither Reverend Jones, who walked away, nor the driver, who remained seated, came to her assistance, although she screamed from the pain. While the testimony of plaintiff’s doctor is not included in the transcript, her own testimony indicates that she sustained a fracture of the lower part of her leg.
Pointing to the testimony of one of her witnesses that it was the defendant’s custom to allow its passengers to open and close the car doors themselves, and to the absence of any evidence that plaintiff knew of the custom, plaintiff advances the following argument: first, that as a fare-paying passenger the defendant common carrier owed her a non-delegable duty to exercise the highest degree of care to afford her a reasonably safe opportunity and means of exit from its vehicle; and second, (and we quote) “Defendant chooses to operate its common-carrier vehicles under a custom or arrangement whereby it allows and permits its passengers to themselves open and close the exit doors on its vehicles; if defendant does not thereby delegate its nondelegable duty to exercise the highest degree of care to afford its passengers a reasonable safe opportunity and means of exit as a matter of law, and thereby render itself absolutely liable for the acts or omissions of its passengers which cause injury to other passengers, it thereby at least creates a jury issue as to whether it thereby does or does not exercise the highest degree of care to afford its passengers such opportunity and means.”
Assuming, without deciding, that the law is as stated by plaintiff, the fatal weakness in plaintiff’s position is that she did not plead or attempt to recover below on the theory now advanced in her argument on appeal. In her petition plaintiff did not refer to defendant’s custom of allowing or permitting its passengers to themselves open and close the exit doors of its vehicles, nor did she charge that defendant thereby failed to exercise the highest degree of care to afford plaintiff a reasonably safe opportunity and means of exit from its vehicle. All that plaintiff alleged in her petition was that the door was closed on her leg as the result of the carelessness and negligence of the defendant “by and through its agent, servant and employee” and that defendant “by and through its agent, servant and employee” was at all times therein mentioned in complete charge and control of the service car. In brief, plaintiff pleaded that the operator of defendant’s car closed the door on her leg, but her evidence failed to sustain her charge in that it showed that a fellow-passenger did so. It is elementary that in an action for damages for personal injuries the plaintiff, in order to recover, must make out a case against the defendant upon the particular charge or theory of negligence alleged in his petition as constituting the cause of action which the defendant will be *455called upon to meet, and he will not be permitted to recover upon proof of any other or different charge or theory, even though the same might suffice to have shown actionable negligence on the defendant’s part if properly pleaded.

OPINION

. FUTEY, Judge.
This contract case is before the court after a trial on the merits. Plaintiff contracted with defendant for the construction of a relocatable, tensioned fabric structure. One year after final acceptance of the finished structure, one part of the building collapsed. Defendant invoked the Warranty Clause stating that the collapse was caused by a latent defect, and requested plaintiff repair the structure. Plaintiff disagreed, stating that tornadic like winds caused the collapse. Plaintiff agreed to repair the dome, but only at additional cost to defendant. Defendant terminated plaintiff’s contract for default and removed the entire structure, offsetting part of the cost from a separate contract with plaintiff.1 Plaintiff alleges that its contract was improperly terminated for default, but defendant counters that the termination was proper and seeks reimbursement for the cost of the contract, plus additional expenses.

Factual Background

On March 27,1986, defendant, the Department of Defense, Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), Defense Industrial Plant Equipment Center (DIPEC) issued Solicitation No. DLA002-86-003, inviting fixed-price bids for the supply and erection of two relocatable, tensioned fabric structures of at least 24,000 square feet each or, alternatively, one relocatable, tensioned fabric structure of at least 55,000 square feet. The structure was intended to protect 55-gallon containers of haz*628ardous and flammable liquids stored at the Defense Depot Memphis, Tennessee (DDMT).
Plaintiff, Spandome, submitted a proposal to supply a single roof structure covering 55,332 square feet. The structure was to consist of two domes, adjacent to one another and connected by a strip of fabric called the “valley.” The structure was designed by the president of Spandome, Mr. Arpad Kolos-vary. Although he had vast experience in designing single dome structures, Mr. Kolos-vary testified at trial that he never designed and erected a tensioned fabric structure consisting of two domes with a connecting valley between them.2
Defendant awarded the contract to Span-dome on April 21,1986. Spandome erected a two-dome fabric structure at the DDMT, completing it by July 22,1986. Final inspection was completed and the project was finally accepted on the same day.3
A snow storm on January 6 & 7, 1988, deposited snow in the valley of the Spandome structure (Spandome I) at a depth of approximately two feet.4 The snow melted and accumulated in the valley center with no outlet or drainage. As a result, the fabric in the valley stretched and weakened. Another heavy rainfall on the morning of January 19, 1988, caused more water to collect in the stretched pocket of the fabric.
Evidently the government was aware that Spandome I was in a weakened state. On the morning of January 19,1988, representatives of the government, Mr. Gray and Mr. Spurlock, went to observe the dome. Specifically, Mr. Gray testified that he was asked by his supervisor to “go out and see if the Spandome is still standing.”5 The men arrived at the site of the structure sometime between 7:20 and 7:45 a.m. They testified that it was raining, but they did not notice any wind.6 The men did notice a bulge sinking down in the center of the valley, apparently the water accumulated in the valley and caused the fabric to sag.7 The men also testified that there was no tension in the valley cables.8
At approximately 8:00 a.m. on January 19, 1988, the north dome of Spandome I collapsed. Defendant’s witness, James A Jackson, a National Weather Service official, indicated that 1.55 inches of rain fell on the morning of January 19, 1988 (before the 8:00 ÃÂ°. m. collapse). Defendant further states the weather data provided that winds that day were moderate, averaging about 15 miles per hour (m.p.h.) with maximum wind gusts of 30 miles per hour. Defendant maintains that there was no mention of a tornado in this weather data.
Coincidentally, on the morning of the collapse, Mr. Kolosvary, the President of Span-dome, was en route to the site in order to inspect the structure where the water and snow had accumulated. After arriving to find the collapsed structure, defendant’s representatives advised plaintiff to call an independent firm to assess the situation. Plaintiff selected a local Memphis engineering firm, The Pickering Firm, to examine the structure. The chief branch engineer of that firm concluded after investigation that “wind forces much greater than the building code required for design of the structures ... triggered the collapse.”9
Plaintiff maintains that strong winds and heavy rain prevailed in the early morning hours, just prior to the collapse. Plaintiff states that a tornado watch was in effect in the Memphis and Shelby County area, and *629was upgraded to a tornado warning at or about the time of the collapse. Plaintiff maintains that the collapsed structure showed evidence that it was hit by a tornado.
On February 1,1988, the Contracting Officer (CO) invoked the Warranty Clause of the contract claiming that there was a latent defect in the structure, and requested that Spandome submit a plan of corrective action toward restoration of the structure in accordance with contract requirements. On February 15,1988, plaintiff sent a letter protesting the invocation of the warranty. Defendant maintains that Spandome did not offer any plan of correction in that letter.
On February 29, 1988, the CO sent plaintiff a cure notice. Plaintiff responded on March 18, 1988, enclosing a statement which alleged that a tornado had hit the structure causing it to collapse. Additionally, plaintiff requested the government specify latent defects in the structure’s design.
On March 25, 1988, defendant revoked acceptance of Spandome I based on the existence of a latent defect, and executed a partial default termination. Defendant informed plaintiff that a final determination had not been made as to whether it’s failure to perform was excusable, but that a final determination would be made after receipt of the engineering report on the cause of the collapse.
Defendant prepared two final engineering reports, a Forensic Study of Tensioned Fabric Structure at DDMT prepared by Garver & Garver, PA, and Evaluation of the Collapse of the Tensioned Membrane Fabric Structure at DDMT, prepared by the Department of the Army, Construction Engineering Research Laboratory (CERL). Both reports concluded that design defects caused the failure of the double-domed Span-dome I structure. Preliminary reports made by both Garver & Garver and CERL also stated that design defects caused the collapse. On July 6, 1988, plaintiff objected to the government’s course of action, disagreeing with the findings of both reports.
By final decision of October 6, 1988, based on physical evidence, witness reports, and’ technical findings, the CO found that plaintiff’s failure to perform its contract did not arise out of causes beyond its control or without its fault or negligence.
On February 13, 1989, the CO issued a final decision which determined total, non-excusable default termination, invoked final revocation of acceptance, and elected to demand dismantling/removal of Spandome I from the Depot. The CO assessed damages against plaintiff in the amount of $525,013, based on plaintiff’s failure to properly perform the contract. Both the contractor and the government exchanged correspondence regarding dismantling the remaining dome. It appears the parties were attempting to negotiate a removal plan; however, on May 25, 1989, defendant contacted plaintiff by both mail and phone, advising that the remaining dome was to be dismantled by May 26, 1989. Plaintiff was unable to respond in the 24 hour period allotted, and the government removed the remaining dome on May 26, 1989.
Defendant maintains that the defects existing in the structure were not diseernable upon reasonable inspection. Thus, defendant believes that it was justified in its revocation of acceptance pursuant to FAR 52.246-2 (Inspection of supplies-fixed price). Further, defendant believes it properly invoked FAR 52.249-8 (Default) which was incorporated by reference into both the contract for the structure and the awning. Defendant avers that plaintiff failed to demonstrate that its failure to perform the contract arose from the causes beyond its control and without fault or negligence.

Discussion

I. The Collapse
On January 19,1988, at approximately 8:00 a.m., the north dome of Spandome I collapsed. The only eyewitness to the collapse presented at trial was Mr. Charles Wallis. Mr. Wallis, DDMT’s Chief Fire Inspector, was driving to Spandome I at that time to check the drain pipes.10 Mr. Wallis testified that he was 100 to 150 yards from *630Spandome I when it collapsed.11 Mr. Wallis stated that the southwest corner of the north dome appeared to fall first, followed by the remainder of the dome.12 Mr. Wallis also testified that the weather he observed at the time of the collapse was light to moderate rain, but he did not view any wind or any condition associated with tornadic activity.13
Mr. Kolosvary, however, testified that the winds were so strong that his flight into Memphis was delayed from landing that morning.14 Plaintiff maintains that winds exceeding 100 m.p.h. were responsible for the collapse of Spandome I at the Defense Depot on January 19, 1988. To support its theory, plaintiff presented the testimony of Mr. Jack Scott of the Pickering Firm. Plaintiff hired Mr. Scott immediately after the collapse to determine the cause of the failure. Mr. Scott testified to the location and condition he found the structure, and concluded that “a large upward force” had caused the damage to the cables and tripods, which ultimately led to the collapse.
To refute plaintiffs theory that a tornadic wind was the cause of the failure, defendant’s witness, Mr. James Jackson from the National Weather Service, objectively interpreted documented data on the weather patterns of January 19, 1988. In his testimony, Mr. Jackson examined all available data, but he could find no sign of tornadic activity on or near the Depot on January 19, 1988, around 8:00 a.m. On cross examination, the most favorable testimony plaintiff could evoke from Mr. Jackson was the fact that there were reports of tornados touching down that day in neighboring counties. There was no evidence, however, that any tornado, or even strong winds, touched down in Shelby County where the Depot is located.
Based on the testimony of Mr. Jackson and the documentary evidence, the court finds that the collapse of the north section of Spandome I was not due to tornadic activity. The overwhelming objective evidence can lead to no other result. Although the court acknowledges many instances of severe weather, such as the unusual amount of snowfall recorded earlier that month, or even the impressive amount of rain that fell the morning of the collapse, there is simply insufficient evidence that winds greater than 100 m.p.h. caused, the failure. Mr. Kolos-vary’s testimony that his flight was delayed in landing provides the court with little information. Instead the reliable records of the weather service and the independent impartial testimony of Mr. Jackson convinced the court that a tornado or tornado like winds were not responsible for the failure.
II. Latent Defect
Defendant claims that the collapse was a result of latent defects. In order to negate the effect of final acceptance, the government must first establish the existence of a defect. United Technologies Carp. v. United States, 27 Fed.Cl. 393, 398 (1992). A latent defect is one that would not have been discovered by reasonable inspection. Kaminer Construction Corp. v. United States, 203 Ct.Cl. 182, 191, 488 F.2d 980 (1973). In order to revoke acceptance of the supply, the government must assert its claim in a timely manner, and prove by a preponderance of the evidence that a latent defect existed at the time of final acceptance which was hidden from knowledge as well as sight, and could not be discovered by the exercise of reasonable care. United Technologies, 27 Fed.Cl. at 398. Defendant claims that the inspection in this case was reasonable, and could not have revealed the latent defects in Spandome I. Defendant believes that government reliance on Spandome’s expertise in fabric tensioning structure design led them into entering a fixed-price contract, and that plaintiff should therefore bear the risk of design defects. See e.g., United Technologies, at 400-01. The contract must provide for post-acceptance recovery. United Technologies, 27 Fed.Cl. at 399-400. Inclusion of the standard Inspection Clause allowing defendant to set aside final acceptance based on “latent defects, fraud, or such gross mistakes *631as amount to fraud” satisfies this requirement. Id. at 400.
To support its theory that a latent defect was responsible for the collapse, defendant presented the expert testimony of Mr. Chris Anastos. Mr. Anastos is a licensed structural and civil engineer. He was employed between 1978 and 1984, by a firm which specialized in tension fabric structures, where he gained experience erecting these structures. Mr. Anastos continued building these structures until 1990.
Mr. Anastos was not retained by the government until the fall of 1992. In preparation for his testimony he reviewed the government contracts, the correspondence files, and specifications for the project. He also reviewed plaintiffs correspondence, design submittals and the computer analysis. He reviewed the weather reports from the storm on January 6 & 7, and for January 19 as well as newspaper reports from that day. He reviewed photographs of the structure before and after the collapse as well as a video of the structure after the collapse. Additionally, he reviewed four separate reports examining the cause of the collapse: one by the Pickering firm; one by Spandome; one by CERL; and, one by Garver and Garver. Finally, Mr. Anastos made two visits to the site: one in November 1992; and, one in December 1992.
A Design Submittals
Mr. Anastos cited errors and deficiencies in plaintiffs design submittals. Mr. Anastos criticized the computer modeling of the structure. He found it crude and simplistic, improperly analyzing the structure as it was built.15 Mainly, the problem was that plaintiff did not consider in its design the interdependency of a two dome structure with a connecting valley. Instead, plaintiff based its analysis on one separate dome with quarter symmetry. This presupposes a uniform response of the entire valley based on the computations of one comer. Mr. Anastos averred that this was a fatal flaw because the valley is totally independent of the structure.16
The second problem had to do with arch tilt. Arch tilt is the out-of-plane rotation of the arch.17 Mr. Anastos testified that Span-dome relied very heavily on arch tilt to balance unbalanced loads.18 Mr. Anastos stated, however, that the design submittals did not actually analyze arch tilt by computer or even hand analysis for the structure. Basically, Mr. Anastos charged that plaintiff simply concluded, with no accompanying analysis, that arch tilt will balance all unbalanced loads.19
Thirdly, Mr. Anastos found that the arch was not built as it was analyzed. Specifically, it was analyzed as a single member, but in reality it was comprised of a lot of separate members.20 Mr. Anastos contended that proper analysis would include all the members in the computation. Finally, Mr. Anas-tos testified that he could find no analysis whatsoever on the effect of safety cables.21
B. Detailing the Spandome I Structure
Mr. Anastos, explained that detailing is “basically putting all the pieces together and figuring out how the elements will be connected and designing that connection and drawing it up.”22 Typically this occurs at the end of the analysis.
Mr. Anastos charged that the structure, as designed, showed the fabric going over the arches, where in reality it was connected to the arches.23 This was problematic because the bolt that the cable bears against was put in a distance away from the edge of the cable. Consequently, the fabric pulled on the cable, and the bolts pushed through the fab*632ric.24 Thus, in order to engage the bolt, the fabric had to move, eventually initiating tears in the fabric.25 Additionally, the fabric bore against the edge of the angle of the bolt, which was' not rounded, but beveled. The fabric hitting the bevelled edge also caused tears. Thus, the fabric’s strength was tremendously weakened by the rips.26
The third problem was with the cables themselves. Mr. Anastos testified that when a cable moves there is a certain radius with relationship to the diameter of the cable that must be rounded so it won’t damage the strands of the cable.27 The building code requirement for the use of cable in other buildings is about a 13 to 15 inch radius; in Spandome I, it was a one inch radius. Mr. Anastos believed that the failure of any one of these cables would cause a collapse.28
Finally, Mr. Anastos testified that the connection of the safety cable to the arch truss was inadequate.29 The purpose of the safety cable is to hold up the arch in case of an arch rip. Mr. Anastos stated that the eye bolt, as installed, only had 800 pounds capacity to keep a 20,000 pound arch from falling down in the event of a major tear or rip.30
C. Collapse Scenario
Mr. Anastos theorized for the court what happened on the morning of January 19, 1988. Based on eyewitness statements and photos, and interviews, Mr. Anastos estimated that the load on January 19, 1988, was 74.000 lbs., but since some of the snow had melted etc., he reduced the figure down to 61.000 lbs.31 Mr. Anastos established that the load in the valley pulled the arches in the center which stretched the fabric. The interior arches of the dome moved inward while the exterior arches moved away from each other in response to the load. The exterior tripod legs were then put in tension. Due to the stress, the preexisting tears grew into a major rip, which released a great deal of energy leading to the dynamic reaction. The eye bolt snapped, and the arch fell. The safety cable was of limited use because it only had a capacity of 800 lbs, but the estimated force on the cable was about 12,000 lbs.32 Mr. Anastos concluded that “the pond-ed water coupled with the tears in the fabric created loads and stresses on the Spandome that led to its collapse.”33
D. Plaintiff’s Response
Mr. Arpad Kolosvary testified as an expert on behalf of his company. In response to Mr. Anastos’ charges, Mr. Kolosvary began with defending his calculations of the snow load in the valley. Mr. Kolosvary visited the site on January 8 or 9, before the collapse to view the “bagging” of snow in the valley which resulted from the previous day’s snow showers. Mr. Kolosvary testified that he did in fact calculate it being necessary to carry a load in the valley, but that the calculations may not have all been included in the design submittal.34 Nevertheless, when he visited Spandome I before the collapse, he recognized that the fabric deflected considerably more than he calculated.35 He defended his structure’s design, arguing that the sag was caused by misrepresentations of the manufacturer of the fabric, and that it is not customary to test every piece of fabric used.36 Mr. Kolosvary acquiesced, however, that the defect in the fabric would still be his responsibility.37
Mr. Kolosvary determined that some remedial measures would have to be taken in *633order to make up for the elongation in the fabric, however, he did not believe there was any structural consequence of the large bag in the valley.38 Mr. Kolosvary also testified to the preexistence of tears in the fabric before the collapse, but insisted that the tears did not endanger the structure.39 Further, he determined “by looking up” that there was not a problem, and that he would return to repair it when the snow melted.40 This is in contrast to the testimony given by Mr. Anastos, whose response would have been to immediately repair the rips and have the snow and water removed from the valley.41
In defense of his attachment of fabric to the arch, Mr. Kolosvary explained that there are various permissible methods, and that he has used this technique for twenty years. Mr. Kolosvary demonstrated that he pulls the fabric over where the bolt will be and makes an incision.42 The slit is opened over the bolt, and then the cable is pulled down, but it does not bear against the knot as Mr. Anastos demonstrated. The hole, however, is not big enough to get down past the knot, and thus the fabric bears on the round bolt, not the sharp knot.43
On the issue of arch tilt, Mr. Kolosvary initially stated that it was not proposed in the design submittal. He stressed, however, that one was prepared. Mr. Kolosvary testified that he does not typically submit less than the critical load conditions.44 Nevertheless, he complied when he was later asked to submit the analysis. On cross examination, however, Mr. Kolosvary testified that in his computer analysis he did not analyze for arch tilt.45 Further, he testified that in the computer analysis he did not analyze for asymmetrical snow load46 Moreover, Mr. Kolos-vary never gave a full response regarding his calculations for load in the valley. It re-mains unclear whether he only evaluated one quadrant, or whether his analysis considered the entire valley.47
As the court previously determined, the collapse of Spandome I did not result from severe winds. Further, the court accepts the government’s theory that the load of the ponded water created extreme tension which eventually caused the fabric to malfunction. What must be determined, however, is whether these circumstances resulted from a latent defect in plaintiffs design.
The court finds the evidence given by Mr. Anastos credible and convincing. Mr. Kolos-vary failed to properly analyze for arch tilt, but only relied on it as a theory. This led to latent defects in the structure. Depending on his assumptions, Mr. Kolosvary did not account for the unbalanced loads which accumulated in the valley, consequently leading to the collapse. Additionally, the safety cables were not designed to withstand the load which accumulated in the valley and could not serve their function in response to the energy released when the north dome finally collapsed. The court agrees that these miscalculations were latent design defects which were not discoverable by reasonable inspection.
Furthermore, both parties agree that the structure did not behave as guaranteed. The water should not have ponded in the valley, but should have run off the sides. Whether or not it is Mr. Kolosvary’s custom to test every piece of fabric, he admitted that the “flexibility” of the fabric was not predicted. As previously discussed, Mr. Kolosvary testified that he understood that he was fully responsible for any defects in the fabric; and, even though the water ponded in the valley, that load, theoretically, should not have resulted in the large deflection in the fabric. Therefore, Mr. Kolosvary should have taken steps prior to the collapse to *634repair, not only the sag in the valley, but, the tears in the fabric as well. Nonetheless, it is likely that the same circumstances would have reoccurred due to the inherent defects.
III. Post Acceptance Rights
The contract included Warranty Clause FAR 52.246-21. 48 C.F.R. § 52.246-21 (1985). The court finds, however, that this warranty is no longer applicable because it only continued “for a period of 1 year from the date of final acceptance of work ...” § 52.246-21(b). Because Spandome I was-finally accepted on July 22,1986, the warranty no longer applied on January 19, 1989. Under sub-paragraph (h), however, “[i]n the event the Contractor’s warranty under paragraph (b) of this clause has expired, the Government may bring suit ... to enforce a subcontractor’s, manufacturer’s, or supplier’s warranty.”
Assuming § 52.246-21(h) applies, the government could take advantage of the contractor’s warranty for the “fabric canopy and related components” for a period of five years, agreeing to “repair or replace any work which deteriorates excessively (i.e. at a rate which will reduce the specified service life or render the structure unfit for intended use) or otherwise fails to perform as required due to failure of materials or workmanship.” The contractor’s warranty is specific, and does not afford the same rights and obligations as Warranty Clause FAR § 52.246-21. Strictly construing Spandome’s warranty, the.contractor was only obligated to repair or replace the goods; therefore, based on a breach of warranty, the government cannot recover any other costs. See O.F. Paulsen Constr. Co., 79-1 BCA 1T 13,623, 1978 WL 2486 (1978) (rental costs of replacement generator were not included among remedies in guarantee clause, therefore, they were not recoverable); Kalcor Coatings Co., 75-2 BCA ¶11,422, 1975 WL 1419 (1975) (warranty gave government right to either correct, replace, or dispose of defective goods and charge the costs to contractor; refund of the purchase price was not included as one of the remedies and, therefore, was not allowed).
The government can still recover other costs, however, based on the “Inspection of Supplies — Fixed Price” clause, FAR 52.246-2 (APR 1984), which was also incorporated into the contract. This clause requires the government to accept or reject supplies as promptly as possible after delivery. Most importantly it states that “acceptance shall be conclusive, except for latent defects, fraud, gross mistakes amounting to fraud, or as otherwise provided in the contract.” It also provides that if acceptance is not conclusive:
“the government, in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law, or under other provision of the contract, shall have the right to require the contractor (1) at no increase in contract price, to correct or replace the defective nonconforming supplies at the original point of delivery or at the Contractor’s plant, at the Contracting Officer’s election, and in accordance with a reasonable delivery schedule as may be agreed upon between the Contractor and the Contracting Officer; provided, that the Contracting Officer may require a reduction in contract price if the Contractor fails to meet such delivery schedule; or (2) within a reasonable time after receipt by the Contractor of notice of defects or nonconformance, to repay such portion of the contract as is equitable under the circumstances if the contracting officer elects not to require correction or replacement.
(k) ... Acceptance shall be conclusive, except for latent defects, fraud, gross mistakes amounting to fraud, or as otherwise provided in the contract.
(l) If acceptance is not conclusive for any of the reasons in paragraph (k) hereof, the Government, ... shall have the right to require the contractor (1) at no increase in contract price, to correct or replace the defective or nonconforming supplies ... or (2) within a reasonable time after receipt by the Contractor of notice of defects or nonconformance, to repay such portion of the contract as is equitable under the circumstances if the Contracting Officer elects not to require corrections or replacement.”
*635Under the Inspection Clause, the government usually seeks to have the contractor repair or replace the defective work. Kaminer v. United States, 203 Ct.Cl. 182, 488 F.2d 980 (1973). If, as in this case, the contractor refuses to correct the defect, the government may do so and recover any reasonable cost incurred. Kordick & Son, Inc. v. United States, 12 Cl.Ct. 662 (1987). Upon proper revocation of acceptance, the government also has the right to return the items to the contractor and demand the return of the purchase price. Catalytic Engineering & Manufacturing Corp., 72-1 BCA ¶ 9342,1972 WL 20918 (1972). The material must be returned to the contractor unless it is utterly worthless. Teltron Inc., 72-2 BCA ¶ 9502, 1972 WL 1267 (1972). Even if the items are worthless, the contractor should be credited with the scrap value. Atlantic Hardware & Supply Corp., 66-1 BCA ¶ 5378, 1966 WL 358 (1966).
Although the government originally partially terminated this contract for default on March 25, 1988, the entire contract was terminated for default on February 13, 1989. At that time, the government notified the contractor to take action to remove the remaining dome, which continued to stay erect after the January 19, 1988, collapse. Curiously, the government waited until May 26, 1989, (16 months later) to dismantle that dome. Evidently, the government had full use of the dome until that time. Apparent from the parties’ correspondence, there was discussion of removing the remaining structure beginning in February 1989. In Ms. Dubose’s letter notifying the contractor that the entire contract has been terminated for default, plaintiff was also informed that Ms. Dubose was happy to “discuss your arrangements for a timely removal of the structure, But unless such arrangements are confirmed within ... 10 days ... and preceding March 20, 1989, I will be forced to purchase the removal work for your account.” On March 3, 1989, Mr. Kolosvary responded and referenced a meeting (tentatively set for March 17) in Memphis “to negotiate a termination settlement and to discuss the removal of the berme area Spandome.”48 On April 10, 1989, another letter from Mr. Kolosvary offered to dismantle the remaining one half of the original structure as part of a $20,000 settlement. On May 25, 1989, however, Spandome was notified that the structure would be taken down the next day.
This notification was inadequate. While the contractor believed he was still negotiating a settlement, a one day notice was issued to dismantle the structure or be faced with removal costs incurred by the government. Defendant waited 16 months before taking any action toward dismantling the remaining dome. The testimony offered at trial convinced the court that the structure was in no danger of immediate collapse. Instead, it is evident that the government no longer had a use for the remaining dome and wanted it removed. Defendant’s telephonic notice giving the contractor 24 hours to remove the structure was clearly insufficient. Therefore, the contractor is not responsible to the government for those costs.

Conclusion

The court has determined that the Span-dome I contained latent design defects. Therefore, the government was within its right to require corrective action upon discovery of those defects. Because the contractor did not offer a plan of repair, the government is entitled to demand return of the purchase price, as well as any costs associated with cleanup from the collapse. Moreover, a termination for default has also been upheld where the contractor fails to correct or replace the items. Jo-Bar Manufacturing Corp., 73-2 BCA ¶ 10,311, 1973 WL 1705 (1973).
Regardless of the remedy selected by the government, the contractor will be credited with the benefit which the government has obtained from the use or retention of the defective product. Midwest Industrial Painting Inc., v. United States, 4 Cl.Ct. 124 (1983). The contractor will receive credit for the government’s use of the entire structure from July 22, 1986, through January 19, *6361988, as well as its use of the remaining dome until it was removed on May 26,1989.49
Additionally, the government did not return the material to the contractor. The parties must determine the reasonable value of that material. If the parties' agree that the material was worthless, the contractor should be credited with its scrap value.
The government requested this court award interest from the time the default termination was rendered. Awards of interest to the government are discretionary with this court. Astro—Space Laboratories, Inc. v. United States, 200 Ct.Cl. 282, 312, 470 F.2d 1003 (1972). Although interest began to run from the day the CO rendered her final decision, the propriety of the termination was not determined until the court rendered this opinion. Therefore, the court will not penalize the contractor for the time which was necessary to resolve this bona fide dispute. While judgment in this case is for defendant, the government is not entitled to interest. Further, the court remands the issue of damages to the parties to determine the amount, affording the contractor any allowances conferred by the court in this opinion. The parties shall file a stipulation as to the amount of damages payable to the government within 60 days from the date this opinion is issued. Upon receipt of the stipulation, the Clerk of the Court is ordered to enter judgment for the defendant at that time without further order from the court. No costs.

. Although plaintiff originally questioned the propriety of the offset, the parties were assumed to have come to an understanding during a pretrial conference. In any event, the court finds that any questions regarding the administrative offset were rendered moot by the decision of the Federal Circuit in Cecile Indus., Inc. v. Cheney, 995 F.2d 1052 (Fed.Cir.1993).

Hall, Judge,
concurring specially. I reluctantly concur with the opinion for the reason that we are bound by the Supreme Court’s affirmance (Fields v. Goldstein, 214 Ga. 277, 104 SE2d 337) of Fields v. Goldstein, 97 Ga. App. 286, 288 (3) (102 SE2d 921). In my opinion, the better rule is that the question whether the failure to procure an adequate policy was due to the plaintiff’s own negligence in not reading his policy should be submitted to the jury. The following authorities support this view: Elam v. Smithdeal Realty & Ins. Co., 182 N.C. 599 (109 SE 632); Ursini v. Goldman, 118 Conn. 554 (173 A 789); Shapiro v. Amalgamated Trust & Sav.

8783133,8799016,66065133,Katin v. Apollo Savings,"Ernest KATIN v. APOLLO SAVINGS, Defendants FEDERAL SAVINGS AND LOAN INSURANCE CORPORATION, Receiver of Apollo Savings, a corporation v. Edward P. KELLY","
MEMORANDUM AND ORDER
CAMPBELL, District Judge.
This action arises out of the liquidation of an Illinois Savings and Loan Association, Apollo Savings (“Apollo”). Plaintiff, Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (“FSLIC”) is acting as Receiver of Apollo in a liquidation proceeding presently pending before the Circuit Court of Cook County. That receivership proceeding commenced on April 26, 1968 when the Commissioner of Savings and Loan Associations for the State of Illinois appointed a receiver to take custody of and to liquidate Apollo pursuant to the Illinois Savings and Loan Act. (lll.Rev.Stat. C. 32, par. 921). On May 2, 1968, the Attorney General of the State of Illinois, pursuant to the provisions of the Illinois Savings and Loan Act, filed a statutory complaint in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Chancery Division, seeking the liquidation and dissolution of Apollo. The cause was assigned to the Honorable Donald J. O’Brien, Presiding Judge of the Chancery Division of that court, and at the request of the Illinois Attorney General, Judge O’Brien entered a Decree ordering the liquidation of Apollo and directing its receiver to take custody and control of its assets and records for the purpose of liquidating the Association. At the request of the Attorney General, the Decree further, “restrained all persons from obtaining or attempting to obtain any judgment, attachment, encumbrance, or other like lien against or upon said association or any of its assets * * * while the same are in possession and control of said receiver or until further order” of the court.
The Decree also provided that the state court retained jurisdiction of the cause, “for the purpose of granting such other and further relief as said association, its members, said receiver, creditors, debtors, the public or others who apply to this court may require and in the judgment of this court merit.”
On September 30, 1968, the then acting receiver resigned and plaintiff FSLIC was appointed receiver. It is still acting in that capacity.
LITIGATION IN THIS COURT
(A) Katin v. Apollo.
On May 3, 1968, certain depositors-shareholders of Apollo brought an action in this court against Apollo and its Directors alleging various acts of mismanagement and violations of state law relative to the management of Savings and Loan Associations. Katin, et al. v. Apollo, et al., 68 C 808. Plaintiffs in Katin contend that these actions constituted a violation of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Basically, the relief sought is an award to each depositor-shareholder of “interest” or “dividends” for a period commencing when the last “interest” or “dividend” was paid and continuing up to the time each depositor was paid his principal by the FSLIC.1
In moving to dismiss the Katin case, FSLIC, as receiver of Apollo, stated that “stripped to its essentials”, the Katin case is a “classic case of corporaet mismanagement which can only be asserted *1057by Apollo Savings, through its receiver.”
FSLIC also argued that these claims alleging corporate mismanagement, arise under state law and are “cognizable under state law, but not under the (Securities) Act,” citing Mutual Shares Corp. v. Genesco, Inc., 384 F.2d 540, 546 (2nd Cir., 1967).
The initial filing of the Katin complaint was followed by numerous motions by the many defendants; by the filing of an amended complaint by plaintiffs; and finally, by the filing of this ease, FSLIC v. Kelly et al.
(B) FSLIC v. Kelly.
This case, a civil conspiracy, fraud and corporate mismanagement case, was brought by FSLIC against certain officers and directors of Apollo and certain other persons having major transactions with Apollo. It contains many of the allegations of corporate mismanagement contained in the Katin case. It is allegedly brought by FSLIC in its capacity as the state court receiver of Apollo and as an insurer subrogee. The only basis for federal court jurisdiction is the fact that FSLIC is a federal agency authorized to bring suit in federal court. See Acron Investments, Inc. v. Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation, 363 F.2d 236 (9th Cir. 1966).
The original complaint was filed October 29, 1969, and the amended complaint January 5, 1970. One defendant later filed a cross-claim. By April 22, 1970, most of the defendants had responded by answer or motion. At that time I ordered that the two cases (Katin v. Apollo and FSLIC v. Kelly) be consolidated for pretrial discovery and trial. I also advised counsel that I was considering the feasibility of proceeding with this cause under the enlightened and accelerated procedures established for protracted cases by the Judicial Conference in its Manual for Complex and Multidistrict Litigation.
In my review of the many pleadings filed by the various parties, I thought it clear that this Association, though properly in custody of the state, was not in the sorry financial condition of others we have dealt with. On the contrary, my first reaction to the issues in this case was that it appeared that here the dispute related to the proper disposition of potential surplus. Specifically, the plaintiffs in Katin argued that they were entitled to a first claim to the “remains” of the estate of the Association as their “loss of bargain”, whether it be legally defined as dividends or interest, for the last six months of the Association’s operation; certain officers and directors, generally referred to as the “Kelly interests” argued that any surplus should go to the owners of permanent reserve stock, 80 percent of which were owned by the Kelly interests; and FSLIC argued that any surplus must first go to pay “post-default interest” to the FSLIC, that is, interest on the money which FSLIC had paid to the insured depositors.
The various aspects of this ease were explored in detail in pretrial conference held with all counsel in both cases. When I expressed my views as to the proper method of proceeding in this case Mr. Merrill Shepard, counsel for FSLIC, —in urging the dismissal of the Katin case — stated that, in his opinion the Katin claim belonged in the state court because, “the determination as to who would be entitled to any surplus, as among all classes of claimants would necessarily rest with the court in which the receivership (was pending) * * * the State of Illinois.” Mr. Shepard also stated:
“Judge O’Brien, who has that case, ¿hat receivership, made it quite clear during a hearing at which Mr. Kirby and I participated that that was so. Whatever happened in relation to the proceedings here, the fund from which a judgment would be made, except for possible assets of the individual defendants, would be the fund in his charge. And I believe Mr. Kirby and I both agreed with Judge O’Brien when he made that observation.”
*1058Counsel for the “Kelly interests” agreed that Katin should be dismissed in deference to state court proceedings and further urged that all claims including that of the receiver FSLIC should be referred to the state court.
More interesting to me at that time, however, was that all counsel suggested the possibility of settlement — a possibility I wanted to fully explore before burdening this estate with the substantial expense involved in litigation as complex as this. It appeared to me that settlement would certainly serve the best interests of all depositors and the federal insurer, FSLIC. Accordingly, we agreed that separate pretrial conferences would be held with the various parties and the court would work closely with counsel for FSLIC in an attempt to settle each of the many claims presented.
At the outset of the settlement negotiations, I expressed my concern to counsel for FSLIC that any steps we take toward settlement must be consistent with the proceedings in the state court, as it is that court that has the ultimate responsibility to supervise the administration of this receivership and approve any settlement we might reach in this court. I was assured by counsel for FSLIC (as the state court receiver) that this case was instituted with the full knowledge and approval of Judge O’Brien — and with that assurance settlement negotiations commenced.
After numerous pretrial conferences with the FSLIC and the Kelly interests, tentative agreement was reached on that aspect of the case. The parties agreed that FSLIC would pay the Kelly interests 50 cents per share ($270,000) for their permanent reserve stock and dismiss the case as to them. I viewed this settlement as fair to all concerned. The $270,000 would be used to pay substantial liens on the stock, so that it could be delivered free and clear to FSLIC, thus assuring it of the most substantial share of the surplus. The remainder would ultimately go to the government by way of fines I intended to impose in a criminal case pending against Edward P. Kelly.
At this time I felt it my duty to advise Judge O’Brien, the Chancellor in the state court proceeding, of our settlement negotiations as it was he who had overall responsibility for the receivership estate and who by virtue of that responsibility must approve the settlements we had labored so long to achieve. Upon advising Judge O’Brien of our developments, I was shocked to learn that contrary to the representations of counsel, Judge O’Brien was not advised of this proceeding before it was filed in this court and did not approve of it having been so filed. I was further advised by Judge O’Brien that while he had every respect for our court, he felt it his responsibility to fully review the terms of any settlement before approving it particularly since he did not authorize the bringing of this case — in the first instance. And, while he did indicate tentative approval of the Kelly settlement, he did not encourage further proceedings in this court.
Parenthetically, I think it important to stress that we of this court have every respect for the ability and integrity of Judge O’Brien who served at the bar of this court as one of our most active and able trial lawyers for many years, and that I fully agree and approve of the attitude of the learned Chancellor with respect to this case. Having borne the burden of overseeing many receiverships and liquidations over the years, I fully appreciate his reluctance to act as a “rubber stamp” in approving whatever settlement we might view as in the best interests of the estate he has the duty to administer. With my own experiences in mind, I accepted and concurred in Judge O’Brien’s criticism.
Simultaneous with these developments were the developments in the attempted settlement of claims against certain other individual defendants and their enterprises, collectively referred to by counsel as Grizaffi and Falcone. Grizaffi and Falcone were contractors who obtained more than four million dollars in construction loans from Apollo. The receiver contends that these defendants, along with certain other persons, de*1059frauded Apollo, causing losses of more than one million dollars. In our first settlement discussion the receiver demanded in settlement a sum of $750,000. Grizaffi and Falcone then advised the court that they believed they had a valid and substantial claim against Apollo and would soon file a counterclaim. These defendants further suggested that they would accept $700,000 in settlement of their counterclaim.
The proposed counterclaim of Grizaffi and Falcone indicated not only that settlement negotiations might be much less fruitful than originally anticipated or at least more complex and thereby subject to perhaps complete de novo review by the state court Chancellor if these negotiations resulted in settlement, but more importantly, the counterclaim if presented in this court, would be in direct contravention of the state court injunction, “restraining all persons from obtaining or attempting to obtain any judgment * * * or like lien against or upon said association * * (Similarly, the FSLIC, in its corporate capacity — as opposed to its capacity as receiver — indicates that it intends to file a claim against the Association for interest on the insurance payments it has made to depositors.)
For the many reasons explained here, I advised counsel for the FSLIC that it appeared to me that there was no alternative but to reconsider the motions of certain defendants to dismiss this cause or to dismiss on my own motion, without prejudice to the rights of FSLIC and all other parties to prosecute their claims in the state court where the receivership was pending as ancillary proceedings in that receivership qualifying for immediate relief. Subsequently, counsel for FSLIC filed a brief expressing their reasons in support of their position that this action should not be dismissed. I have reviewed the arguments advanced in this brief and for the reasons I have stated and others I shall further state, find them totally unconvincing.
First, it should be stressed that there is no question but that all of the relief sÃÂ³ÃÂ¼ght here could be obtained in the state court proceedings. In fact, my experience in similar cases convinces me that the most expeditious manner of prosecuting claims of this nature, — i. e. all claims on behalf of or against the association in receivership — is to litigate these claims as ancillary to the receivership case and in the court where the receivership is pending. In Tcherepnin v. Franz, 316 F.Supp. 714 (N.D.Ill.1970), a case involving the liquidation of another savings and loan association of the State of Illinois (City Savings Association) I specifically instructed the receivers of the Association that all claims on behalf of the Association were to be litigated in this court as ancillary to the case in chief, and that, to the extent possible, claims against the Association were to be brought here. In accomplishing this important objective the judges of our state court, in a most gracious application of the principles of comity, have shown my receivers and our court every consideration. As recently as September 10, 1970, The Honorable Nicholas J. Bua of the Circuit Court of Cook County dismissed the case of Andover Advertising Company v. City Savings Association (67 L. 2949), when he was advised of my desire to litigate all claims against the Association in this court. Courtesies, based on comity, such as that extended by Judge Bua would not be so readily extended were it not for the fact that we judges of this court have over the years promoted the cooperative spirit based on mutual respect that presently exists between our courts, whether it be in the name of federalism, comity or simple common sense. Against .this setting, I consider the legal arguments presented by FSLIC.
FSLIC first argues that this court has a duty to adjudicate any cause brought within its jurisdiction and that “deference to a state court is an extraordinary and narrow exception to this duty * * justified only in exceptional circumstances”. To meet these extraordinary cir*1060cumstances, FSLIC argues that each of the following tests be met: (1) there must be uncertainty of state law; (2) state court adjudication must clearly serve an important countervailing interest, such as, a federal constitutional issue that may be mooted by state court determination of pertinent state law or exercise of federal jurisdiction would disrupt state administrative process or create needless friction by unnecessarily enjoining state officials from executing domestic policies. FSLIC further argues that “there is no way” a judgment or settlement in this case could disrupt or interfere with the state court receivership.
I disagree with its analysis of the law and its attempted application to the facts of this case. In my opinion the statutes relied on do not grant jurisdiction under the facts of this case. Furthermore, even were jurisdiction clear, settled principles of comity as well as sound judicial administration, dictate that this court refuse jurisdiction in this case.
For our dual court system to function properly, all needless friction between the state and federal courts must be religiously avoided. This principle is established by statute as well as by court decision. See Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Co. v. Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, 398 U.S. 281, 90 S.Ct. 1739, 26 L.Ed.2d 234 (1970). As explained above, the case in chief — the receivership —was first brought in the state court by the Attorney General of Illinois under his statutory authority. Upon the motion of the Attorney General, the state court judge to whom the case was assigned enjoined prosecution of all claims against the Association, and retained jurisdiction for the purpose of granting any other and further relief the receiver may require and in the judgment of that court merit. Now, I am confronted with complex litigation which involves claims against the Association contrary to the state court injunction, and also seeks relief by the receiver — although the state court specifically retained jurisdiction to grant said relief.
I am aware that the receivership in question is not a traditional court created equity receivership, but is an executive receivership, under which the receiver was appointed by the Commissioner of Savings and Loan Associations. (Ill. Rev.Stat. C. 32 ¶ 921). It is still the court which has, by statute and by its own decree, entered on motion of the state’s Attorney General, the overall supervisory responsibility over the estate in receivership. It is clear in this case —contrary to the representations of counsel — that the court with that authority and responsibility does not approve of the maintenance of this action. And, while FSLIC is a federal agency authorized to litigate its claims in a federal court, it is here as a state appointed receiver in a state court receivership subject to the supervision of a state court Chancellor. In short, while FSLIC as a federal agency may have Congressional authority to prosecute its claims in federal court, I do not believe that this power extends to the facts of this case wherein FSLIC, having sought and obtained appointment as receiver in a state court receivership, can now bring all the many ancillary claims of the receivership in this court contrary to the express desires of the court wherein the receivership is pending. I particularly note that FSLIC has advised the court and counsel that it intends to file still another claim in this court for post-default interest. This proposed ease is to be brought by FSLIC as a government agency and will be against FSLIC as state court receiver. Such a claim brought against the estate in receivership would clearly be in further contravention of the state court injunction. This type of controversy between our courts is not what Congress intended when it authorized FSLIC to bring suit in federal court (12 U.S.C. § 1730(k); 28 U.S.C. § 451) and to act as receiver in state court liquidations. (12 U.S.C. § 1729). I note particularly that FSLIC has stated, in this case as well as in support of its motion to dismiss the Katin case, that this “fraud” and “mismanagement” case is brought *1061in its capacity as receiver and on behalf of the association and its shareholders. Section 1730, subsection (k), above cited, specfically provides:
“That any action, suit or proceeding to which the Corporation is a party in its capacity as conservator, receiver, or other legal custodian of an insured State-chartered institution and which involves only the rights or obligations of investors, creditors, stockholders, and such institution under State law shall not be deemed to arise under the laws of the United States.”
By its own description this is such an action, brought not in its capacity as a federal corporation, but in its capacity as receiver, prosecuting rights of the association under state law. There is thus no statutory basis for the federal jurisdiction it demands I exercise.
I believe the conclusion I reach here is also consistent with settled principles of comity between federal and state courts. The receivership is proceeding before a state court which has plenary jurisdiction over the affairs of the receivership estate. This court has, at best, only partial jurisdiction. We may litigate only portions of claims— subject to the supervision of the state court. The state court first took jurisdiction over the receivership estate. Under the Illinois Savings and Loan Act it has the responsibility to supervise the dissolution of State Savings and Loan Associations. Under settled principles best expressed by the Supreme Court in Pennsylvania v. Williams, 294 U.S. 176, 55 S.Ct. 380, 79 L.Ed. 841 (1935) federal courts are admonished not to interfere with these dissolutions, though we may have “abstract” jurisdiction over the subject matter of certain claims.
The approach I take here is similar in theory to that taken by the Supreme Court in Toucey v. New York Life Insurance Company, 314 U.S. 118, 135, 62 S.Ct. 139, 144, 86 L.Ed. 100 (1941). There Mr. Justice Frankfurter wrote:
“ * * * a line of cases beginning with Hagan v. Lucas, 10 Pet. 400, 9 L.Ed. 470, holds that the court, whether federal or state, which first takes possession of a res withdraws the property from the reach of the other. * * * ‘The rank and authority of the (federal and state) courts are equal, but both courts cannot possess or control the same thing at the same time, and any attempt to do so would result in unseemly conflict’.”
See also, Princess Lida of Thurn and Taxis v. Thompson, 305 U.S. 456, 466, 59 S.Ct. 275, 83 L.Ed. 285 (1939), wherein the court stated:
“We have said that the principle applicable to both federal and state courts that the court first assuming jurisdiction over property may maintain and exercise that jurisdiction to the exclusion of the other, is not restricted to cases where property has been actually seized under judicial process before a second suit is instituted, but applies as well where suits are brought to marshal assets, administer trusts, or liquidate estates, and in suits of a similar nature where, to give effect to its jurisdiction, the court must control the property. The doctrine is necessary to the harmonious cooperation of federal and state tribunals.”
These principles, as expressed by the Supreme Court in Toucey and Princess Lida are sometimes said to apply to actions in rem only and not to actions in personam. Significantly, FSLIC relies on this same distinction in urging that this action not be dismissed. But this distinction does not preclude dismissal. As very recently expressed by Judge Pell, of our Court of Appeals, in Aetna State Bank v. Altheimer, 430 F.2d 750 (1970).
“The growth of the abstention doctrine is recognized in 1 Barron & HoltzoffWright, Federal Practice and Procedure § 64, 352 (1960). The doctrine is referred to by the authors as a sound development in the administration of the federal courts.
*1062The granting or denial of a stay has been held to be within the discretion of the trial court in analogous situations. Ferguson v. Tabah, 288 F.2d 665, 672 (2d Cir. 1961). The cases differentiate in rem and in personam actions in applying the principles here involved. More clearly, of course, the result of abstention was reached in the in rem cases where a state court already had custody of a res. A federal court must decline jurisdiction, in accord with the settled rule that the court first taking jurisdiction of a res may proceed to final judgment. Ã¢ÂÂ¢ 1 Barron & Holtzoff-Wright, Federal Practice & Procedure § 64, 351 (1960). While it seems to be well established that a federal court is not required to abate the normal in personam action on a plea of a pending action in a state court, nevertheless it is within the discretionary power of the district court to stay its proceedings pending the completion of state proceedings. See Ballantine Books, Inc. v. Capital Distributing Co., 302 F.2d 17, 19 (2nd Cir. 1962). See also, Seaboard Finance Co. v. Davis, 276 F.Supp. 507, 511 (N.D.Ill.1967).” (pp. 755-756)
In other words, in an action in rem, abstention is often required, whereas in actions in personam there is more room for the exercise of judicial discretion. I find that sound discretion here calls for dismissal. As stated in American Fidelity & Casualty Company v. Service Oil Company, 164 F.2d 478, 480-481 (4th Cir. 1947):
“There could be no possible justification for dragging into the federal court the litigation of the issues pending in the state court. * * * Even though the court has jurisdiction to grant the * * * relief, it should not exercise the jurisdiction ‘to try a controversy by piecemeal, or to try particular issues without settling the entire controversy, or to interfere with an action which has already been instituted.’
Ordinarily, the court first acquiring jurisdiction of a controversy should be allowed to proceed with it without interference from other courts under suits subsequently instituted.”
See also, Brillhart v. Excess Insurance Company, 316 U.S. 491, 62 S.Ct. 1173, 86 L.Ed. 1620 (1942); and Reiter v. Illinois Nat. Cas. Co., 213 F.2d 946 (7th Cir. 1954).
Despite these many considerations of comity, FSLIC, relying only on its predetermined opinion that this court has jurisdiction, imperiously demands that jurisdiction be exercised. As I have stated above, even were jurisdiction present, the controversy between this court and Judge O’Brien’s court such as counsel would engender, is unthinkable, practicing as we do in this same community and often concurrently dealing with the same subject matter.
Finally, I believe sound judicial administration also dictates dismissal of this cause. After spending many hours in extensive conferences and many other hours in preparation for these conferences and having finally reached a partial settlement of certain claims, I was advised that the state court would have to consider de novo the merits of any settlement I approved. In complex cases such as this, pretrial settlement negotiations are often more difficult than complete trial of less complex cases. Here, if I were to retain jurisdiction, two courts would labor with many of the same issues in the same case. This possibility is absurd. I have in the past weighed similar considerations in declaring or accepting jurisdiction. For example, in Johns-Manville Sales Corp. v. Chicago Title and Trust, 261 F.Supp. 905 (D.C.1966), I entertained, on the theory of ancillary jurisdiction, the claim of a co-plaintiff growing out of the same facts as the case in chief, but which sought less than the jurisdictional amount. There I stated (p. 908):
“Basically law is common sense. Paraphrasing the late Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court, Edward Douglass White, whenever a rule of law does not make common sense *1063it should not be followed. It is unthinkable under our present advanced state of judicial administration to require the same case be tried separately in two different courts. Duplicitous expenses and an unjustifiable imposition on an already overtaxed judicial system run contrary to recent advancements in legal rules of procedure —most notably our own model Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.”
Later, in Fugard v. Thierry and Layden v. Zantop, 265 F.Supp. 743, 750 (D.C.1967), I remanded certain cases to the state court where separate but related cases were pending.
“In reaching this decision I am fully aware that there is as yet no precedent for the application of the Finn [American Fire and Casualty Co. v. Finn, 341 U.S. 6, 71 S.Ct. 534, 95 L.Ed. 702] doctrine to circumstances involving plaintiffs who have initiated separate though related lawsuits in the state court.
I am equally aware of the practical considerations which give support to my decision. If I denied the motion to remand and retained jurisdiction, two courts of competent jurisiction within the same city would entertain basically the same lawsuit, that is, involving substantially the same factual and legal issues, the same attorneys, and the same parties. Costly and duplicitous pretrial preparation would also be necessary. Considering the well known and much publicized backlog of cases and the shortage of manpower on the bench and in the litigation practice field, it would be asinine to facilitate such a possibility.”
Significantly, in the Aetna State Bank case, supra, Judge Pell judicially accepted similar considerations as proper in determining whether a district court should abstain in deference to state courts. Displaying the practical wisdom that has already marked his career on our Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, the learned judge observed:
“The power to stay proceedings is incidental to the power inherent in every court to control the disposition of the causes on its docket with economy of time and effort for itself, for counsel and for litigants. How this can best be done calls for the exercise of judgment, which must weigh competing interests and maintain an even balance. Landis v. North American Co., 299 U.S. 248, 254, 57 S.Ct. 163, 81 L.Ed. 153 (1936). A stay pending the outcome of the litigation in another court between the same parties, involving the same or controlling issues is an acceptable means of avoiding unnecessary duplication of judicial machinery. ACF Industries, Inc. v. Guinn, 384 F.2d 15, 19 (5th Cir. 1967).” (430 F.2d p. 755).
For the many compelling reasons expressed herein, I can conclude only that this cause, FSLIC v. Kelly, should be dismissed without prejudice to plaintiff’s right to bring the same claims in the state court where its receivership is pending. An order shall enter accordingly.
A further order shall also be entered today dismissing the case of Katin v. Apollo for the reasons urged by FSLIC, particularly, that the plaintiffs’ claims should be presented in the court wherein the receivership is pending. As stated in a separate memorandum relating to the Katin case, this dismissal is likewise without prejudice.
MEMORANDUM AND ORDER IN NO. 68 C 808.
Plaintiffs are owners or holders of withdrawable capital accounts of Apollo Savings (“Apollo”). These shareholder-depositors bring this action against Apollo and its directors and allege, inter alia, certain violations of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as well as other allegations of fraud and mismanagement. The primary relief sought is an award of dividends on their withdrawable capital accounts for the period November 1, 1967 (when the last dividend was paid) *1064until the date each depositor received the principal of his account from the insurer, Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation. (“FSLIC”). Plaintiffs also seek an award to certain shareholders of the amounts of withdrawable capital accounts in excess of the insured amount, $15,000. One named plaintiff was the owner or holder of an account in excess of $15,000. All other named plaintiffs have recovered the full amount of their principal from the insurer.
Upon review of the issues here presented I am convinced by the arguments of the state court receiver, FSLIC, that the claims here presented for “dividends” or “interest” are not properly cognizable in this court, but may be presented in the state court where the receivership is pending and where FSLIC is acting as receiver under the supervision of the state court. See, Federal Savings & Loan Insurance Corporation v. Huttner, 401 F.2d 58 (7th Cir. 1968); Mutual Shares Corp. v. Genesco, Inc., 384 F.2d 540 (2nd Cir. 1967).
The claims for the uninsured portion of an account, (the amount in excess of $15,000) may present a claim cognizable in this court. Tcherepnin v. Knight, 389 U.S. 332, 88 S.Ct. 548, 19 L.Ed.2d 564 (1967). I agree with the arguments of FSLIC and the other defendants, however, that the present complaint does not adequately allege certain elements, most notably reliance, necessary to state a cause of action under the securities acts.
More importantly, it appears clear at this time that all claims for principal accounts in excess of the insured amount of $15,000 will be paid. These claims are apparently pending in the receivership action in the state court. In view of this fact it seems pointless to go through trial of difficult issues relating to fraud, reliance and the possible application of the statute of limitations, when payment will be forthcoming in a more painless manner in the state court receivership proceedings. If payment of these accounts is not received in a reasonable time, or if it appears said payments will not be made, plaintiffs have leave to reinstate this cause.
In all other respects this cause is dismissed without prejudice to the rights of all plaintiffs to present these same claims in the state court.

. The Katin plaintiffs also seek recovery for the uninsured portions of accounts exceeding $15,000 at the time Apollo was closed.

  MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER
 

  JEFFREY COLE, United States Magistrate Judge.
 

  Following remand of this case to the Commissioner, Ms. Grieves sought $5,889.38 in attorneys’ fees and costs under the Equal Access to Justice Act (“EAJA”). EAJA authorizes the payment of attorneys’ fees to a prevailing party in an action against the United States absent a showing by the government that its position in the underlying litigation “was substantially justified.” 28 U.S.C. § 2412(d)(1)(A);
  
   Scarborough v. Principi,
  
  541 U.S. 401, 124 S.Ct. 1856, 158 L.Ed.2d 674 (2004). It is Ms. Grieves’ contention that the Commissioner’s denial of her application for Disability Insurance Benefits (“DIB”) and Supplemental Security Income (“SSI”) was not substantially justified.
 

  In brief, the facts are these: Ms. Grieves applied for DIB and SSI on October 4, 2005, alleging that she had been unable to work since August 25, 2005 due to degenerative disc disease. (Administrative Record (“R.”) at 77, 102). She also claimed to suffer from depression and anxiety. (R. 51). Her application was denied at the initial and reconsideration levels of administrative review, and Ms. Grieves requested a hearing before an administrative law judge (“ALJ”). (R. 39-M2, 45-48, 55). The ALJ conducted the hearing on January 18, 2007, at which Ms. Grieves, represented by counsel, testified. (R. 553-577). Edward Pagella testified as a vocational expert. (R 571-575). In an opinion dated February 2, 2007, the ALJ found that although Ms. Grieves was not able to perform her past work as a secretary (R. 24), she was not disabled because she could perform other jobs such as assembler, hand packager, or hand sorter (R. 24-25). This became the final decision of the Commissioner when the Appeals Council denied Ms. Grieves’ request for review of the decision on June 8, 2007. (R. 4-6).
  
   See
  
  20 C.F.R. §§ 416.1455; 416.1481. Ms. Grieves appealed the decision to the federal district court under 42 U.S.C. § 405(g), and the parties consented to the jurisdiction of the magistrate judge pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(c).
  
   1
  


  On July 11, 2008, I issued a decision remanding this case to the Commissioner for further proceedings.
  
   Grieves v. Astrue,
  
  2008 WL 2755069 (N.D.Ill.2008). I found that the ALJ failed to make an adequate determination as to Ms. Grieves’ credibility. He considered only her daily activities and her failure to seek additional
   
   *998
   
  medical treatment for her pain. While the ALJ called Ms. Grieves’ lifestyle “relatively active,” it was in fact limited, with Ms. Grieves helping her teenage children get off to school, occasionally accompanying her husband shopping, watching television off and on all day, periodically reading, playing cards in ten-fifteen minute increments, and independently caring for herself, except for her inability to take a tub bath. Moreover, she could only perform these limited activities sporadically with frequent breaks.
  
   Grieves,
  
  2008 WL 2755069 at *14. For example, she could only play a game for about fifteen minutes or concentrate on a book for a single chapter. And, the ALJ ignored Ms. Grieves’ other testimony that she was unable to sweep, vacuum, sew, garden, or drive.
 

  I determined that the ALJ improperly relied upon Ms. Grieves’ limited daily activities as evidence she could perform a full-time job—a conclusion the Seventh Circuit has refused to endorse.
  
   See e.g., Gentle v. Barnhart,
  
  430 F.3d 865, 867 (7th Cir.2005)(“The administrative law judge’s casual equating of household work to work in the labor market cannot stand. Gentle
  
   must
  
  take care of her children, or else abandon them to foster care or perhaps her sister, and the choice may impel her to heroic efforts. A person can be totally disabled for purposes of entitlement to social security benefits even if, because of an indulgent employer or circumstances of desperation, he is in fact working.”)(Emphasis in original);
  
   Carradine v. Barnhart,
  
  360 F.3d 751, 755 (7th Cir.2004);
  
   Clifford v. Apfel,
  
  227 F.3d 863, 872 (7th Cir.2000).
  
   See Grieves,
  
  2008 WL 2755069 at *15.
 

  I also concluded that the ALJ ought to have considered Ms. Grieves’ other testimony as well, or to have explained why he rejected it.
  
   See, e.g., Lopez ex rel. Lopez v. Barnhart,
  
  336 F.3d 535, 539 (7th Cir.2003);
  
   Zurawski v. Halter,
  
  245 F.3d 881, 888 (7th Cir.2001) The ALJ also failed to discuss what effect Ms. Grieves’ pain medications—including some strong narcotics— had on her ability to sustain activities over prolonged periods of time. Instead—and this too was contrary to settled precedent—the ALJ simply mentioned them without any explanation of how they played into his final conclusion or, more accurately, why they did not. This omission was all the more significant since multiple doctors commented on how the medications impaired her functioning. Simply noting that Ms. Grieves was on medication is, in and of itself, meaningless.
  
   See Scheck v. Barnhart,
  
  357 F.3d 697, 703 (7th Cir.2004);
  
   Zurawski,
  
  245 F.3d at 888. And it was a
  
   non-sequitur
  
  for the ALJ to have concluded that Ms. Grieves’ claim of
  
   present
  
  inability to do laundry was inconsistent with her testimony that she
  
   used to
  
  do laundry, but no longer could because she had injured herself while performing that task.
 

  I also concluded that the ALJ inappropriately discounted the opinion of Ms. Grieves’ treating physician because it was not supported by the evidence. In so doing, the ALJ discussed only those portions of the record that bolstered his finding, while ignoring those that did not. This was contrary to the requirement that an ALJ must minimally articulate his reasons for discounting a treating physician’s opinion,
  
   see Elder v. Astrue,
  
  529 F.3d 408, 415 (7th Cir.2008);
  
   Schmidt v. Astrue,
  
  496 F.3d 833, 842 (7th Cir.2007) and cannot “ignore an entire line of evidence contrary to [his] findings.”
  
   Zurawski,
  
  245 F.3d at 888.
  
   See also Clifford,
  
  227 F.3d at 874.
 

  But the record was anything but one-sided, and the case was not one “in which the Commissioner’s position is based on speculation with no support in the record.”
  
   Cunningham v. Barnhart,
  
  440 F.3d 862, 865 (7th Cir.2006). Indeed, the opinion
   
   *999
   
  concluded with a recognition of the closeness of the case:
 

  This is a close case. Part of the ALJ’s assessment was clearly right and it may well be that his assessment of Ms. Grieves’ credibility was insightful. There are things in the record that bear upon that credibility and that had they been critically and accurately assessed-some apparently did not even play into the ALJ’s evaluation-the result of this case might have been different. But just as it is not for the government to supply supportive reasons that the ALJ may not have considered, neither is it for a reviewing court to do so. These are all matters for the ALJ’s informed consideration on remand. The Commissioner’s motion to affirm the decision is denied. This case is remanded to the Commissioner for further proceedings consistent with this decision.
 


   Grieves,
  
  2008 WL 2755069 at *24.
 

  The government has objected to Ms. Grieves’ request for attorney’s fees and costs under EAJA. The purpose of EAJA is to eliminate the financial disincentive for people to challenge unreasonable governmental actions.
  
   See Sullivan v. Hudson,
  
  490 U.S. 877, 883-84, 109 S.Ct. 2248, 104 L.Ed.2d 941 (1989). The Act provides that a district court may award attorneys’ fees where: (1) the plaintiff is a “prevailing party”; (2) the government’s position was not substantially justified; (3) no “special circumstances make an award unjust”; and (4) the fee application is submitted to the court within 30 days of final judgment and is supported by an itemized statement. 28 U.S.C. § 2412(d)(1)(A), (B);
  
   Golembiewski v. Barnhart,
  
  382 F.3d 721, 723-24 (7th Cir.2004). Costs are available under 28 U.S.C. § 2412(a)(1).
 

  By virtue of the remand, Ms. Grieves is the prevailing party.
  
   Shalala v. Schaefer,
  
  509 U.S. 292, 302, 113 S.Ct. 2625, 125 L.Ed.2d 239 (1993). There are no “special circumstances” alleged.
  
   See Golembiewski,
  
  382 F.3d at 724;
  
   United States v. Hallmark Const. Co.,
  
  200 F.3d 1076, 1079 (7th Cir.2000). The plaintiffs application was timely filed and is supported by an itemized statement. Thus, the issue is whether the Commissioner’s position was substantially justified, a point on which the Commissioner bears the burden of proof.
  
   Golembiewski,
  
  382 F.3d at 724.
 

  “Substantially justified” is one of the myriad phrases in the law that has no precise or fixed definition. The Supreme Court has said that it means “justified in substance or in the main.”
  
   Pierce v. Underwood,
  
  487 U.S. 552, 565, 108 S.Ct. 2541, 101 L.Ed.2d 490 (1988). A position that is “substantially justified” must have a “reasonable basis both in law and in fact.”
  
   Id.
  
  It must be “justified in substance or in the main”-that is, justified to a degree that could satisfy a reasonable person.
  
   Id. Accord Golembiewski,
  
  382 F.3d at 724 (a position is substantially justified if a “reasonable person could believe the position was correct.”). EAJA decisions necessarily involve exercises of discretion,
  
   Pierce,
  
  487 U.S. at 561, 108 S.Ct. 2541;
  
   Cunningham,
  
  440 F.3d at 864, because of the “ ‘the sheer impracticability of formulating a rule of decision [in such cases]....’” Questions that arise under the Act, like many that arise in litigation generally, “ ‘are not amenable to regulation by rule because they involve multifarious, fleeting, special, narrow facts that utterly resist generalization-at least, for the time being.’ ”
  
   Pierce,
  
  487 U.S. at 552, 108 S.Ct. 2541. Being discretionary, fee awards under EAJA are reviewable under an abuse of discretion standard.
  
   Id. Compare United States v. Bullion,
  
  466 F.3d 574, 577 (7th Cir.2006) (“The striking of a balance of uncertainties can rarely be deemed unreasonable.... ”).
 

 
   *1000
   
  It is also essential to recall that “a position can be justified even though it is not correct,”
  
   Pierce,
  
  487 U.S. at 566, n. 2, 108 S.Ct. 2541, and “[the government] could take a position that is substantially justified, yet lose [on the merits].”
  
   Id.
  
  at 569, 108 S.Ct. 2541. Analysis of questions of substantial justification must take into account the government’s position in the underlying action and the litigation posture it took while defending the validity of that action in court. 28 U.S.C. § 2412(d)(2)(D);
  
   Cunningham,
  
  440 F.3d at 863-864. But, substantial justification should not be confused with the “substantial evidence” standard that applies to a court’s initial review of the case. Indeed, the Supreme Court has cautioned that consideration of a fee petition “ ‘should not result in a second major litigation.’ ”
  
   Pierce,
  
  487 U.S. at 563, 108 S.Ct. 2541.
  
   Accord Sosebee v. Astrue,
  
  494 F.3d 583, 588 (7th Cir.2007);
  
   Hallmark Const. Co.,
  
  200 F.3d at 1080. Thus, an EAJA petition requires the court to revisit the legal and factual circumstances of this case from a different perspective—the elusive standard of substantial justification—than it did in reviewing the record on the initial go-round to determine whether there was substantial evidence to support the conclusion.
  
   See Hallmark Const.,
  
  200 F.3d at
  
   1080.
  


  While EAJA petitions cannot be resolved by resort to a formula, the Seventh Circuit has offered some concrete guidance. It has said that a significant factor in determining whether the government’s position was substantially justified is the language of the district court’s opinion.
  
   Hallmark Const. Co.,
  
  200 F.3d at 1079. Just as strong language against the Commissioner’s position in an opinion is evidence that a position was not substantially justified,
  
   Golembiewski
  
  382 F.3d at 724, a court decision suggesting a close case supports the denial of fees.
  
   Cummings v. Sullivan,
  
  950 F.2d 492, 498 (7th Cir.1991) (“the closeness of the question is, in itself, evidence of substantial justification.”). As already noted, the opinion remanding the case concluded that this was “a close case.” Had the ALJ discussed certain things in the record that weighed against Ms. Grieves’ credibility, “the result ... might have been different.” This is certainly a strong indication that the Commissioner’s position was substantially justified.
 

  Ms. Grieves counters that there is language in the opinion indicating that the case was not close. She points to the comment that this was a “ ‘rare case’ where the ALJ’s credibility determination lacked any appropriate legal analysis and evidential support.”
  
   (Plaintiff’s Reply,
  
  at 6). This is not an accurate reading of the opinion, which merely stated that “this is one of those rare cases in which a credibility determination can be disturbed by a reviewing court, since the ALJ grounded his credibility finding in an observation or argument that is unreasonable or unsupported.”
  
   Grieves,
  
  2008 WL 2755069 at *16;
  
   Memorandum Opinion and Order,
  
  at 31. In any event, an errant credibility determination—as opposed to a total failure by the ALJ to make any credibility judgment—need not result in an award of attorneys’ fees, as the Seventh Circuit made clear in
  
   Cunningham. See
  
  440 F.3d at 864-65.
 

  Moreover, the opinion made clear that merely because the ALJ’s credibility analysis was flawed did not mean that his ultimate conclusion was. For example, the opinion pointed out that there was evidence that supported the ALJ’s conclusion that her statements to Dr. Franklin were not completely honest,
  
   Grieves,
  
  2008 WL 2755069 at *18, and that Ms. Grieves’ denial of alcohol use at the hearing was false.
  
   Id.
  
  at *8. Finally the opinion stressed that the case was close, that part of the ALJ’s assessment was clearly right, and that it may well be that his assessment of Ms.
   
   *1001
   
  Grieves’ credibility was insightful.
  
   See id.
  
  at *24;
  
   supra
  
  at 998-99.
 

  But the language of an opinion is just one indicator of the strength of the case. One must also look to the overall rationale for remanding this case to the Commissioner. In the main, this case turned on the ALJ’s failure adequately to articulate his analysis—or, as the court said in
  
   Cunningham,
  
  on his “failfure] to connect all the dots in his analysis.” 440 F.3d at 865. Seventeen years ago, the Seventh Circuit called the requirement that an ALJ adequately articulate his consideration of the evidence “deliberately flexible.”
  
   Stein v. Sullivan,
  
  966 F.2d 317, 319 (7th Cir.1992). Therefore, the court held that because there was evidence to support the ALJ’s decision, despite the fact that he failed to consider or discuss contrary evidence, the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying fees.
 

  In the intervening years, the “logical bridge” requirement has become one of the court’s consistent themes and has occasioned not a few reversals even where the district judge found the ALJ’s reasoning adequately articulated to allow meaningful review.
  
   See, e.g., Craft v. Astrue,
  
  539 F.3d 668, 677-78 (7th Cir.2008);
  
   Getch v. Astrue,
  
  539 F.3d 473, 481-82 (7th Cir.2008);
  
   Giles ex rel. Giles v. Astrue,
  
  483 F.3d 483, 487 (7th Cir.2007);
  
   Murphy v. Astrue,
  
  496 F.3d 630, 634 (7th Cir.2007);
  
   Ribaudo v. Barnhart,
  
  458 F.3d 580, 584 (7th Cir.2006);
  
   Young v. Barnhart,
  
  362 F.3d 995, 1002 (7th Cir.2004);
  
   Golembiewski v. Barnhart,
  
  322 F.3d 912, 914-915 (7th Cir.2003). The Seventh Circuit’s reversals has not gone unnoticed at the district court level, and some judges have found that the Commissioner’s position was not substantially justified where the ALJ failed to build a “logical bridge.”
  
   See Bailey v. Barnhart,
  
  473 F.Supp.2d 842, 850-51 (N.D.Ill.2006)(discussing failure to build “logical bridge” as one reason among several why the government’s position was not substantially justified);
  
   Herron v. Barnhart,
  
  2004 WL 1397547, *3 (N.D.Ill.2004);
  
   Henderson v. Barnhart,
  
  2004 WL 868396, *3 (N.D.Ill.2004). But it would be incorrect to conclude that an ALJ’s violation of the “logical bridge” requirement necessitated granting an EAJA petition.
 

  More recently, the Seventh Circuit interpreted
  
   Stein
  
  as holding that an ALJ’s failure to meet the articulation requirement did not mandate a finding that the Commissioner’s position was not substantially justified, but cautioned that there was no
  
   per se
  
  rule
  
   precluding
  
  attorneys’ fees whenever the alleged error is the failure to articulate.
  
   Conrad v. Barnhart,
  
  434 F.3d 987, 991 (7th Cir.2006). In the last analysis, like so much in law, it is all a question of degree.
  
   2
  
  In order for fees to be awarded where the remand was bottomed on the failure to build a “logical bridge” from the facts of the conclusion, the deficiency would have to be far more pervasive than it was in this case.
 

  In
  
   Cunningham v. Barnhart, supra,
  
  the ALJ discussed the claimant’s credibility, but failed to adequately support his determination with reference to the medical evidence that he thought undermined the claimant’s complaints. He also failed to discuss certain evidence, such as treatments and medications, that might have supported the claimant’s complaints. 440 F.3d at 863-64. In so doing, the ALJ
   
   *1002
   
  failed to follow case law directing him to consider certain factors in assessing credibility, address evidence that ran contrary to his conclusion, and adequately articulate his reasoning.
  
   Id.
  
  at 863-65.
 

  Nevertheless, the district court found the government’s position substantially justified, and the Seventh Circuit affirmed.
  
   3
  
  Although the ALJ “was not as thorough in his analysis as he could have been,” 440 F.3d at 865, the Seventh Circuit concluded that fees were not required since it was “not a case in which the Commissioner’s position [was] based on speculation with no support in the record.”
  
   Id.
  
  at 865. The Seventh Circuit, therefore, had “no trouble concluding the Commissioner’s position was substantially justified.” The lack of thoroughness and a failure to adhere to essentially the same case law as was of concern in
  
   Cunningham
  
  are also the faults in the ALJ’s decision here. There is no feature of this case that requires a different result from that in
  
   Cunningham.
  


  Contrast that—as the court did in
  
   Cunningham,
  
  440 F.3d at 865—with the situation in
  
   Golembiewski.
  
  There, the ALJ engaged in
  
   no
  
  credibility discussion; one could only speculate as to why the ALJ rejected the claimant’s testimony.
  
   Golembiewski,
  
  382 F.3d at 724. The Commissioner argued that the ALJ’s credibility finding could be implied. However, as
  
   Cunningham
  
  noted in contrasting
  
   Golembiewski,
  
  the argument “was blatantly contrary to the Commissioner’s own previous ruling.”
  
   Cunningham,
  
  440 F.3d at 864. Moreover, the ALJ in
  
   Golembiewski
  
  ignored evidence substantiating the claimant’s main impairment: a herniated disc. So deficient in reasoning and analysis was the ALJ’s decision, that the Seventh Circuit urged the Commissioner in
  
   Golembiewski
  
  to assign the matter to a different ALJ on remand. 382 F.3d at 725. In short, the government’s position was so plainly unjustified that an award of fees was clearly a proper exercise of discretion.
 

  This case falls much closer to
  
   Cunningham
  
  than it does to
  
   Golembiewski.
  
  As in
  
   Cunningham,
  
  the ALJ here did not
  
   fail
  
  “to engage in any credibility determination ... rather, [he] failed to connect all the dots in his analysis.” 440 F.3d at 865. Although he might have neglected to discuss certain physician’s findings as to the severity of Ms. Grieves’ impairments, he did not ignore evidence establishing her medical condition.
 

  Ms. Grieves thinks the case is closer to
  
   Boyd v. Barnhart,
  
  175 Fed.Appx. 47 (7th Cir.2006). The citation of
  
   Boyd
  
  warrants a brief discussion. The opinion contains the legend that it is “Not for Publication in West’s Federal Reporter” and refers to Rule 32.1, Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure and Circuit Rule 32.1. Both Rules 32.1 provide that a court cannot prohibit or restrict the citation of federal judicial opinions, orders, judgments, or other written dispositions that have been designated as “unpublished,” “not for publication,” “nonprecedential,” or the like and issued on or after January 1, 2007. Circuit Rule 32.1 prohibits the citation of non-precedential orders issued before January 1, 2007. While I need not decide whether the Rule applies to briefing in the district court or only in the Court of Appeals,
  
   4
  
  two things
   
   *1003
   
  are clear. First, such opinions do not have precedential force, Circuit Rule 32.1(b);
  
   Duthie v. Matria Healthcare, Inc.,
  
  254 F.R.D. 90, 96 (N.D.Ill.2008);
  
   Lau v. Arrow Financial Services, LLC,
  
  245 F.R.D. 620, 626 (N.D.Ill.2007), and second, the case is not helpful to Ms. Grieves.
 

  The Seventh Circuit found EAJA fees warranted in
  
   Boyd,
  
  but as in
  
   Golembiewski,
  
  the ALJ provided absolutely no discussion of his credibility finding:
 

  In his written decision, the ALJ made no explicit determination of whether Boyd’s testimony regarding his pain was credible. Instead the ALJ noted generally that “[w]hile claimant may have some degree of pain and limitation it is not as severe or limiting as claimant has alleged.”
 

  175 Fed.Appx. at 48. And, as in
  
   Golembiewski,
  
  the Commissioner argued that the ALJ’s credibility determination could be implied from the record—a manifestly unreasonable argument for the Commissioner to have made. 175 Fed.Appx. at 50. So
  
   Boyd,
  
  like
  
   Golembiewski,
  
  falls toward the other end of the spectrum from cases like
  
   Cunningham
  
  and the instant case.
 

  In the end, the instant case is one where “[tjhere was evidence to support the [Commissioner’s] position; a genuine dispute existed.”
  
   Stein,
  
  966 F.2d at 320. It is the type of case where courts have found that the government’s position was substantially justified,
  
   see Conrad v. Barnhart,
  
  434 F.3d 987, 991 (7th Cir.2006)(position substantially justified although ALJ failed to refer to doctor’s findings as to vocational restrictions);
  
   Mogg v. Astrue,
  
  266 Fed.Appx. 470, 471-472 (7th Cir.2008)(position substantially justified despite fact that court could not trace the path of ALJ’s reasoning and ALJ rejected evidence contrary to his conclusion without adequate explanation), and I find it was here as well.
 

  CONCLUSION
 

  What is clear from the cases is that there is no algorithmic solution under EAJA to the necessarily variant factual circumstances each case presents, and which ultimately guide the district court’s discretionary decision of whether to allow attorneys’ fees and costs. And being discretionary, there is bound to be some inconsistency in decisions,
  
   cf. Johnson v. Daley,
  
  339 F.3d 582, 593-94 (7th Cir.2003), for two decision makers can arrive at opposite conclusions without either being an abuse of discretion.
  
   Cf. United States v. Banks,
  
  546 F.3d 507, 508 (7th Cir.2008). Were it otherwise, district courts would be bound by a fixed rule requiring an award of fees rather than discretionary choice. For the foregoing reasons, the plaintiffs request for fees and costs under EAJA is DENIED.

  OPINION
 

  NYE, Chief Justice.
 

  Appellant was charged with the offense of inducing sexual performance of a child by taking suggestive sexual pictures of a child. Texas Penal Code Ann. § 43.25(b) (Vernon Supp.1987). A prior felony offense of forgery was alleged in the indictment for enhancement purposes. The jury found appellant guilty, and the court assessed punishment at thirty years confinement. Appellant alleges error in the admission of prior convictions, certain exhibits and testimony of the child prosecutrix.
 

  The record reflects that one August morning, the Sheriff’s Department of San Patricio County received an anonymous phone call from a woman who claimed that two children were locked outside of their home and left unattended. Approximately fifteen minutes later, a deputy sheriff, Don Barr, arrived at the residence, a trailer house, and found two young girls outside covered in mud. Upon questioning the girls, he learned that they were sisters and that the oldest one was eight years old. The eight year old told him they needed to get into the house because their three month old baby brother was locked inside. She said her mother was at work in Corpus Christi, but she did not know where her mother worked. She also did not know where her stepfather was. After Officer
   
   *803
   
  Barr found the front and back doors locked, he asked the eight year old if there was another way to get in. She said a window was unlocked and that it was okay for him to go in the house through this window. Officer Barr entered the trailer house through the window and let the children in. Then the eight year old led Officer Barr to a bedroom to check on the infant. The infant was lying in a bassinet, wearing only a soiled diaper. He was crying and had mosquito bites all over his body. In response to a radio request by Officer Barr, he was told that a woman with the Department of Human Resources, Julie Durham, was en route to the trailer home. While the officer waited for Ms. Durham, he continued to watch over the children and to attempt to find out more information from them concerning the whereabouts of their parents.
 

  When Durham arrived, Officer Barr showed her the baby. Ms. Durham cleaned the baby and tried to quiet him down. Then Ms. Durham made some phone calls to try to locate a proper person to take custody of the children. The eight year old helped Officer Barr find some clean clothes for the infant. She also told him there was some medicine they had been putting on the infant for the bug bites. The eight year old led him to a bedside table and showed him the medicine. Officer Barr testified that on the same bedside table he saw photographs (identified as exhibits 1, 2, & 3) of the eight year old girl in sexually suggestive poses exposing her genitalia. He picked up the pictures and took possession of them. He also saw a .357 magnum pistol. Officer Barr picked up the gun, unloaded it, and put it in a safer place.
 

  By point of error number one, appellant contends that the trial court erroneously permitted the prosecutor to cross-examine him concerning two prior convictions during the guilt stage of the trial.
 

  During cross-examination, the prosecutor told the court he was about to bring up two prior felony convictions of appellant. Appellant’s attorney objected, “Judge, I of course would object to it. These two convictions, my understanding, are for enhancement purposes.” After the judge was satisfied that both the convictions were final prior to this incident, he overruled the objection. No other objections were made. The prosecutor then asked appellant if he was the same John Winslow who was convicted of the offense of burglary with intent to commit theft and the offense of forgery. The witness answered that he was.
 

  Appellant asserts here that the pri- or convictions were not admissible during the guilt stage of the trial because one of the offenses was alleged in the indictment for enhancement purposes. Appellant relies on Tex.Code Crim.Proe.Ann. art. 36.01 (Vernon 1974), which provides: “When pri- or convictions are alleged for purposes of enhancement only and are not jurisdictional, that portion of the indictment or information reciting such convictions shall not be read until the hearing on punishment is held.” Article 36.01 does not preclude the State from impeaching an accused who testifies, by proof that he has previously been convicted.
  
   See Bell v. State,
  
  641 S.W.2d 377 (Tex.App.—Dallas 1982, pet. ref’d). The purpose of article 36.01 is to prevent prejudice which would result from an announcement at the outset of the proceedings that the State believes the defendant has been previously convicted.
  
   Frausto v. State,
  
  642 S.W.2d 506, 508 (Tex.Crim.App. 1982). At the beginning of the trial, when the indictment was read, the prosecutor did refrain from reading the prior conviction alleged in the indictment. The introduction of the prior convictions here complained of occurred during the cross-examination of the defendant. Cross-examination of the defendant is not the functional equivalent of reading the indictment to the jury at the introduction of the case; therefore, article 36.01 is not applicable.
 

  Appellant also asserts that the trial court should not have permitted the prior convictions because they were too remote in time. However, defendant’s only objection before the trial court was that the convictions were for enhancement purposes. Prior to trial, during a hearing outside the presence of the jury, the trial court asked the appel
   
   *804
   
  lant’s attorney if he needed a ruling on the motion in limine that he filed. Appellant’s counsel said, “The only thing — I'm sure he’s not going to do it, I want to make sure he doesn’t come up with this enhancement provision.” The prosecutor agreed, “that will not be read in the indictment.” The judge asked if they were “squared away on that” and each side indicated — they were. The motion in limine was not signed by the judge.
 

  The objection at trial merely stated that the convictions were for enhancement purposes. When an objection in the trial court differs from the complaint on appeal, a defendant has not preserved error for appeal.
  
   Burdine v. State,
  
  719 S.W.2d 309, 319 (Tex.Crim.App.1986),
  
   cert. denied,
  
  — U.S. -, 107 S.Ct. 1590, 94 L.Ed.2d 779 (1987). Appellant’s objection was insufficient to provide the trial judge and the prosecutor with notice that defendant was in fact complaining that the prior convictions were too remote. Appellant’s first point of error is overruled.
 

  Appellant’s second point of error complains that the photographs were seized without a search warrant in violation of the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article 1, section 9 of the Texas Constitution.
 

  The State contends that appellant failed to preserve the asserted error for review. During trial when the photographs were offered into evidence, appellant’s counsel renewed his pretrial objection by saying, “Defense has no objection other than the prior motion that has been filed.” At the pretrial hearing on the motion to suppress the photographs, appellant’s counsel attacked the admissibility of the photographs on the same grounds as those urged on appeal. The trial court denied the motion, finding that the warrantless entry was justified because the officer entered the residence in response to an emergency situation. The objection made at the hearing outside the jury’s presence was sufficient to preserve the asserted error for at least appellate review. Tex.R.App.Proc. 52(b);
  
   see Maynard v. State,
  
  685 S.W.2d 60, 65 (Tex.Crim.App.1985);
  
   Thomas v. State,
  
  723 S.W.2d 696 (Tex.Crim.App.1986).
 

  Appellant contends the photographs were inadmissible because they were seized without a warrant. However, it is now a well-established rule that the police may seize evidence in plain view and without a warrant if: (1) the officers are lawfully on the premises; (2) the discovery of the incriminating evidence is inadvertent; and, (3) it is immediately apparent that the incriminating evidence is seizable as evidence of a crime.
  
   Coolidge v. New Hampshire,
  
  403 U.S. 443, 91 S.Ct. 2022, 2037, 29 L.Ed.2d 564 (1971);
  
   White v. State,
  
  729 S.W.2d 737, 739 (Tex.Crim.App.1987). The officer must have probable cause to believe that the object seen in plain view is evidence of a crime.
  
   Arizona v. Hicks,
  
  — U.S. -, 107 S.Ct. 1149, 94 L.Ed.2d 347 (1987);
  
   White,
  
  729 S.W.2d 737.
 

  Appellant also contends that the deputy sheriff was not lawfully on the premises because no search warrant was processed, and that the evidence was not “inadvertently discovered.” We disagree.
 

  The Fourth Amendment does not preclude police officers from making war-rantless entries and searches when they have reason to believe that a person within is in need of immediate aid.
  
   Mincey v. Arizona,

   Bolden v. State,
  
  634 S.W.2d 710, 713 (Tex.Crim.App.1982). “The need to protect or preserve life or avoid serious injury is justification for what would be otherwise illegal absent an exigency or emergency.”
  
   Mincey,
  
  437 U.S. at 392, 98 S.Ct. at 2413. The burden of proof is on the State to demonstrate that the warrantless entry was justified by an emergency.
  
   Janicek,
  
  634 S.W.2d at 691. The reasonableness of the emergency entry is to be judged by the circumstances as they existed at the time the decision was made to enter rather than being affected by whatever condition is found inside.
  
   Janicek,
  
  634 S.W.2d at 691. In assessing an officer’s belief that a war-rantless entry was justified by an emergency, an objective standard of reasonableness
   
   *805
   
  is applied.
  
   Bray v. State,
  
  597 S.W.2d 763, 765 (Tex.Crim.App.1980).
 

  The record indicates that in response to the emergency call Officer Barr went to the residence. Upon arrival, he found the two young children who did not know where their parents were. The children were locked out of their home and one of them expressed concern for her three month old brother who was locked inside the residence and who also was unattended. Barr testified that out of concern for the welfare of the three month old child he entered the residence. Considering all the circumstances existing at that time, the officer was justified in believing that an emergency existed and that the three month old’s life was in danger. After reviewing all of the evidence, we find the forced entry was justified and that the deputy sheriff was lawfully on the premises. The evidence also established that during the course of the emergency activities, Barr “inadvertently discovered” the photographs. Appellant’s second point of error is overruled.
 

  By point of error number three, appellant complains that the trial court erred in admitting testimony of the eight year old over objection that she was not competent to testify.
 

  The competency of a witness to testify is addressed in Tex.R.Crim.Evid. 601. The rule provides that all persons are competent to testify except “children or other persons who, after being examined by the court, appear not to possess sufficient intellect to relate transactions with respect to which they are interrogated.” It is well settled that the determination of a witness’ competency rests within the sound discretion of the trial judge who observes the witness and notices the witness’ demeanor and apparent possession or lack of intellect.
  
   Clark v. State, 558
  
  S.W.2d 887, 890 (Tex.Crim.App.1977). To determine if there has been an abuse of discretion, we review the entire testimony of the challenged witness.
  
   Clark,
  
  558 S.W.2d at 890. Our review of the testimony given by the eight year old reveals that she was able to respond to general background questions and to specific questions concerning the events surrounding the incident. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing her to testify. Appellant's third point of error is overruled.
 

  The judgment of the trial court is AFFIRMED.

1114855,1114855,476957,Hales v. Snowden,"FANNIE HALES, Respondent, v. EARL F. SNOWDEN Et Al., Defendants; CURTIS C. COLYEAR Et Al., Appellants","

  KNIGHT, J.
 

  The defendants Curtis C. and Florence E. Colyear appealed from an order made after final judgment and,from the final judgment as amended and supplemented by said order.  The question presented for determination may be stated as follows: Where an appeal has been taken by two of four mortgagors of real property from a decree rendered in the foreclosure action wherein is included an allowance for attorneys’ fees and the decree is affirmed, may the trial court, subsequent to the filing therein of the
  
   remittitur,
  
  allow additional attorneys’ fees for services rendered in resisting the appeal and thereupon enter a supplemental judgment whereby the additional amount allowed is incorporated in and becomes part of the original decree. It is our conclusion that the question must be answered in the negative, and therefore that the “order and supplemental judgment” made herein by the trial court allowing such additional fees and supplementing the original judgment cannot be sustained.
 

  The proceedings leading up to the making of said order and supplemental judgment were these: The respondent, Fannie Hales, brought an action to foreclose three mortgages on real property given to secure the payment of promissory notes, the principal sums of which totaled $21,000. The notes and mortgages were executed by appellants and two codefendants, namely, Earl F. and Constance H. Snowden. The notes contained no provision for the payment of attorneys’ fees, but each mortgage provided that it was given for the purpose of securing, first, the payment of the indebtedness evidenced by the promissory note; ""Second: Payment of attorney’s fees, in a reasonable sum to be fixed by the Court and all costs and expenses in any action brought to foreclose this mortgage or any action or proceeding affecting the rights either of Mortgagor or Mortgagee in said real property, whether such action or proceeding progress to judgment or not; ...” Among the relief prayed for in the foreclosure complaint was that respondent have judgment and execution against the parties above named for any deficiency that might remain after applying all the proceeds of the sale of the premises properly applicable to the satisfaction
   
   *803
   
  of the judgment. The Snowdens defaulted, but appellants filed an answer wherein they interposed several special defenses, among them being that the mortgages sought to be foreclosed were purchase price mortgages and that therefore the mortgagee “was not entitled to a personal or deficiency judgment"" against them. The trial court decided that issue and all others raised by the answer against appellants, and a decree in the usual form was entered, awarding a money judgment against the four parties above named in the sum of $21,816.84, together with the sum of $795.22 attorneys’ fees and costs, and directing the sheriff to sell the property at foreclosure sale. The decree also directed the entry of a deficiency judgment against said parties in the event the proceeds of the sale were insufficient to satisfy the amounts due under the decree. The Colyears appealed to the Supreme Court, urging as one of the main grounds for reversal that the court erroneously directed the entry of a deficiency judgment. The appeal was transferred for hearing and determination to the District Court of Appeal and the decree was affirmed.
  
   (Hales
  
  v.
  
   Snowden,
  
  19 Cal. App. (2d) 366 [65 Pac. (2d) 847].) Subsequently a petition for hearing by the Supreme Court was denied; and appellants then petitioned the Supreme Court of the United States
  
   (Colyear
  
  v.
  
   Hales,
  
  302 U. S. 715 [58 Sup. Ct. 34, 82 L. Ed. 552]), for a writ of
  
   certiorari,
  
  which petition likewise was denied. Upon the filing of the
  
   remittitur
  
  issued by the District Court of Appeal respondent served notice, supported by affidavits, that she would present a motion to the trial court “for an order and supplemental judgment fixing and determining attorneys’ fees to be allowed to the plaintiff for the defense of the appeal. .. [taken] by defendants to the District Court of Appeal and Supreme Court of the state of California and to the Supreme Court of the United States ...’’. Appellants filed written objections to said motion, supported by counter affidavits, and after a hearing the trial court on November 12, 1937, granted the motion. The order made in this behalf was entitled “Order and Supplemental Judgment Fixing Attorneys’ Fees”. It contained findings to the effect that all of the facts set forth in the affidavits filed in support of the motion were true; that each of the mortgages mentioned in the complaint provided for the “payment of attorneys’ fees, in a reasonable sum to be fixed by the court and all costs and expenses in any action brought to foreclose this mortgage or any
   
   *804
   
  action or proceeding affecting the rights either of mortgagor or mortgagee in said real property”; and that plaintiff .was “entitled under the terms of said mortgage to a reasonable sum for attorneys’ fees for the defense against .the appeal of the said defendants to the District Court of Appeal and Supreme Court of the state of California and against the petition of said defendants for a writ of
  
   certiorari
  
  to the United States Supreme Court”, and that the reasonable value of said services was $1,000; whereupon it was “ordered, adjudged and decreed that the plaintiff, Fannie Hales, have judgment against the defendants for the sum of one thousand ($1000.00) dollars and that said sum be apportioned ’ ’ as specified therein against the three causes of action “and become a part of the amount due thereunder to the same force
  
   as
  
  [and] effect as though included in the original judgment ... ”, together with interest thereon from the date of the entry of said order.
 

  The parties are agreed that a provision in a mortgage relating to the allowance of attorneys’ fees constitutes the measure of the trial court’s authority to make such allowance, and in their briefs they have argued to some extent the disputed point as to whether the provision contained in each of the mortgages here was in any event broad enough in its terms to justify an allowance for services rendered on an appeal which might be taken from the decree of foreclosure. In this regard appellants cite authorities to the effect that such a provision must be strictly construed against the party foreclosing (Jones on Mortgages, 7th ed., vol. 3, p. 186, and 19
  
   R. C.
  
  L. 567, cited approvingly in
  
   Gralynn Laundry
  
  v.
  
   Virginia Bond
  
  &
  
   Mortgage Corp.,
  
  121 Fla. 312 [163 So. 706] ;
  
   Booker
  
  v.
  
   Booker,
  
  220 Ala. 367 [125 So. 212] ;
  
   Lampkin
  
  v.
  
   Irwin,
  
  202 Ala. 14 [79 So. 300]); and applying such rule of construction to the mortgage provisions here under consideration, they contend that the latter portion thereof upon which respondent seems to rely, reading, “ ... or any action or proceeding affecting the rights either of mortgagor or mortgagee in said real property, whether such action or proceeding progress to judgment or not”, referred to attacks made by third persons against the rights of the mortgagor or the mortgagee or both, in the mortgaged property; whereas respondent contends that said provision was intended to apply as well to any proceeding between the parties to the mortgage, growing out of the foreclosure action, such as an appeal from the decree entered therein.
 

 
   *805
   
  Irrespective, however, of the merits of either of the arguments so advanced, it is a well-settled legal doctrine that upon the rendition and entry of the decree of foreclosure the provisions of the mortgage become merged therein (18 Cal. Jur., p. 471), following which the terms of the decree govern the rights of the parties; and here admittedly the decree contains no provision which directly or by implication, by way of reservation or otherwise, would authorize the allowance of attorneys’ fees for any services rendered subsequent to the rendition and entry thereof. Therefore, since the decree for all purposes became final upon its affirmance on appeal, which was prior to the presentation of respondent’s motion, it was clearly beyond the power of the trial court thereafter to amend, modify or supplement the same by increasing the amount of money the mortgagors were called upon thereunder to pay. That such would be the plain effect of the “order and supplemental judgment” is beyond question, for in case either of a redemption of the property or satisfaction of the deficiency judgment, the additional allowance of attorneys’ fees would be added to and included in the amount the mortgagors would be required to pay.
 

  Respondent does not question the doctrine that once a decree has become final, it may not be amended, modified or supplemented, except, of course, where otherwise authorized by statute or in some cases to correct clerical error or misprision, due to inadvertence; but she points out that the cases cited in California Jurisprudence in support of the merger rule do not involve the matter of allowance of attorneys’ fees. It may be so conceded; nevertheless those cases declare the law to be as stated in California Jurisprudence that “The mortgage is merged in the judgment or decree rendered in the foreclosure suit, whether the property is sold under foreclosure in an action in which the mortgagee was plaintiff or one in which, as defendant, he prayed foreclosure under a cross-complaint.” Furthermore, respondent cites certain cases to show that the merger rule does not apply to a new cause of action accruing since the rendition of the decree, such, for example, as where the matter could not have been provided for in the original decree. But those cases are not in point here, because if the provisions of the mortgage so justified, reservation in the decree could have been made for the future allowance of fees in case of appeal.
 

 
   *806
   
  As supporting her position generally that it was within the power of the trial court, after the judgment had become final, to make additional allowance for attorneys’ fees, respondent cites

  there was no judgment, final or otherwise, before the trial court at the time application was made for additional attorneys’ fees. As shown by the facts set forth in the opinion therein, the judgment had been reversed. And

  did not involve a mortgage but was an action to foreclose a materialman’s lien. It was therefore governed by a special statute (sec. 1195, Code Civ.

   supreme courts
  
  ...” etc. (italics ours); and on a former appeal the judgment while affirmed was ordered modified. It was held, therefore, that when the cause again came before the superior court it was proper for that court under the provisions of the statute to allow additional attorneys’ fees for services rendered in the Supreme Court. The allowance of the additional fees in

  WATHEN, Chief Justice.
 

  We are called on to decide whether a person who is diagnosed as being subject to compulsive sexual behavior may be considered as mentally disabled for purposes of the antidiscrimination provisions with respect to employment within the purview of the Federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973 or the Maine Human Rights Act. Plaintiff Donald C. Winston appeals from an order of the Superior Court (Androscoggin County,
  
   Alexander, J.)
  
  granting summary judgment in favor of defendants Maine Technical College System (MTCS), Central Maine Technical College (CMTC), and Richard Conrath.
  
   1
  
  He contends that genuine issues of material fact remain and that defendants are not entitled to a judgment on his claim that the termination of his employment constitutes unlawful discrimination on the basis of his mental handicap of compulsive sexual addiction in violation of section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C.A. § 794 (Pamph.1993), the Maine Human Rights Act, 5 M.R.S.A. §§ 4551-4632 (1989 & Supp.1992), and the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution as enforced by 42 U.S.C.A. § 1983 (1981). The applicable law in effect at the time the Superior Court rendered its decision excluded sexual behavior disorders from the definition of a disabled individual. We, therefore, affirm the judgment.
 

  The factual assertions viewed in the light most favorable to plaintiff may be summarized as follows: Plaintiff taught in the MTCS for nineteen years. He was a tenured English instructor at CMTC in 1989 when he was terminated for violating the school’s sexual harassment policy by kissing one of his eighteen-year-old female students after a sexually suggestive conversation. Plaintiff asserts that the kiss was consensual, but he acknowledges that the kiss was inappropriate and he immediately apologized to the student several times. He then met with Conrath, disclosing that he was “sexually obsessive” and that he had had some involvement with a student, but that he had taken care of it. Twenty days later the student told Conrath that plaintiff had sexually harassed her. The charges were investigated. During this period Conrath made numerous references to his concern for plaintiffs mental health and commented that he thought plaintiff was “deeply troubled psychologically.”
  
   2
  
  Plaintiff was subsequently discharged. Although the termination letter refers only to the single incident of inappropriate behavior with a student, defendants were aware of four prior instances of sexual behavior with students.
  
   3
  


  After his termination, plaintiff filed a grievance under the collective bargaining agreement of his union, the Maine State Teachers’ Association. The union subsequently filed for arbitration under the
   
   *73
   
  agreement. After eleven days of hearings the arbitrator denied the grievance, finding that CMTC and MTCS did not violate the collective bargaining agreement in discharging plaintiff.
  
   4
  
  The union declined plaintiff’s request to appeal the arbitrator’s decision.
 

  Plaintiff subsequently filed this lawsuit, claiming that he was terminated because of his “mental handicap of sexual addiction.” The record contains evaluations of plaintiff’s condition by three mental health professionals, two of whom diagnosed plaintiff’s sexual addiction as Impulse Control Disorder Not Otherwise Specified, based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (3d ed. rev. 1987). Both experts stated that the disorder led to plaintiff’s termination, that the addiction is a permanent condition, that it was therefore unlikely that plaintiff would be hired in another teaching position, and that plaintiff is currently capable of performing his job as a teacher, including contact with students, without accommodation. The third expert testified that he does not believe that the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual is intended to be applied to sexual behavior, but even if it were, plaintiff would not meet the requisite criteria because plaintiff’s behavior was controllable rather than compulsive.
 

  The Superior Court granted a summary judgment in favor of defendants on all claims, ruling as a matter of law that plaintiff’s claimed disability of impulse control disorder does not qualify him for protection under applicable laws protecting persons with disabilities from employment discrimination.
 

  As a preliminary matter, we reject defendants’ argument that the arbitrator’s decision precludes the assertion of plaintiff’s claim under anti-discrimination statutes and establishes conclusively that harassment occurred. Defendants cite
  
   Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp.,
  
  500 U.S. 20, 111 S.Ct. 1647, 114 L.Ed.2d 26 (1991) for the proposition that employment discrimination claims may be the subject of binding arbitration when an employee agrees to arbitrate statutory claims.
  
   5
  
  By merely joining a union, however, without specifically contracting to arbitrate statutory employment discrimination claims, an employee is not precluded from asserting such claims in litigation.
 

  Our analysis begins with section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Act) that provides that: “[n]o otherwise qualified individual with a disability ... shall, solely by reason of his or her disability, be ... subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.” 29 U.S.C.A. § 794. A disabled individual is defined as one who: “(i) has a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more of such person’s major life activities, (ii) has a record of such an impairment, or (iii) is regarded as having such an impairment.”
  
   Id.
  
  § 706(8)(B). The Department of Health, Education and Welfare promulgated regulations offering guidance on the scope of section 504. Those regulations provide that “mental impairment” is “any mental or psychological disorder, such as ... emotional or mental illness,” 45 C.F.R. § 84.-3(j)(2)(i)(B) (1992), and define “major life activities” to include working.
  
   Id.
  
  § 84.3(j)(2)(ii). The appendix to the regulations indicates that the Act should not be limited to traditional handicaps. 45 C.F.R. pt. 84, app. A at 377 (1992).
 

 
   *74
   
  Although not raised by the parties, we note that, effective October 29, 1992, the Act was amended to provide that the term “individual with a disability” does not include an individual on the basis of certain conditions, including sexual behavior disorders. Pub.L. 102-569, § 102, 106 Stat. 4349 (1992) (codified at 29 U.S.C.A. § 706(8)(F) (Pamph.1993)).
  
   6
  
  Plaintiffs claimed addiction is a sexual behavior disorder. Because the Superior Court ruled on plaintiff’s discrimination claim after the effective date of the amendment, the court properly could have relied on the amendment to conclude that plaintiff had no claim under the Act as a matter of law. In
  
   Bradley v. School Board of City of Richmond,
  
  416 U.S. 696, 711, 94 S.Ct. 2006, 2016, 40 L.Ed.2d 476 (1974), the United States Supreme Court held that “a court is to apply the law in effect at the time it renders its decision....” This establishes a presumption that a new statute should be applied retroactively even if it “does not explicitly recite that it is to be applied to pending cases,” and rejects the proposition that “a change in the law is to be given effect in a pending case only where that is the clear and stated intention of the legislature.”
  
   Id.
  
  at 715, 94 S.Ct. at 2018. Here, there is no clear evidence of a congressional intent for or against the retroactive application of section 706(8)(F). Therefore, we find that the amendment could have been relied on by the Superior Court to support its ruling.
  
   7
  


  We next address whether a sexual impulse control disorder can constitute a legal disability under the Maine Human Rights Act (MHRA), 5 M.R.S.A. §§ 4551-4632. The provisions of the MHRA regarding mental disability are very similar to those contained in the Act. The MHRA prohibits the discharge of an employee because of a mental disability, except when based on a bona fide occupational qualification.
  
   Id.
  
  § 4572(1)(A) (Supp.1992). The MHRA defines “mental disability” as “any disability ... or mental condition caused by ... illness, and includes the ... mental condition of a person that constitutes a substantial disability as determined ... by a psychiatrist or psychologist ...”
  
   Id.
  
  § 4553(7-A) (Supp.1992). The Maine Human Rights Commission has supplemented the statutory definition by regulation as follows: “1. An applicant or employee who has a ‘physical or mental handicap’ means any person who has a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more of such person’s major life activities, has a record of such impairment, ou is regarded as having such an impairment.” Me. Human Rights Comm’n, Employment Reg. § 3.02(C)(1). The regulations also provide that the term ‘mental impairment’ includes emotional illness, that ‘major life activities’ includes working, and that one is ‘regarded as having an impairment’ if the employer treats him as having an impairment and as being substantially limited by it.
  
   Id.
  
  § 3.02(C)(2). Finally, the regulations state that “the remedial provisions of the [MHRA] shall be given broad construction and its exceptions shall be construed narrowly.”
  
   Id.
  
  § 3.01(C)(1). There is no explicit exclusion of sexual behavior disorders from the definition of a disabled individual.
 

  We have stated that because the MHRA generally tracks federal anti-discrimination statutes, it is appropriate to look to federal precedent for guidance in interpreting the MHRA.
  
   Maine Human Rights Comm’n
  
 
   *75
   

   v. City of Auburn,
  
  408 A.2d 1253, 1261 (Me.1979). Unfortunately, a review of federal case law concerning conditions that constitute a disability provides minimal guidance in determining when it is appropriate to impose categorical limits on the definition of a disabled individual. Section 706(8)(F), however, clarifies the original intent of Congress as to the parameters of the definition of a disabled individual under federal law. Because the MHRA was modeled after the Act, and the Act was not intended to protect individuals with sexual behavior disorders, we conclude that plaintiffs condition is not protected under the MHRA as a matter of law. We further note that the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual does not officially include sexual addiction, that defendant’s psychiatrist’s opinion is based on a very broad “process” addiction model representing the view of a “subset” of physicians, and that the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) also specifically excludes “sexual behavior disorders” from the term “disability,” 42 U.S.C.A. § 12211(b)(1) (Pamph.1998).
 

  Plaintiff next argues that he has a cognizable claim pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Defendants counter that this claim must fail because neither MTCS nor CMTC are “persons” subject to suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.
  
   8
  
  In
  
   Will v. Michigan Dept of State Police,
  
  491 U.S. 58, 109 S.Ct. 2304, 105 L.Ed.2d 45 (1989), the Supreme Court held that neither a state, state agency, nor state official sued in an official capacity is a “person” subject to suit pursuant to § 1983. Therefore, if the state is the real party in interest, the action is not being maintained against a “person” subject to suit within the meaning of § 1983.
 

  In determining whether the state is the real party in interest we look to (1) the relationship between the state and the defendant to determine if the defendant is an alter ego of the state or if it is relatively autonomous; and (2) whether funds to pay a judgment would come from the state treasury.
  
   See
  
  1 Joseph G. Cook & John L. Sobieski, Jr., Civil Rights Actions § 2.01(D), at 2-60.11, 2-60.14 (1990) [hereinafter Cook & Sobieski].
 

  With regard to the first issue, the evidence demonstrates that MTCS and CMTC have an intimate relationship with the state and can reasonably be regarded as an alter ego of the state. The MTCS is created by Title 20-A M.R.S.A. § 12702 (1993) which provides as follows:
 

  There is established the Maine Technical College System which shall be a body corporate and politic and a public instrumentality of the State and the exercise of the powers conferred by this chapter shall be deemed and held to be the performance of essential governmental functions. The system shall consist of the board of trustees, the Technical College Support Office and the technical colleges.
 

  Members of the Board of Trustees are appointed by the Governor for four year terms and must be confirmed by the Legislature.
  
   Id.
  
  § 12705(2). The Commissioners of Education, Economic and Community Development, and Labor serve ex officio.
  
   Id.
  
  § 12705(1). The Governor and Legislature approve the system’s budget prepared by the Board of Trustees which is “used in support of any requests to the Legislature for General Fund appropriations” needed to supplement other resources available to the system, and which is the basis of the system’s fiscal management plan.
  
   Id.
  
  §§ 12706(4)-(4-A). The Maine Technical College System is also defined as part of the “State” for purposes of the Maine Tort Claims Act. 14 M.R.S.A. § 8102(4) (Supp. 1992). Although the System has the power to own and transfer real estate, any such transfers are subject to the approval of the Legislature. 20-A M.R.S.A. § 12706(13).
 

 
   *76
   
  Plaintiff cites statutory provisions granting the MTCS the right to sue and be sued in its own name,
  
   id.
  
  § 12706(10), delegating extensive powers to the board of trustees,
  
   id.
  
  § 12706, and giving the MTCS the right to own and transfer real property, in support of his contention that the defendants are relatively autonomous from the state. Although the MTCS has considerable autonomy in regard to its daily operations, the critical functions of budgeting and funding remain subject to state control, and therefore defendants can reasonably be characterized as alter egos of the state.
 

  Plaintiff also asserts that because the MTCS has exclusive control over certain funds not received from the state, such as tuition payments and endowments, any judgment could be paid from these funds and the state treasury would not be implicated. We disagree. First, because almost all state agencies have access to non-state funds, this factor cannot be the determining one. Second, as a practical matter, even if a judgment were not paid directly with state funds, state appropriated funds would have to be used to replenish the funds expended.
 

  Because payment of a judgment would interfere with the state’s fiscal autonomy, and the MTCS is highly dependant on the state, we conclude that the state is a real party in interest.
  
   9
  
  Therefore, neither CMTC, MTCS, nor Conrath are “persons” within the meaning of § 1983 and the judgment was proper as to these claims.
 

  Plaintiff finally argues that the complaint states a claim against Conrath individually pursuant to § 1983. We disagree. Contrary to plaintiffs contention, Conrath is shielded by qualified immunity from personal liability for his discretionary acts, including the termination of plaintiffs employment.
  
   See Anderson v. Creighton,
  
  483 U.S. 635, 638, 107 S.Ct. 3034, 3038, 97 L.Ed.2d 523 (1987) (Generally, government officials performing discretionary functions have qualified immunity “shielding them from civil damages liability as long as their actions could reasonably have been thought consistent with rights they are alleged to have violated”). Qualified immunity protects “all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.”
  
   Malley v. Briggs,
  
  475 U.S. 335, 341, 106 S.Ct. 1092, 1096, 89 L.Ed.2d 271 (1986). That is not the case here.
 

  The entry is:
 

  Judgment affirmed.
 

  All concurring.
 


   1
  

   . Conrath was the Director of Central Maine Vocational Technical Institute, now CMTC, during the 1988-1989 school year.
  


   2
  

   . CMTC was aware that plaintiff had been experiencing a great deal of stress in the years preceding the incident that led to his termination. Plaintiff was granted an emergency leave in March 1987 because of personal stress. In the spring of 1987 he had a breakdown in a meeting with the school’s assistant director. He began seeking out prostitutes in the summer of 1988, and disclosed his concern over this behavior to his Department Chair. These facts and Con-rath’s remarks are the basis of plaintiffs claim that he was terminated because of his asserted disability.
  


   3
  

   .In 1983 or 1984 a female student filed a claim of sexual harassment against plaintiff, but the school never informed him of the charge and he denies any misconduct. While an instructor at Northern Maine Technical College, plaintiff admits to having consensual sexual relationships with two adult students, one of whom was never enrolled in his class. The fourth incident occurred in the fall of 1988 when he made a date with one of his students and then kissed her. The next day plaintiff broke the date. Only the 1983 incident resulted in a complaint.
  


   4
  

   . The agreement provides that termination may be only for just cause and establishes a policy against all forms of illegal discrimination.
  


   5
  

   . We conclude that the instant situation fits within the rule set out in
   
    Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co,

   466 U.S. 284, 104 S.Ct. 1799, 80 L.Ed.2d 302 (1984), that the arbitration of contract-based claims pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement does not preclude subsequent judicial resolution of statutory claims. This is true even when, as here, the claim was before the arbitrator and the collective bargaining agreement prohibits the type of discrimination alleged in the suit claiming a violation of statutory rights.

   (F) For the purposes of sections 791, 793, and 794 of this title, the term ""individual with a disability” does not include an individual on the basis of—
  

   (i) transvestism, transsexualism, pedophilia, exhibitionism, voyeurism, gender identity disorders not resulting from physical impairments, or other sexual behavior disorders;
  

   (ii) compulsive gambling, kleptomania, or pyromania; or
  

   (iii)psychoactive substance use disorders resulting from current illegal use of drugs

6206916,6338327,62969502,Hart Island Committee v. Koch,"In the Matter of the Hart Island Committee v. Edward I. Koch, as Mayor of the City of New York","
OPINION OF THE COURT
Edward H. Lehner, J.
This is a motion for a preliminary injunction by a committee of City Island organizations (Chamber of Commerce, Civic Association, Preservation Association and American Legion Post) to enjoin construction by the City of New York of a correctional facility on Hart Island. This island lies within the city, approximately one third of a mile from City Island in Long Island Sound, and is reached by ferry from a dock on City Island. City Island is reached from the Bronx mainland by a two-lane bridge.
The bases for plaintiff’s application are the following: (1) defendants have failed to file an environmental impact statement (EIS) prior to commencing construction, in violation of the State Environmental Quality Review Act (SEQRA) and the City Environmental Quality Review procedure (CEQR); (2) defendants have failed to comply with the City Uniform Land Use Review Procedure (ULURP); (3) defendants are operating a septic system in violation of the Federal Clean Water Act of 1977 (33 USC § 1251 et seq.) and article 17 of the State Environmental Conservation Law (ECL); and (4) defendants are carrying out construction in a tidal wetlands zone without a permit in violation of ECL article 25.
The instant application is supported by various affidavits, but a complaint has not as yet been filed, which failure the defendants assert is a fatal defect in the application.
FACTS
Section 9-103 (formerly § 623 [l]-2.0) of the Administrative Code of the City of New York provides that the ""lands and buildings on Hart’s Island shall be utilized for the segregation of prisoners transferred thereto by the commissioner of correction.” The Department of Correction (the Department) has housed inmates on the island since 1895 with the exception of three periods (1950-1954; 1966-1982, when Phoenix House operated a drug rehabilitation center at the Department’s facilities; and July-Sept. 1986).
During the periods when prisoners were not housed on Hart *523Island, inmates worked there to handle burials at Potter’s Field, an area on the island where unclaimed bodies are buried. Currently the Department houses 60 inmates on the island who do work on burials and cleaning.
On March 26, 1987, the Board of Estimate passed both Resolution No. 58, which called for the ""expansion and reopening of several modular dormitories on Hart Island” and appropriated moneys therefor; and Resolution No. 73, which authorized the Department of General Services to enter into contracts (with limited competitive bidding) for the purchase and installation of four modular housing buildings of 100 beds each on the island. The latter resolution further called for the renovation of existing structures, as well as the installation and connection of utility services and improvements on the dock and waterfront necessary for the operation and occupancy of the buildings.
Although the city has not complied with ULURP, nor filed an EIS, the Mayor held a ""Town Hall” meeting in the area on June 24, 1987 to explain the city’s plans, and city officials have been in contact with the community board for the area.
Some of the commitments made by defendants are as follows: only the ""lowest risk” prisoners, with less than 120 days remaining on their sentences, will be assigned to Hart Island; all visits to inmates will take place at the Bronx House of Detention; only two buses per day will be used to transport prisoners for such visits; and a Department shuttle bus will transport personnel to the ferry dock from a parking area on the Bronx mainland.
FAILURE TO SERVE A COMPLAINT
Defendants assert that ""when the basis for the requested preliminary injunction is the same as the basis for the underlying action, a complaint must be submitted in support of the preliminary injunction motion”, and cite Matter of Seplow v Century Operating Co. (56 AD2d 515) in support. The essence of the holding in that case was that where the basis for the injunction is the ""nature of the plaintiffs action”, a complaint is required. However, here if injunctive relief were to lie, it would not be based on the nature of the action (i.e., an action seeking a permanent injunction under the second alternative ground set forth in CPLR 6301), but rather on the assertion that defendants were performing acts in violation of plaintiffs rights. Hence, the failure to serve a complaint is of no conse*524quence in the consideration of this motion. (See, Somerset R. R. Corp. v Graham, 89 AD2d 819; Fairfield Presidential Assocs. v Pollins, 85 AD2d 653; Taylor v Haddad Corp., 118 Misc 2d 253; Siegel, NY Prac § 329.)
SEQRA
SEQRA was enacted by the Legislature in 1975. The policy goals and procedures set forth therein are summarized by the Court of Appeals in Matter of Jackson v New York State Urban Dev. Corp. (67 NY2d 400, 414).
CEQR was promulgated by the Mayor as Executive Order 91 issued in August 1977 to implement SEQRA in the City of New York, and its provisions closely parallel the State law.
A basic determination under SEQRA and CEQR is whether an EIS is required in connection with a proposed project, the resolution of which depends on whether the project ""may have a significant effect on the environment.” (ECL 8-0109 [2].)
Here the defendants claim an exemption from filing an EIS prior to the commencement of any work under the ""limited and temporary” emergency provision set forth in 6 NYCRR 617.2 (q) (4), which reads as follows: ""[Ejmergency actions which are immediately necessary on a limited and temporary basis for the protection or preservation of life, health, property or natural resources, provided that such actions are directly related to the emergency and are performed to cause the least change or disturbance, practicable under the circumstances, to the environment. Any decision to fund, approve or directly undertake other activities after the emergency has expired is fully subject to the review procedures of this Part”. A similar emergency provision is contained in CEQR.
Defendants represent that a statement is being prepared ""which will enable the lead agencies to determine if the project has a significant environmental impact” requiring the preparation of an EIS.
The emergency claimed here is the overcrowding in the city prisons which in 1983 caused Federal Judge Morris Lasker to direct the release of over 600 detainees. The city asserts that since 1983 it has added 4,911 prison beds, and expects to add over 7,000 beds by 1993. In recent months Judge Lasker temporarily permitted the city to house sentenced inmates in cells under the minimum State standard of 60 square feet per person.
There is no question that the shortage of prison beds has *525created, and continues to create, a crisis for the City of New York, which can be said to be an emergency. It is clearly not the type of emergency that will result in imminent disaster if action is not taken forthwith. However, the creation of prison space to handle the increasing numbers of persons detained and sentenced for imprisonment in city prisons requires action, with some dispatch, to comply with the prisoners’ constitutional rights and avoid another forced release of inmates.
In two cases reaching the Court of Appeals, correction officials were permitted under the aforesaid emergency regulation to commence construction prior to the filing of an EIS.
In Matter of Board of Visitors — Marcy Psychiatric Center v Coughlin (60 NY2d 14) the court permitted renovation of a mental institution to permit its use as a correctional facility. The court noted that no action was being taken that would be irrevocable and no prisoners were to be transferred until the SEQRA process was complete. In that case the Commissioner of Correctional Services determined that the renovation would have an impact on the environment and issued a ""positive declaration” that an EIS would be issued. In commenting on the emergency regulation the court said:
""Concededly the case now before us does not present the classic example where immediate action is required to meet an emergency in which the effect of the action may be immediately realized. There is apparently no quick solution which will immediately eliminate the problems of overcrowded jails. But that does not mean that there is no crisis or that there is no need to take immediate action to lay the foundation for a program which may provide relief in the near future. State officials confronted with an ever increasing influx of inmates into a prison system, already filled to well over 100% of capacity, can hardly be said to be acting irrationally if they conclude that some action must be taken immediately to avert in the future the violence which has occurred in the past.
""Neither can it be said that the decision to take immediate action at this time is unreasonable because prison overcrowding is a problem of long standing in this State. Emergencies are often precipitated by the failure to take needed action in the past despite adequate warning.” (Supra, at 20.)
In Matter of Gerges v Koch (62 NY2d 84) the Board of Estimate approved a program for the renovation of the Brooklyn Navy Yard Brig (a Federal facility) into a city medium *526security prison. After commencement of a proceeding to enjoin the renovation, a ""negative declaration” was issued by city agencies finding that the use of the brig would not have a significant impact on the environment. The Appellate Division (101 AD2d 201) reversed Special Term’s grant of an injunction, ruling that the emergency declaration by the Commissioner was not irrational, arbitrary or capricious ""given the facts of the city’s critical shortage of jail capacity and the renewed expansion of the jail population”. (Supra, at 204.) In affirming, the Court of Appeals declined to review the ""negative declaration”, ruling that such determination could only be reviewed in a separate proceeding. (Supra, at 96.)
Other cases relying on the emergency regulation to deny injunctive relief to proposed action are: Spring-Gar Community Civic Assn. v Homes for Homeless (135 Misc 2d 689) and Vann v Koch (NYU, Feb. 20, 1987, at 16, col 4 [Sup Ct, Kings County]).
It appears, however, that plaintiff is correct in its contention that in none of these cases was the validity of the emergency regulation raised. Plaintiff urges that since the legislation does not authorize an exemption from compliance based on an emergency, the Commissioner of the Department of Environmental Conservation lacked authority to promulgate the regulation.
On the issue it should first be noted that the subject regulation is to be differentiated from the ""exclusions” authorized in ECL 8-0111 (5) and carried forward into the regulations at 6 NYCRR 617.2 (p). An EIS need not ever be filed for matters excluded, whereas the emergency provision is ""limited and temporary”. (6 NYCRR 617.2 [q] [4].)
Second, a regulation adopted by an agency empowered to promulgate regulations and administer a body of law is not to be disturbed by a court unless "" 'so lacking in reason for its promulgation that it is essentially arbitrary’ ” (Matter of Bernstein v Toia, 43 NY2d 437, 448), and ""[t]he interpretation given a statute by the administering agency 'if not irrational or unreasonable, should be upheld.’ ” (Ostrer v Schenck, 41 NY2d 782, 786.)
Third, the emergency regulation (in a slightly different form) has been on the books since 1978, and although the Legislature has amended SEQRA since then, it has not in any manner sought to affect this provision. This is some indication that the regulation is not contrary to the Legislature’s intent. *527(See, Matter of National Elevator Indus. v New York State Tax Commn., 49 NY2d 538, 548.) ""A fundamental rule of construction provides that the Legislature, when enacting an amendment or new legislation, is presumed to know and be aware of the law existing at that time” (Matter of Thomas v Bethlehem Steel Corp., 95 AD2d 118, 120).
The court finds that the adoption of emergency regulations is reasonable when considering the goals of SEQRA and CEQR as it is prudent that at times government be able to act promptly when faced with a condition that cannot await the completion of the SEQRA process. Therefore, the regulation is valid.
Although the prison crisis does not have the same immediacy as the need to respond to a flood or other disaster, the Court of Appeals in Marcy (supra) and Gerges (supra) (without being faced with a challenge to the validity of the regulation) concluded that the prison crisis does fall within the definition of an emergency as used in the regulation.
ULURP
Section 197-c (a) of the New York City Charter provides that ""proposals and applications by any person or agency for changes, approvals, contracts, consents, permits or authorization thereof, respecting the use, development or improvement of real property subject to city regulation shall be reviewed pursuant to a uniform review procedure” in certain cases. Plaintiff asserts that the proposal for the new prison on Hart Island requires review under paragraph (5) of said section which refers to ""[s]ite selection for capital projects”.
Defendants assert that review is unnecessary as ""there has been no real estate transaction or change in land use constituting a site selection,” as ""with some interruptions Hart Island has functioned as a correction facility for over 100 years and, in the 1960s, over 1,000 inmates were incarcerated there.”
In Matter of Gerges v Koch (supra, at 93) the court found that the license obtained from the Federal Government to use the navy yard brig for a city correctional facility was a "" '[s]ite selection for [a] capital project’ ”. The situation here is obviously different because of prior city ownership of the property. However, the proposal, which contemplates the demolition of existing prison buildings and the replacement with four modular units with a total capacity of 400 beds, will *528result in a prison over six times larger by population than that now existing. This, in actuality, is the construction of a new and substantially larger prison, which will require a substantial increase in staff and support services. Therefore, the court finds that in determining to develop this new correctional facility, the Board of Estimate made a site selection for a capital project, and should have complied with the ULURP procedure.
In Gerges (supra), faced with its determination that the city should have complied with ULURP before completing the renovation of the brig, the court, nevertheless, declined to enjoin the city from transferring prisoners to the facility. In so ruling, the court observed that the ""determination of the availability of such relief depends not alone on the right of the party seeking it but as well on the appropriateness of its issuance in the circumstances in which it is sought” (Matter of Gerges v Koch, 62 NY2d, supra, at 95). In considering the circumstances, the court went on to say: ""We take note that respondents are confronted, in consequence of orders of the Federal courts and otherwise, with an emergency of compelling and dangerous dimension and seriousness. That this emergency might have been foreseen and that municipal officials may have been derelict in not earlier having made appropriate provision for its resolution and having assured the availability of adequate detention facilities does not negate the existence of the present crisis.” (Supra, at 95.)
FACTUAL ISSUES
Plaintiff’s claims that the city is operating a septic system in violation of Federal and State laws, and is carrying out construction in tidal wetlands without a permit in violation of State law are denied by defendants. On a motion for a preliminary injunction, ""[i]f key facts are in dispute, the relief will be denied”. (Faberge Intl. v Di Pino, 109 AD2d 235, 240; see also, First Natl. Bank v Highland Hardwoods, 98 AD2d 924.)
CONCLUSION
Insofar as the instant application is based on a failure to comply with SEQRA, CEQR and ULURP, the court denies the application to enjoin the renovation work, but does hereby enjoin the transfer of any prisoners to the facility until the processes required by the said laws are completed. Should the appropriate agencies render a negative declaration, determin*529ing that an EIS is not required, such decision, as indicated in Matter of Gerges v Koch (supra) will be reviewable in a separate proceeding.
With respect to the claims of violations of other statutes, on which there are sharply disputed issues of fact, the motion for injunctive relief is denied. However, in light of the claims asserted, the court will grant a prompt trial of this action upon the filing of a note of issue and statement of readiness.

  Opinion
 

  KAY, P. J.
 

  Insurance Code section 1704
  
   1
  
  requires that certain kinds of insurance may be sold only by what are known as “appointed agents”— persons for whom the insurer has filed with the Insurance Commissioner a notice of appointment formally designating the person to act on the insurer’s behalf. A trio of related insurers (which for purposes of simplicity will hereinafter be collectively referred to as Mercury) sold policies of automobile insurance within the state through “broker-agents” who are not appointed agents. Suit was instituted to stop this practice, as well as permitting the “broker-agents” to charge consumers broker fees added to the advertised price of insurance. The trial court determined that both of these practices ran afoul of the unfair competition law (UCL) (Bus. & Prof. Code, § 17200 et seq.) and permanently enjoined them.
 

  The primary issue pressed by Mercury is whether its practice of employing broker-agents who are not appointed agents has been sanctioned by the Legislature and therefore enjoys a “safe harbor” from liability under the UCL. Although the issue is not free from all doubt, on balance it appears from the governing statutes, particularly section 1704(a), that the Legislature has not created a safe harbor for this practice. We therefore affirm.
 

  BACKGROUND
 

  The trial court’s findings of fact and conclusions of law are best comprehended in light of the extensive statutory history that underpins the trial court’s reasoning. That history involves the evolution of the concepts of broker and agent in the insurance context.
 

  (A)
 

  Statutorily, an agent is defined as one who is “authorized, by and on behalf of an insurer, to transact all classes of insurance” except for life
   
   *929
   
  insurance (§§ 31, 1621) while a broker is “a person who, for compensation and on behalf of another person, transacts insurance other than life with, but not on behalf of, an insurer.” (§§ 33, 1623.)
 

  One of the leading treatises explains the fundamental distinction between an agent and a broker in these terms: “An ‘insurance broker’ is one who acts as a middleman between the insured and the insurer, soliciting insurance from the public under no employment from any special company, and, upon securing an order, placing it with a company selected by the insured or with a company selected by himself or herself; whereas an ‘insurance agent’ is one who represents an insurer under an employment by it. A broker is, in essence, employed in each instance as a special agent for a single purpose, while the very definition of agent indicates an ongoing and continuous relationship. . . . [B]rokers and insureds are ordinarily involved in what can be viewed as a series of discrete transactions, while agents and insureds tend to be under some duty to each other during the entire length of the relationship.” (3 Couch on Insurance (3d ed. 1997) § 45:1, pp. 45-3 to 45-4, fns. omitted; see 7 Appleman on Insurance 2d (Holmes ed. 1998), § 44.2, pp. 2-11; Croskey et al., Cal Practice Guide: Insurance Litigation (The Rutter Group 1997)
  
   ff
  
  2:2-2:7, pp. 2-1 to 2-3 (rev. # 1, 2004.) In 1976 one Court of Appeal held that a broker is not an agent of the insurer, but is an independent contractor acting as agent for the insured. “The most definitive characteristic of an insurance agent is his authority to bind his principal, the insurer; an insurance broker has no such authority .... [T]he broker does not have authority to bind an insurer and ... the insurance company must first execute the binder or policy; a broker does not execute a policy without a prior authorization from the insurer. In contrast, the agent is authorized to execute the binder himself.”
  
   (Marsh & McLennan of Cal., Inc. v. City of Los Angeles
  
  (1976) 62 Cal.App.3d 108, 117-118 [132 Cal.Rptr. 796].)
 

  “An individual cannot act as an insurance agent in California without a valid license issued by the commissioner of insurance. (Ins. Code, § 1631.) In addition to possessing a license, an insurance agent must be authorized by an insurance carrier to transact insurance business on the carrier’s behalf. This authorization must be evidenced by a notice of agency appointment on file with the Department of Insurance. (Ins. Code, § 1704, subd. (a).)”
  
   (Loehr v. Great Republic Ins. Co.
  
  (1990) 226 Cal.App.3d 727, 732-733 [276 Cal.Rptr. 667].) Unlike an agent, a broker does not act for the insurer, and the insurer is not liable for the broker’s acts or omissions. (E.g.,
  
   Kurtz, Richards, Wilson & Co.
  
  v.
  
   Insurance Communicators Marketing Corp.
  
  (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 1249, 1257-1258 [16 Cal.Rptr.2d 259];
  
   Reid v. Northern Assur. Co.
  
  (1923) 63 Cal.App. 114, 127 [218 P. 290].) Because a broker, unlike an appointed agent, does not have the insurer available as a source of compensation for aggrieved insureds, the broker is required to post a bond before being allowed to operate. (§ 1662.)
 

 
   *930
   
  Nevertheless, there is no absolute dichotomy between agents and brokers. In 1917, in a noninsurance context, our Supreme Court recognized that a person could be the agent of both parties to a commercial transaction.
  
   (Glenn
  
  v.
  
   Rice
  
  (1917) 174 Cal. 269, 272 [162 P. 1020].) This principle of “dual agency” is well established as a general principle of agency law. (See Rest.2d Agency, §§ 313, 391, 392.) In January of 1953, a Court of Appeal applied it for the first time to the insurance context. In
  
   Maloney
  
  v.
  
   Rhode Island Ins. Co.
  
  (1953) 115 Cal.App.2d 238 [251 P.2d 1027], it was held that a broker acting for the insured could also act as the agent of the insurer “[w]hen the broker accepts the policy from the insurer and the premium from the assured, he has elected to act for the insurer to deliver the policy and to collect the premium.”
  
   (Id.
  
  at p. 244.)
 

  Brokers liked the result in
  
   Maloney
  
  but did not want to be required to be licensed as agents as well as brokers. At their prompting, the Insurance Commissioner sponsored a bill that would codify the result of
  
   Maloney
  
  and authorize brokers to act as the insurer’s agent while collecting premiums and delivering policies. (See Cal. Ins. Com., Enrolled Bill Rep. on Assem. Bill No. 1417 (1952 Reg. Sess.) prepared for Governor Warren (June 16, 1953).) The bill was signed into law in July 1953, six months after
  
   Maloney
  
  was decided. (Stats. 1953, ch. 1732, § 2, p. 3482 [enacting former § 1660.5].) The basis for what is now section 1732 provided: “A person licensed as an insurance broker may act as an insurance agent in collecting and transmitting premium or returning] premium funds and delivering policies and other documents evidencing insurance.”
 

  Here matters more or less remained until passage of Proposition 103 in 1988. That initiative made the Insurance Commissioner (Commissioner) an elected official (§ 12900), rolled back car insurance rates (§ 1861.01), and made rates subject to the Commissioner’s approval (§ 1861.05). It also directed that every person who meets the statutory standards as a “good driver” (§ 1861.025) was entitled a rate “at least 20% below the rate the insured would otherwise have been charged for the same coverage.” (§ 1861.02, subd. (b)(2).) “An insurer shall not refuse to offer and sell a Good Driver Discount policy to any person who meets the standards” (§ 1861.02, subd. (b)(1)).
 

  In 1990 the Legislature added the term “broker-agent” to section 1625, which defines “fire and casualty licensee,” and to section 1732. (Stats. 1990, ch. 1420, §§ 4, 57, pp. 6446, 6463.)
  
   2
  
  The same bill amended section 1704(a) to provide in pertinent part: “Every applicant for a license as a life agent, a
   
   *931
   
  fire and casualty broker-agent to act as an insurance agent, or a travel insurance agent shall have filed on his or her behalf with the commissioner a notice of appointment to act as an agent executed by an insurer . . . appointing the applicant, upon licensing, its agent within this state” (Stats. 1990, ch. 1420, § 38, p. 6457).
 

  Five years later “broker-agent” was added to the statute governing the termination of a broker or agent operating pursuant to a written contract. (§ 769, as amended by Stats. 1995, ch. 921, § 1, p. 7029.) Applicable to “a written agency or written brokerage contract[] where the broker-agent represents the insurer,” the amended statute specified that advance notice of termination was not required if “the broker-agent [][] . . . [f] Exceeded his or her binding authority under the agency or brokerage contract.” (§ 769, subds. (a), (b)(1).)
 

  In January of 2000, the Commissioner sent Mercury a draft “Notice of Noncompliance.” The gist of the notice was much the same as this litigation—that Mercury was employing brokers who “are operating as de facto agents” but who were being advertised by Mercury as independent. The notice was discussed at a meeting later that month between Mercury and representatives of the Department of Insurance. Mercury took the position that “statutes and court decisions do not clearly define the difference between agents and brokers.” One of the Commissioner’s representatives proposed that Mercury “draft a bill that defines agents and brokers” for submission to the Legislature. Mercury did so, but the Commissioner opposed the bill on the ground that it would “ ‘blur’ the long-established legal distinctions between ‘agents’ and ‘brokers’ and would create confusion for the consumer . . . .” The Legislature passed the bill and the Governor signed it. It amended section 1623, which then provided; “An insurance broker is a person who, for compensation and on behalf of another person, transacts insurance other than life with, but not on behalf of, an insurer.” The Mercury bill added the following language: “Every application for insurance submitted by an insurance broker to an insurer shall show that the person is acting as an insurance broker. If the application shows that the person is acting as an insurance broker and is licensed as an insurance broker in the state in which the application is submitted, it shall be presumed, for licensing purposes only, that the person is acting as an insurance broker. Nothing in this section is intended to affect any rights or remedies otherwise available under the law.”
  
   3
  
  (Stats. 2000, ch. 1074, § 1.)
 

 
   *932
   
  In 2000-2001, the Legislature enacted a number of statutes dealing with the scope of a “personal lines licensee.” A person holding such a license is “authorized to transact automobile insurance, . . . including insurance for recreational vehicles used for noncommercial purposes, personal watercraft insurance, residential property insurance . . . including earthquake and flood insurance, inland marine insurance covering personal property, and umbrella or excess liability insurance providing coverage when written over one or more underlying automobile or residential property insurance policies . . . .” A personal lines “broker-agent” is given the same authorization. (§ 1625.5, subd. (a).) A fire and casualty licensee is defined as “a person authorized to act as an insurance agent, broker or solicitor, and a fire and casualty broker-agent” and “authorized to transact 24-hour care coverage . . . and any coverage that a personal lines licensee is authorized to transact” (§ 1625; see Stats. 2000, ch. 321, § 2; Stats. 2001, ch. 174, §§ 1-2).
 

  Finally, in 2002, the Legislature again amended section 1704(a) to provide in pertinent part; “Life agents, travel agents, and fire and casualty insurance agents shall not act as an agent of an insurer unless the insurer has filed with the commissioner a notice of appointment, executed by the insurer, appointing the licensee as the insurer’s agent” (Stats. 2002, ch. 203, § 15).
 

  (B)
 

  This litigation commenced when plaintiff Robert Krumme filed a complaint “on Behalf of the General Public.” Plaintiff stated he was challenging “the practices of the defendant insurance companies in selling automobile and other personal lines insurance policies through insurance producers
  
   4
  
  denominated as ‘brokers’ who in fact act as defendants’ agents, but who nevertheless charge consumers ‘brokers fees.’ The broker fees are made part of—but are charged in addition to—the rates and premiums for defendants’ products that were previously approved pursuant to Proposition 103 ... . Defendants do not disclose the broker fees to the Department of Insurance, and the broker fees have not been reviewed or approved as required by law.” The relief sought by plaintiff was “a judgment commanding restitution and disgorgement of monies and benefits taken illegally . . . and for injunctive relief to stop these business practices.”
 

  At the conclusion of a four-day bench trial, the trial court issued 17 pages of findings of fact and conclusions of law. Although Mercury states in its opening brief that many of the findings “are either unsupported by the
   
   *933
   
  evidence or are otherwise flawed,” it chooses to forgo challenging them because it sees issues of law—the trial court’s erroneous conclusions of law in its application of statutes—as sufficient to require reversal of the injunction. In light of this approach, we presume the findings are supported by substantial evidence and summarize the relevant facts as set forth in the findings. (See
  
   State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins. Co.
  
  v.
  
   Quackenbush
  
  (1999) 77 Cal.App.4th 65, 72 [91 Cal.Rptr.2d 381].)
 

  Until 1989, Mercury only sold insurance through approximately 800 appointed agents. Beginning in 1989, Mercury terminated the appointments of approximately 700 of those agents and made them brokers. In general, the change in title did not alter the ability or authority to bind Mercury, but it did allow the former agents to charge brokerage fees. Policies sold by brokers or appointed agents used the same application forms, rating guidelines, and underwriting guidelines, all of which were provided by Mercury. Both brokers and appointed agents advertise that they “represent” Mercury. Mercury subjects agents and brokers to the same amount of training and supervision. Mercury does not object to brokers charging brokerage fees (in addition to policy premiums), but it will discipline appointed agents who attempt to charge such fees. In its comparative rate advertising, Mercury does not advise that brokerage fees may be added to the advertised cost of insurance. This practice may provide a competitive advantage to Mercury, which “is aware of, and concerned about, misleading the public with its comparative rate print advertisements,” but it “has not established any system to discover or monitor . . . and has no way of knowing” whether brokerage fees are being assessed. Mercury submits its insurance rates and premiums—but not the brokerage fees—to the California Department of Insurance for approval.
 

  As conclusions of law, the trial court determined:
 

  Brokers and appointed agents were “functionally indistinguishable” in their relationship to Mercury.
 

  In view of the substance of their dealings with Mercury, “[b]ecause these ‘brokers’ have transacted, and do transact, insurance on behalf of Mercury, they cannot be considered ‘insurance brokers’ for licensing purposes within the meaning of Insurance Code § 1623 and are instead ‘insurance agents’ within the meaning of Insurance Code § 1621.”
 

  Mercury was incorrect in maintaining that its brokers could be both an agent and a broker, “the equivalent of a dual agent. Rather, dual agency ... is permitted only in a very limited context, the authority to collect premiums and deliver policies. See Insurance Code § 1732 .... The purpose of this
   
   *934
   
  safe harbor is to maintain the broker-agent distinction while at the same time protecting insureds. It is not a device to confuse the established legal distinction between a ‘broker’ and an ‘agent’ so clearly announced in § 1621 and § 1623 of the Insurance Code. Any other contention that the ‘dual agency’ notion is a tacit override of the restrictions legislatively created by § 1621 and § 1623 must be discounted in light of the clear mandate articulated in these legal standards. . . . From at least July 1, 1996 to date, the ‘brokers’ have transacted insurance on behalf of Mercury outside the limited scope permitted by Insurance Code section 1732.”
 

  “The Court constmes Insurance Code § 1704(a) to require each insurance company who wishes to transact insurance in California to file Action Notices with the . . . Department of Insurance for all ‘fire and casualty broker-agent’ licensees who act in the capacity as an ‘insurance agent’ on the company’s behalf within the meaning of Insurance Code section 1621. This construction is the most consistent with the language of Section 1704(a), and with the statute’s purpose, which is to ensure that each such insurance company publicly identifies the broker-agent licensees acting on its behalf as a public acknowledgement of the company’s liability for the errors and omissions of the licensee. By its operative language, § 1704(a) merges the role of ‘broker-agent’ only in the limited context of ‘fire and casualty.’ The Legislature expressly left untouched the broader statutory distinctions and regulatory effect of § 1621 and § 1623 in other forms of insurance policies when it amended § 1704(a).”
 

  “From January 1, 1996 to date, Mercury has violated and continues to violate the letter, policy, and spirit of section 1704(a) by not filing Action Notices for ‘brokers’ selling Mercury personal lines auto insurance because the ‘brokers’ were and are acting in the capacity of insurance agents on Mercury’s behalf within the meaning of Insurance Code section 11621.”
 

  The court further concluded that because broker fees may be charged only by bona fide brokers, not persons and firms claiming to be brokers that are in reality appointed agents, the brokerage fees collected by Mercury’s “brokers” were illegal. “Mercury should have filed action notices for its ‘brokers.’ Its failure to do so violated and violates the spirit and policy of the common law of agency.
 

  “Mercury is vicariously liable under the [UCL] for these past and ongoing violations of the broker fee regulations and the common law by its ‘broker’ agents. The ‘brokers’ charged and charge these ‘broker fees’ in the course and scope of transacting insurance on behalf of Mercury, and therefore in the capacity of insurance agents within the meaning of section 1621 on behalf of Mercury.”
 

 
   *935
   
  “From at least July 1, 1996, Mercury has engaged and continues to engage in false advertising in violation of Business & Professions Code sections 17200 and 17500 by advertising rate comparisons without disclosing that broker fees may be added in addition to the premium advertised. These advertisements were and are likely to deceive consumers because undisclosed broker fees that materially affect the cost of the insurance and adversely affect the comparison of Mercury’s rates with those of the quoted competitors may be added at the time the consumer purchases Mercury insurance.”
 

  The court rejected Mercury’s claim that “plaintiff’s claims are subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the State Department of Insurance .... None of plaintiff’s claims challenges any rate or premium which Mercury submitted to or obtained approval from the State Department of Insurance or seeks to enforce any provision of Insurance Code section [1861.01] et seq. (Compare
  
   Walker v. Allstate Indemnity Co.
  
  (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 750 [92 Cal.Rptr.2d 132].) Accordingly, exclusive jurisdiction is not a defense. . . . Indeed,
  
   Walker
  
  recognized the continuing application of the Unfair Competition Law as to insurers except in the area of ratemaking
  
   Walker
  
  at 77 Cal.App.4th 758-759. HD Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Ã¢ÂÂ¢ fiD A review of plaintiff’s Third Amended Complaint discloses the allegations under § 17200 focus on the relationship Mercury producers have with the defendant. It alleges that the defendant has fostered this relationship without complying with § 1704 of the Insurance Code. As a result, Mercury is engaging in unfair, unlawful, and fraudulent business practices. The contentions found to be true by this Court, are not anchored in rates as opposed to relationships that generate the violation of Business and Professions Code § 17200.”
 

  “It is immaterial to Mercury’s liability in this case that it did not actually receive the ‘broker fees.’ Under section 17200, the test of liability is whether Mercury engaged in unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business practices .... Mercury need not directly benefit in order to be held liable under this statute. Nevertheless, there is evidence in the record that even though Mercury did not directly receive the fees, Mercury perceives some business advantage and therefore a benefit in the charging of ‘broker fees’ by its ‘broker’ agents .... Further, Mercury is deemed by operation of law to have constructively received the ‘broker fees.’ . . . The issue of constructive as opposed to actual receipt is more appropriately addressed to the remedial aspect of the case.”
 

  The court thereafter entered a judgment in the form of a permanent injunction prohibiting Mercury from: (1) selling “any policy of personal lines automobile and/or homeowners insurance in California through a broker-agent who has not been appointed an agent” pursuant to section 1704(a) or “through a particular broker-agent [who Mercury knows] has charged or is continuing to charge a broker fee,” and (2) publishing “any advertising
   
   *936
   
  that compares insurance premiums for personal lines automobile and/or homeowner policies without a conspicuous statement . . . that a broker fee may be charged in addition to the premium quoted for the Mercury insurance.” Thereafter the court granted plaintiff’s motion for attorney fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5, and made an order awarding plaintiff $1,172,817.
 

  Mercury filed timely notices of appeal from the judgment and from the fee order.
 

  Both sides have the support of amici curiae on this appeal—the American Agents Alliance for Mercury, and the Commissioner for plaintiff.
 

  REVIEW
 

  I
 

  Several semi-jurisdictional matters require initial comment.
 

  Mercury makes a point of opening its brief with comments that plaintiff never purchased a policy from Mercury and is therefore utterly “disinterested” in the controversy he began. It is well established, however, that a personal stake is not required for standing to prosecute an unfair competition lawsuit on behalf of others: “ ‘[A] private plaintiff who has himself suffered no injury at all may sue to obtain relief for others.’ ”
  
   (Stop Youth Addiction, Inc. v. Lucky Stores, Inc.
  
  (1998) 17 Cal.4th 553, 561 [71 Cal.Rptr.2d 731, 950 P.2d 1086].)
 

  According to Mercury, “the trial court’s conclusion that Mercury ‘constructively received’ illegal broker fees, while incorrect, nonetheless brings this matter within the original and exclusive jurisdiction of the Insurance Commissioner and divests the superior court of any power to grant relief.” Mercury reasons that if the fees charged by its brokers are part of the premium charged customers, the matter comes within the Commissioner’s plenary authority over rates and premiums. We do not see the trial court’s actions as trespassing upon the Commissioner’s jurisdiction.
 

  The elaborate statutory and administrative process for setting rates has “been interpreted to provide exclusive original jurisdiction over issues related to ratemaking to the commissioner.”
  
   (Walker v. Allstate Indemnity Co., supra, 77
  
  Cal.App.4th 750, 755.) The Insurance Code does not, however, displace the UCL “except as to . . . activities related to rate setting.”
  
   (Quelimane Co.
  
  v.
  
   Stewart Title Guaranty Co.
  
  (1998) 19 Cal.4th 26,

  33 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 709, 960 P.2d 513]; see
  
   Walker v. Allstate Indemnity Co., supra,
  
  at p. 759.) What a court held with respect to a federal statute forbidding local action that would “regulate ... the rates charged” by a federally regulated industry is equally valid to the insurance context: “A judicial act constitutes rate regulation only if its principal purpose and direct effect are to control rates. ... In general, a claim that directly challenges a rate and seeks a remedy to limit or control the rate prospectively or retrospectively is an attempt to regulate rates,” but “a claim that directly challenges some other activity,
  
   such as false advertising
  
  ... is not rate regulation.”
  
   (Spielholz v. Superior Court
  
  (2001) 86 Cal.App.4th 1366, 1374—1375 [104 Cal.Rptr.2d 197], italics added.) A claim predicated on a violation of the Insurance Code not related to ratemaking may thus be framed as a claim under the UCL. (See
  
   Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co.
  
  (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 987 [11 Cal.Rptr.3d 45].) This was the approach plaintiff adopted. Mercury was allegedly violating provisions of the Insurance Code regulating brokers, as well as engaging in false advertising. There is consequently no basis for overturning the trial court’s conclusion that “[n]one of plaintiff’s claims challenges any rate or premium which Mercury submitted to or obtained approval from the . . . Department of Insurance.”
 

  Our confidence in this determination is enhanced by the fact that the Commissioner, appearing as amicus curiae, does not agree with Mercury, but has filed a brief supporting plaintiff. The fact that the Commissioner does not view the trial court as having poached into the Commissioner’s statutory domain is clearly significant, and we defer to his interpretation of his authority.

  After briefing was completed, Mercury sent a letter advising us of the recent decision in
  
   Jonathan Neil & Assoc., Inc. v. Jones
  
  (2004) 33 Cal.4th 917 [16 Cal.Rptr.3d 849, 94 P.3d 1055], wherein our Supreme Court discussed the doctrine of “primary jurisdiction.” Mercury states in its letter that “This discussion is relevant to the present appeal because Mercury has argued, both in the trial court [and] in its appellate briefs, that this case should not have been adjudicated in the superior court, but should have been referred to the Insurance Commissioner.” Plaintiff and Mercury then submitted letter briefs on this issue.
 

  Unlike exclusive jurisdiction, primary jurisdiction is not jurisdictional in the sense that courts are utterly without the power to decide, but is a common
   
   *938
   
  law policy advancing comity between courts and administrative agencies. “ 1 “Primary jurisdiction,” . . . applies where a claim is originally cognizable in the courts, and comes into play whenever enforcement of the claim requires the resolution of issues which, under a regulatory scheme, have been placed within the special competence of an administrative body; in such a case the judicial process is suspended pending referral of such issues to the administrative body for its views.’ ”
  
   (Farmers Ins. Exchange v. Superior Court

[Citations.] [][] No rigid formula exists for applying the primary jurisdiction doctrine [citation]. Instead, resolution generally hinges on a court’s determination of the extent to which the policies noted above are implicated in a given case. [Citations.] This discretionary approach leaves courts with considerable flexibility to avoid application of the doctrine in appropriate situations, as required by the interests of justice.”
  
   (Farmers Ins. Exchange v. Superior Court, supra,
  
  at pp. 391-392, fns. omitted.)
 

  Mercury invoked the doctrine of primary jurisdiction before the trial court. Mercury did not, however, claim in its opening brief that the trial court’s decision not to stay judicial proceedings was an abuse of discretion. Mercury did not mention the issue of the Commissioner having primary jurisdiction until it filed its reply brief. Thus, the issue could be treated as waived. (E.g.,
  
   Kahn
  
  v.
  
   Wilson
  
  (1898) 120 Cal. 643, 644 [53 R 24];
  
   Reichardt
  
  v.
  
   Hoffman
  
  (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 754, 764 [60 Cal.Rptr.2d 770]; 9 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (4th ed. 1997) Appeal, § 616, pp. 647-648.)
 

  Assuming the issue was preserved, we conclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion by declining to refer the matter to the Commissioner. First, there is a basis for believing the Commissioner would not have accepted the referral. In July of 2000, when he adopted regulations concerning broker fees (see Cal. Code Regs., tit. 10, §§ 2189.1-2189.8), the Commissioner took the position that “current California case law establishes that the existence of binding authority creates an agency relationship between insurer and producer.
  
   Marsh & McLennan of California v. City of Los Angeles[, supra,]
  
  62 Cal.App.3d 108 [132 Cal.Rptr. 796]. . . .
  
   The issue of what factors, such as binding authority, do or do not establish an agency relationship are better addressed by
  
  the legislature and
  
   the courts.
  
  The Commissioner arguably lacks a legislative delegation to resolve this issue through regulations.” (Ins. Com., Final Statement of Reasons, Cal. Code Regs. tit. 10, § 2189.1 et seq., File No. RH-379 (July 6, 2000), pp. 19-20, italics added.) Second, as plaintiff’s attorney stated in his letter responding to Mercury’s letter: “[T]he
   
   *939
   
  Commissioner . . . has now made his views known to the courts through his amicus curiae brief, stating that he agrees with the findings and conclusions of the Superior Court, with one minor immaterial exception. The amicus curiae brief establishes that even if Mercury had sought a stay based on primary jurisdiction, which of course it did not, there was no error or prejudice to Mercury from the Superior Court’s not having the views of the Department of Insurance before its decision on the merits.” Again, the Commissioner’s silence is eloquent evidence of his belief that he had no administrative expertise to offer the court in resolving the issues generated by this litigation.
  
   (Personal Watercraft Coalition
  
  v.
  
   Marin County Bd. of Supervisors, supra,

   Spanish Speaking Citizens’ Foundation, Inc.
  
  v.
  
   Low, supra,
  
  85 Cal.App.4th 1179, 1214—1215.) For each and all of these reasons, the Commissioner’s primary jurisdiction was not an impediment to the trial court proceeding to adjudicate the issues before it.

  Mercury’s principal contention is that “the dual agency practiced by Mercury and its independent brokers cannot form the basis of UCL liability because it falls within a statutory and regulatory safe harbor.” Mercury is invoking an exception to the UCL that our Supreme Court explained as follows: “Although the unfair competition law’s scope is sweeping, it is not unlimited. Courts may not simply impose their own notions of the day as to what is fair or unfair. Specific legislation may limit the judiciary’s power to declare conduct unfair. If the Legislature has permitted certain conduct or considered a situation and concluded no action should lie, courts may not override that determination. When specific legislation provides a ‘safe harbor,’ plaintiffs may not use the general unfair competition law to assault that harbor.”
  
   (Cel-Tech Communications, Inc.
  
  v.
  
   Los Angeles Cellular Telephone Co.
  
  (1999) 20 Cal.4th 163, 182 [83 Cal.Rptr.2d 548, 973 P.2d 527].) However, the court added a caution: “Acts that the Legislature has determined to be lawful may not form the basis for an action under the unfair competition law, but acts may, if otherwise unfair, be challenged under the unfair competition law even if the Legislature failed to proscribe them in some other provision.”
  
   (Id.
  
  at p. 183.)
 

  Mercury marshals a number of arguments as to why its practices with brokers are proper and should not have been enjoined.
 

  “Proposition 103 altered the way insurance products were delivered to consumers. With all underwriting decisions made in advance under the watchful eyes of the Insurance Commissioner, personal lines insurance became more of a ‘commodity,’ and the functions of the insurance producer became limited primarily to customer service. If an applicant is a ‘good
   
   *940
   
  driver,’ satisfies the insurer’s guidelines, and pays the initial premium, the insurer must automatically accept the risk. The generic nature of this transaction reduced the significance of any distinction between the functions of agents and brokers, [f] Due to mandatory insurance laws ... the marketplace also demanded that all insurance producers have the ability to provide immediate ‘on-the-spot’ insurance coverage to every qualified applicant. Without that ability, producers could not satisfy the needs of car purchasers unable to drive their cars off the lot without insurance. The realities of the changed market are reflected in the post-Proposition 103 amendments to the Insurance Code provisions relating to brokers and agents, which progressively vested brokers with all authority traditionally associated with agents. To the extent that the definitional provisions of the Insurance Code had operational significance, before that significance was eliminated.” Mercury points to the 1990 amendments to sections 1625 and 1732 (see fin. 2 and accompanying text, ante) as having “drained the definitional language of Sections 1621 and 1623 of their operating significance and further codified the dual agency doctrine, reflecting legislative recognition, in the wake of Proposition 103, that brokers were simultaneously performing agency functions beyond those heretofore specifically listed in Insurance Code section 1732 . . . incorporating the broker-agent licensee into its statement of dual agency.” Mercury concludes that “the codification of dual agency in Section 1732, together with the broker’s authority to ‘transact’ insurance conferred by Section 1625 & Section 1625.5, creates an express safe harbor for Mercury’s practices that precludes UCL liability.”
  
   5
  


  Plaintiff responds that section 1704(a) “should not be accorded the toothless interpretation that insurance companies may simply forego appointment with impunity,” but should be construed to impose an affirmative duty on insurers to file appointment notices for any licensee acting as an insurer’s agent. Plaintiff urges us to adopt this bright-line test—“if the licensee acts as an agent for the insurer
  
   in any capacity,
  
  except as expressly allowed by
   
   *941
   
  section 1732, the licensee is an agent and must be appointed.” The Commissioner takes essentially the same view: “[I]f a producer acts on behalf of an insurer
  
   in any way
  
  (except as permitted by section 1732 . . .), then he or she ceases to be a broker, even if the producer mainly acts for the insured.” The “plain meaning of sections 1621 and 1623” is that “a producer is an agent if the producer acts on behalf of an insurer in any way not permitted by section 1732.” If this argument does not succeed, plaintiff’s alternative position is that the judgment may be affirmed because the trial court’s findings of fact support the conclusion that the brokers were Mercury’s de facto agents and therefore subject to the appointment requirement of section 1704(a).
 

  Neither of these arguments is completely persuasive, in large part because each suffers from a common defect. Each selectively emphasizes favorable statutory language in isolation without attempting to fit the language into a coherent reading of all of the statutes in the Insurance Code dealing with the agent-broker issue. Mercury depicts a remorseless march of history away from mutually exclusive concepts of agent and broker, but does not account for the Legislature’s refusal to stop using these terms in new statutes. Plaintiff fears that if Mercury prevails, section 1704(a) will become a dead letter because no insurer will bother to appoint agents, but deal only with brokers for whom the insurer will not be vicariously liable. As a court, however, “we do not construe statutes in isolation, but rather read every statute ‘with reference to the entire scheme of law of which it is part so that the whole may be harmonized and retain effectiveness.’ ”
  
   (People v. Pieters
  
  (1991) 52 Cal.3d 894, 899 [276 Cal.Rptr. 918, 802 P.2d 420].)
 

  Mercury does not establish, as a matter of law that the Legislature expressly created a safe harbor for the practices enjoined by the trial court. True, the Legislature did, following
  
   Maloney,
  
  enact what is now section 1732 to codify acceptance of the concept of dual agency in the insurance field, and in that sense did create an express statutory safe harbor. It did so, however, in a very precise way, going no further than the
  
   Maloney
  
  court—a broker could act as an insurer’s agent, but only to the extent of “collecting and transmitting premium or retum[ing] premium funds and delivering policies and other documents evidencing insurance.” Despite numerous opportunities to do so, the Legislature has never expanded this definition in section 1732.
 

  The 1990 addition of “broker-agent” to section 1625 defining fire and casualty licensee, and to section 1732 broker (see fn. 2,
  
   ante)
  
  does not, at first glance, assist Mercury because neither of these changes suggests that by adding the new term the Legislature intended to make any fundamental alteration of the established distinction between agent and broker. Indeed, the amendment of section 1732 in the same bill would seem to have been premised on maintaining that distinction by addressing the situation where
   
   *942
   
  “[a] person licensed as a fire and casualty broker-agent [who is]
  
   acting as an insurance broker
  
  may act as an insurance agent in collecting and transmitting premium or returning] premium funds and delivering policies and other documents evidencing insurance.” (Italics added.) If, as Mercury argues, the Legislature intended to “drainQ the definitional language of Sections 1621 and 1623 of their operating significance,” this would have been a very oblique way of achieving that goal; a far more logical approach would have been to have amended or repealed the statutes defining agent and broker. (Cf.
  
   Elbert, Ltd. v. Gross
  
  (1953) 41 Cal.2d 322, 330 [260 P.2d 35] [“Had the Legislature intended to create an exception to the statute of limitations, the more logical place to do so would have been in section 75, rather than in section 74, of the act.”].)
 

  The legislative history establishes that the Legislature did indeed intend to amalgamate the categories of broker and agent, at least with respect to personal lines. The Legislative Counsel’s digest for the bill states: “This bill would eliminate insurance agent and insurance broker as categories of licensure, and would instead provide for licensure of fire and casualty insurance broker-agents. . . . Under the bill, fire and casualty broker-agents could be authorized to act as brokers or agents.” (Legis. Counsel’s Dig., Sen. Bill No. 2642 (1989-1990 Reg. Sess.) 5 Stats. 1990, Summary Dig., p. 565.) There are numerous committee reports and analyses that made the same point. (Sen. Com. on Insurance, Claims and Corporations, Rep. on Sen. Bill No. 2642 (1989-1990 Reg. Sess.) as amended Apr. 4, 1990, p. 1 [“SB 2642 does the following: [f] 1) Combines existing licenses: [(J[] a. Property and casualty sales licenses (solicitor, agent & broker) into a broker-agent license”]; Sen. Rules Com., Rep. on Sen. Bill No. 2642 (1989-1990 Reg. Sess.) as amended May 17, 1990, p. 2 [bill would combine “Property and casualty sales licenses (solicitor, agent and broker) into a broker-agent license”]; Assem. Com. on Finance and Insurance, Analysis of Sen. Bill No. 2642 (1998-1990 Reg. Sess.) July 3, 1990, p. 1 [“This bill. . . combines the property casualty licenses into a single license, called the fire and casualty broker/agent license”]; Assem. Com. on Ways and Means, Analysis of Sen. Bill No. 2642 (1998-1990 Reg. Sess.) Aug. 9, 1990, p. 1 [“This bill . . . makes several changes related to the licensure categories, including combining agent and broker license categories”].)
 

  Thus, there is some basis for Mercury to maintain that the changes enacted by the 1990 bill “drained the definitional language of Sections 1621 and 1623 of their operating significance and further codified the dual agency doctrine,” but only as to personal lines handled by a fire and casualty broker-agent. Of greater consequence is the fact that the same bill that inserted “broker-agent” into sections 1625 and 1732 also amended section 1704(a) to read in pertinent part: “Every applicant for a license as a . . . fire and casualty broker-agent to act as an insurance agent . . . shall have filed on his or her
   
   *943
   
  behalf with the commissioner a notice of appointment to act as an agent executed by an insurer, . . . appointing the applicant ... its agent within this state.” (Stats. 1990, ch. 1420, § 38, p. 6457.) Further statutory recognition is found in the subsequent changes to section 769 addressing the grounds for terminating the written contract of a broker-agent with an insurer, and the addition of section 1625.5 authorizing a personal lines agent to become a fire and casualty broker-agent. Each of these statutes must be considered in fight of the others, and harmonized with them.
  
   6
  


  For Mercury, the Legislature, by introducing the term “broker-agent” into a number of statutes (principally sections 769, 1625, and 1625.5), and yet not defining that term, means that the only definition can come from the statutes defining “broker” and “agent.” According to this reasoning, broker-agents can now exercise the powers of brokers and agents that are spelled out in sections 1623 and 1621, respectively, without being subjected to the limitations laid out in those same statutes. If this approach were to be accepted, personal fines broker-agents would in effect be free to exercise all of the powers authorized by those statutes. The limitations imposed by sections 1621 and 1623 would in essence be cancelled and, as applied to personal fines broker-agents, the statutes would become dead letters. We are not persuaded.
 

  Section 1704(a) was the linchpin of the trial court’s decision. The 1990 version clearly stated that an “applicant for a license as ... a fire and casualty broker-agent to act as an insurance agent” must be appointed. The 2002 version, however, changed “fire and casualty broker-agent” to “fire and casualty insurance agents.” Upon examination, however, both versions of section 1704(a) support the judgment entered by the trial court.
 

  The first version was enacted by the same bill whereby the Legislature added the term “broker-agent” to sections 1625 and 1732, the same bill Mercury maintains homogenized the former categories of broker and agent into the new single category of broker-agent. This was only one year after Mercury began converting its agents to brokers. Thus, for more than a decade Mercury was not complying with the plain command of section 1704(a) as it then read, that “[e]very applicant for a license ... as a fire and casualty broker-agent to act as an insurance agent”
  
   shall
  
  be appointed.
 

 
   *944
   
  The 2002 amendment changed the reference from “broker-agent” to “agent.” The legislative history provides no clear reason why this particular change was made. The history demonstrates that the major intention of the bill, which amended, repealed, and added numerous provisions to the Insurance Code, was to avoid federal regulation in the areas of federally chartered depository institutions and reciprocal multistate licensing of producers; there is nothing showing why this precise change was made, and no expressed intent to relieving personal lines broker-agents of the appointment requirement.
  
   7
  
  Because the legislative history is completely silent, there is no reasonable basis for concluding that the Legislature intended that people writing fire and casualty insurance on behalf of insurers, whether called broker-agents or agents, should be exempt from the appointment requirement. (See
  
   People v. Barker
  
  (2004) 34 Cal.4th 345, 356 [18 Cal.Rptr.3d 260].) Certainly, there is no basis for believing that Mercury was anticipating this change, or relying upon it, when it began converting its appointed agents to brokers in 1989.
 

  To be sure, Mercury has presented a convincing argument that the traditional distinction between broker and agent has receded. But it does not follow that broker-agents are exempt from the appointment requirement of section 1704(a). Reading all the statutes together and in light of each other (see
  
   International Business Machines v. State Bd. of Equalization, supra,
  
  26 Cal.3d 923, 932, quoted at fn. 6,
  
   ante)
  
  it appears that in this area the terms have become interchangeable. Brokers can exercise the traditional functions of agents, and vice versa. Having already enacted in the 1990 version of
   
   *945
   
  section 1704(a) that every “broker-agent” must be appointed, and there being no indication that the Legislature meant to relax this requirement, the 2002 amendment of section 1704(a) can be read as simply a reformulation of the appointment requirement. What had been explicit in the 1990 version was now implicit; “agent” was now used as shorthand for “broker-agent.” Another provision of section 1704 demonstrates this point.
 

  The 2002 version did not amend that portion of section 1704(a) which provides that a notice of appointment will remain valid until “[t]he filing of a notice of termination by the insurer ... or by the appointed . . . fire and casualty broker-agent . . . .” (§ 1704, subd. (a)(2).) If the Commissioner must be notified that a broker-agent’s appointment for an insurer is terminated, it logically follows that the Commissioner must be notified when the broker-agent is first appointed by an insurer, and—as noted by the trial court—by which insurer. There would be no point to the Legislature not requiring broker-agents to be appointed, but then in the same statute specifying the circumstances when that nonexistent appointment would end. Statutorily, “broker-agent” is therefore the same as “agent” for purposes of section 1704(a).
 

  Notwithstanding the 2002 change to section 1704(a), there are a number of other statutes showing that a fire and casualty broker-agent is still treated as an agent and is therefore subject to the appointment requirement. For example, a broker-agent can be an insurer’s “general agent” who, pursuant to a written contract “has the power to (1) appoint, supervise, and terminate local agents, (2) accept or decline risks, and (3) collect premium money from producing broker-agents.” (§ 769.55.) “[A]n insurer may own or control, whether directly or indirectly, a separate entity licensed ... as a fire and casualty broker-agent .... Insurance transacted by a fire and casualty broker-agent with and on behalf of the owning or controlling insurer shall be in its capacity as an insurance agent.” (§ 1649.5.) The same is true if the broker-agent is the insurer’s managing general agent. (§ 1735.) None of these statutes expressly indicate these are agents who are exempt from the appointment requirement.
 

  Mercury and amicus curiae American Agents Alliance have devoted considerable time and attention to explaining the numerous and valuable services broker-agents can and do provide in securing automobile insurance for the public. This may be conceded, but it is not relevant. What is relevant is what the statutes say and whether what they say establishes a safe harbor protecting Mercury from UCL liability. Until the Legislature makes an express statutory declaration to the contrary, we cannot hold that Mercury enjoys a safe harbor from the requirement that its broker-agents must be appointed in accordance with section 1704(a).
  
   (Cel-Tech Communications, Inc. v. Los Angeles Cellular Telephone Co, supra,
  
  20 Cal.4th 163, 182-184.)
 

 
   *946

  Mercury next contends that its advertising “likewise falls within a safe harbor that precludes UCL liability.” It bases this claim upon the broker’s fees regulations promulgated by the Commissioner in 1998. As has already been established, administrative regulations are insufficient to create a safe harbor from UCL liability. (See fn. 5,
  
   ante.)
  
  Mercury argues “there is little or no precedent” for making Mercury vicariously responsible for charges added by “third party” broker-agents to the premiums charged by Mercury. This overlooks the extensive findings made by the trial court— findings which Mercury does not challenge—detailing the relationship between Mercury and its ostensible “brokers.” Mercury “has cultivated stable, long-term relationships with its ‘brokers,’ ” none of whom objected when Mercury “converted” them from appointed agents to brokers. The broker contracts recite that the broker will “represent” Mercury, which “knowingly permits . . . ‘brokers’ to advertise to the public that they ‘represent’ Mercury.” Advertising by brokers is approved by Mercury, which allows brokers to use Mercury’s name and logo. Mercury sends “representatives who periodically visit, monitor and supervise . . . brokers on behalf of Mercury” to ensure “compliance with Mercury’s rules and regulations, the professionalism of their agencies, and their compliance with law.” Mercury lists the brokers on its Internet Web site, allows them to participate in Mercury’s direct mail campaigns, and is aware that the comparison rate advertising it directs may be misleading in that customers are not told that brokers fees will be added. In light of all these findings, the trial court also found that “Mercury has exercised and exercises substantial control over its independent producers . . . in structuring and administering its relationships with them.” These undisputed findings are sufficient to establish that the brokers are the ostensible agents of Mercury (Civ. Code, §§ 2298, 2300, 2315, 2317) and Mercury is therefore vicariously responsible for them. (Civ. Code, § 2338;
  
   Flippo Industries, Inc. v. Sun Ins. Co.
  
  (1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 1429, 1442 [88 Cal.Rptr.2d 881];
  
   Alhino v. Starr
  
  (1980) 112 Cal.App.3d 158, 174 [169 Cal.Rptr. 136].)
 

  The trial court concluded from the findings that injunctive relief was required to halt Mercury’s “ongoing violations,” including its “false advertising.” Its decision to issue the permanent injunction to halt these practices will be overturned only if we are compelled to conclude that the remedy amounts to an abuse of discretion. (E.g.,
  
   Union Interchange, Inc. v. Savage
  
  (1959) 52 Cal.2d 601, 606 [342 P.2d 249];
  
   Shapiro v. San Diego City Council
  
  (2002) 96 Cal.App.4th 904, 912 [117 Cal.Rptr.2d 631].) We find no abuse.

  In their application for attorney fees, plaintiff’s attorneys submitted that $781,878 was a fair lodestar figure for the reasonable value of their services,
   
   *947
   
  and should be increased by a multiplier of two. The court found that the lodestar fees were reasonable and should be increased by a multiplier of 1.5, for an award of $1,172,817.
 

  Employing less than two pages in its brief, Mercury’s final argument is that this award “should be vacated, reduced or remanded.” Mercury submits that because plaintiff began by seeking restitution but ended up with only injunctive relief that is “technical in nature and confers virtually no benefits on consumers. Without a restitution award, this case should be considered a failure for Plaintiff’s attorneys. ...[!]... Based on the results of this litigation, if any multiplier should have been applied to Plaintiff’s lodestar, it should have been reduced rather than increased. A positive multiplier is not supported by the evidence, considering the lack of Plaintiff’s success in accomplishing the primary objective of the lawsuit.”
 

  It is true that plaintiff originally sought restitution and did so up to the entry of judgment. The court rejected the plaintiff’s proposal “to take discovery for a period of three months from the Mercury brokers to discover which ones have charged broker fees and to scale this problem into a factual context rather than dealing with it as it is now where we don’t really know what’s involved administratively or managerially with the mechanics of restitution.” Nevertheless, plaintiff did achieve a significant objective of the lawsuit—halting Mercury’s placing of insurance through brokers who were not appointed agents.
 

  “There is no hard-and-fast rule limiting the factors that may justify an exercise of judicial discretion to increase or decrease a lodestar calculation.” (Th
  
   ayer v. Wells Fargo Bank
  
  (2001) 92 Cal.App.4th 819, 834 [112 Cal.Rptr.2d 284].) There are numerous such factors, and their evaluation is entrusted to a trial court’s sound discretion; any one of those factors may be responsible for enhancing or reducing the lodestar. (E.g.,
  
   Ketchum v. Moses
  
  (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1132, 1134, 1138 [104 Cal.Rptr.2d 377, 17 P.3d 735]; see also

  v.
  
   Oso Valley Greenbelt Assn.
  
  (2001) 92 Cal.App.4th 156, 161 [111 Cal.Rptr.2d 636].) Mercury, however, is seeking to elevate one factor above all others. Mercury makes no attempt to challenge the trial court’s findings that the litigation initiated by plaintiff “enforced an important right affecting the public interest” and “conferred a significant benefit upon ... a large class of persons.” Nor does it contest other findings that the hours claimed were reasonable, as were the hourly rates charged by plaintiff’s attorneys. The trial court may have taken account of plaintiff’s incomplete success when it reduced the multiplier requested by plaintiff; such an approach was court approved by this court in

  (1991) 235 Cal.App.3d 1407, 1418-1419 [1 Cal.Rptr.2d 459], a decision that was repeatedly cited by plaintiff in its fee application. Accordingly, Mercury

  has not demonstrated that the trial court abused its discretion in fixing the amount of plaintiff’s award.

   These provisions now read: “A fire and casualty licensee is a person authorized to act as an insurance agent, broker, or solicitor, and a fire and casualty broker-agent license is a license so to act.” (§ 1625.)

   In Mercury’s original version of the bill, the presumption was conclusive.
  


   4
  

   “Producer” is not a statutory term, but appears to be a term of art in the insurance industry referring to persons or firms who “produce”—that is, generate or obtain—business for insurers. (See
   
    Osborn
   
   v.
   
    Ozlin
   
   (1940) 310 U.S. 53, 60-61 [84 L.Ed. 1074, 60 S.Ct. 758].) For our purposes, it means brokers and agents.
  


   5
  

   Mercury includes in its discussion the regulations on “broker fees” promulgated by the Commissioner in 1998 (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 10, §§ 2189.1-2189.8) and two advisory letters written by a staff attorney in the Department of Insurance. These materials are not germane to our analysis because our Supreme Court has held that only statutes can create a safe harbor. (See
   
    Cel-Tech Communications, Inc. v. Los Angeles Cellular Telephone Co., supra, 20
   
   Cal.4th 163, 182-184.)
  

   Mercury also argues that its “marketing practices fall within an implied safe harbor because the overall statutory scheme acknowledges the existence of the broker market as currently structured.” However, a safe harbor statute must explicitly prohibit liability for the defendant’s acts or omissions. (See
   
    Cel-Tech Communications, Inc. v. Los Angeles Cellular Telephone Co., supra,
   
   20 Cal.4th at p. 184 [“the unfair competition law does not permit an action that another statute expressly precludes, ffl Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Ã¢ÂÂ¢ [A] plaintiff may not bring an action under the unfair competition law if some other provision bars it. That other provision must actually bar it, however, and not merely fail to allow it.”].) Mercury’s argument that it should be protected by an implied safe harbor is contrary to the approach adopted by our Supreme Court.

   “It is . . . ‘an established rule of statutory construction that similar statutes should be construed in light of one another .... “[Application of the rule that statutes in pari materia should be construed together is most justified, and light from that source has the greatest probative force, in the case of statutes relating to the same subject matter that were passed at the same session of the legislature, especially if they were passed or approved or take effect on the same day ....”’ [Citation.] When as in the present case both statutes are part of the same bill, enacted and chaptered together, the rule requiring the courts to reconcile the statutes is even more compelling . . . .”

   The Legislature stated its reasons for enacting the bill in these findings: “(a) Pursuant to the federal government’s Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999 (the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act), the Comptroller of the Currency, the Office of Thrift Supervision, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Bank adopted joint consumer protection regulations. In order for California to retain jurisdiction to regulate the insurance sales practices of depository institutions, or persons who are engaged in those activities at an office of a depository institution or on behalf of a depository institution, California law must have similar or stronger consumer protections than those of the four federal agencies. Consequently, it is necessary to add language to the Insurance Code to provide California with consumer protection laws that are uniform with the federal regulations.
  

   “(b) The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act authorizes the establishment of a new organization named the National Association of Registered Agents and Brokers (NARAB). NARAB comes into existence if 29 state and territory insurance regulators do not implement uniform or reciprocal laws for the licensing of nonresident insurance producers by November 2002. NARAB would establish uniform producer licensing laws and provide a mechanism for multistate licensing of insurance producers, thereby preempting state-unique licensing procedures and qualifications. In an effort to avoid the creation of NARAB and preserve state regulation of producer licensing, California should amend the Insurance Code as necessary to create reciprocal licensing laws.” (Stats. 2002, ch. 203, § 1.) A number of legislative committee reports and analyses never discuss precisely why the amendment of section 1704(a) was related to either the practices of federally chartered depository institutions or creating reciprocal licensing laws.

687323,687323,849567,United States v. Lester W. Gilbert,"UNITED STATES of America, Plaintiff-Appellee, v. Lester W. GILBERT, Defendant-Appellant","

  FLAUM, Circuit Judge.
 

  Lester Gilbert pled guilty to one count of unlawful possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1). The district court sentenced him to 188 months in prison. On appeal Gilbert presents two arguments. First, he asserts that the seizure of the firearm was pursuant to an illegal arrest and thus should have been suppressed. Second, Gilbert contends that the district court wrongly sentenced him under the Armed Career Criminal Act and under the Sentencing Guidelines. We hold that the district court properly denied Gilbert’s motion to suppress and properly sentenced him. We thus affirm.
 

  I.
 

  In October, 1993, Champaign County Sheriff Investigator Scott Swan arrested Cecil Relation on an outstanding burglary warrant. In exchange for a promise of leniency in connection with pending burglary charges, Relation provided Swan with information regarding approximately fifteen to twenty burglaries in the Champaign County area. Specifically, Relation told Swan that he had committed the burglaries with his three roommates: Lester Gilbert, Ernesto Gonzales, and Kathy O’Malley. Relation supplied Swan with detailed information about the burglaries, including their locations, the methods by which they were accomplished, the vehicles used, and the items taken. Relation additionally informed Swan that Gilbert and Gonzales had met in the Pontiac penitentiary when they were inmates in the same cellbloek and had used and sold heroin. Relation also told Swan that Gilbert carried a handgun. Relation described the gun as a semi-automatic Colt with pearl handgrips. After receiving this information, Swan verified it and found all of the details to be accurate.
 

  Relation informed Swan that Gilbert, O’Malley and Gonzales were contemplating an armed robbery of an Arby’s restaurant. Relation agreed to help Swan and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (“ATF”)
   
   *1165
   
  Agent Paul Vido catch Gilbert. At approximately 10:30 a.m. on November 2, 1993, Swan and other officers staked out Gilbert’s residence. Around noon, Swan observed Relation and O’Malley leave the residence in a car. Relation and O’Malley drove to a nearby grocery store and paged Swan from there, an arrangement upon which Swan and Relation had previously agreed. Relation informed Swan that Gilbert and Gonzales would soon be leaving the residence in a blue station wagon to purchase drugs. Relation returned to the residence.
 

  At about 1:10 p.m., Gilbert and Gonzales exited the house and drove away in a blue station wagon. Swan could not observe whether Gilbert was carrying a gun. Swan did not follow the station wagon because he was waiting for a call from Relation. At 2:40 p.m., Relation, O’Malley and an unidentified woman left the house again. Relation contacted Swan and told Swan that Gilbert was carrying the handgun in a shoulder holster and would be returning to the residence shortly. Five minutes later, Swan spotted Gonzales driving the ear with Gilbert in the passenger seat. Swan followed the vehicle and turned on his red police fight. Gonzales pulled into the driveway of the residence.
  
   1
  
  The district court found:
 

  Swan pulled up parallel to the passenger side, opened his door, pointed his firearm at the defendant, and said, “Lester, put your hands on the dashboard.” Investigator Bolt drew up on the other side within about 10 seconds time and pointed his firearm at Gonzales. It is not clear what the defendant did. He apparently did not put his hands on the dashboard, but he did not do anything else either. Within a very brief period of time, Swan had opened the passenger door, seized the defendant by the collar, and hauled the defendant out onto the ground. In the process of that maneuver, Swan had a clear view of the firearm in a shoulder holster carried by the defendant.
 

  Gonzales was found to be carrying 13.2 grams of cocaine.
 

  Gilbert was indicted on January 5, 1994, for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1).
  
   2
  
  On February 4, 1994, Gilbert filed a motion to suppress evidence of the firearm seized on the day of his arrest. After hearing evidence, the district court denied Gilbert’s motion. On March 2, 1994, Gilbert entered a guilty plea, contingent on his right to appeal the denial of his motion to suppress, in accordance with Rule 11(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Gilbert’s sentencing hearing was held on July 15, 1994. In an Order of Final Disposition entered on July 19, 1994, the district court sentenced Gilbert to a prison term of 188 months, ruling that Gilbert was eligible for sentencing under the armed career criminal provisions of 18 U.S.C. § 924(e), because he had four previous violent felony convictions. This appeal followed.
 

  II.
 

  Gilbert first argues that the district court erred in its denial of his motion to suppress the evidence of the handgun. Gilbert contends that Swan’s apprehension of Gilbert was an illegal warrantless arrest and that the seized handgun, the fruit of that arrest, should not have been considered.

  We review a district court’s ruling on a motion to suppress evidence for clear error.
  
   United States v. Evans,
  
  27 F.3d 1219, 1228 (7th Cir.1994);
  
   United States v. Tilmon,
  
  19 F.3d 1221, 1224 (7th Cir.1994). “A finding is clearly erroneous when, although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.”

   United States v. Rice,
  
  995 F.2d 719, 722 (7th Cir.1993)).
 

  In order to make an arrest without a warrant, the police must have probable cause, under the totality of the circumstances, to reasonably believe that a particular individual has committed a crime.
  
   See Evans,
  
  27 F.3d at 1228. The sole thrust of Gilbert’s argument is that the police lacked probable cause to arrest him for possession of a weapon by a felon. The determination of probable cause involves “a practical, common-sense decision whether, given all of the circumstances set forth ... there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in particular place.”
  
   Illinois v. Gates,

   cert. denied,
  
  — U.S. -, 114 S.Ct. 1414, 128 L.Ed.2d 85 (1994). While probable cause requires more than the mere suspicion, we do not require it to reach the level of virtual certainty.
  
   See Gates,
  
  462 U.S. at 244 n. 13, 103 S.Ct. 2335 n. 13 (“probable cause requires only a probability or substantial chance of criminal activity, not an actual showing of such activity”);

  — U.S. -, 113 S.Ct. 357, 121 L.Ed.2d 270 (1992).
 

  In examining the conduct of investigating police officers, we have held that “[pjoliee officers have probable cause to make an arrest where ‘the fact and circumstances within their knowledge and of which they [have] reasonably trustworthy information [are] sufficient to warrant a prudent man in believing that the [suspect] had committed or was committing an offense.’ ”
  
   Levy,
  
  990 F.2d at 973 (quoting
  
   Beck v. Ohio,
  
  379 U.S. 89, 91, 85 S.Ct. 223, 225, 13 L.Ed.2d 142 (1964)). “Trustworthy information” can include a tip from an informant, as long as the tip is reliable.
  
   See Gates,
  
  462 U.S. at 238, 103 S.Ct. at 2332;
  
   United States v. Scott,

   cert. denied,
  
  — U.S. -, 115 S.Ct. 163, 130 L.Ed.2d 101 (1994). Reliability may be shown by the informant’s past record of reliability, through independent confirmation or personal observation by the police, or by other methods.
  
   See Alabama v. White,
  
  496 U.S. 325, 110 S.Ct. 2412, 110 L.Ed.2d 301 (1990).
 

  In the instant ease, the district court did not clearly err when it concluded that “Officer Swan had a substantial basis for concluding that probable cause existed that the defendant was committing a crime.” Swan had reasonably trustworthy information that the defendant was involved in criminal activity. Relation reliably informed Swan that Gilbert was carrying a handgun and that the defendant was a convicted felon. Moreover, for each piece of information which Relation provided, Swan either independently verified it or confirmed that Relation had first-hand knowledge of its accuracy.
 

  First, Relation gave a detailed description of the gun to Swan as a Colt semi-automatic handgun with pearl handgrips. Relation was able to accurately identify the weapon because he lived in the same house with and had been shown the weapon by Gilbert. Relation also described the blue station wagon in which Gilbert would be travelling and Swan verified that a car matching that description was registered to a resident of the house in which Gilbert lived.
 

  Furthermore, Relation provided Swan with detailed, accurate information of about 15 to 20 burglaries in the surrounding area in which Gilbert was involved. These details included: the location of the burglaries (including which building or business, and the address), how the burglars entered the dwellings, and what they stole. Swan was able to verify the details — some of which were not public information — with other local law enforcement officials.
 

  Swan also had a reliable basis to believe that Gilbert was a convicted felon. Relation informed Swan that Gonzales and Gilbert had met while inmates together at Pontiac Penitentiary and had dealt and used narcotics. Swan contacted the penitentiary and confirmed that they indeed had lived together in the same cellbloek. Swan also investigated Gilbert’s criminal history and discovered that Gilbert had seven prior burglary convictions,
   
   *1167
   
  that he had been committed to the custody of the Illinois Department of Corrections, and that he was on parole at the time of the November, 1993 investigation.
 

  In addition to providing information about past crimes and current actions, Relation accurately predicted Gilbert’s future activities. Around noon on November 2, 1994, Relation informed Swan that Gilbert was carrying the gun in a shoulder holster and that he would be leaving the residence soon in a blue station wagon with Gonzales. Swan confirmed this information from his stakeout location. Later that day, Relation again contacted Swan and informed him that Gonzales and Gilbert would be returning shortly to the residence in the blue station wagon. Five minutes later, Swan observed Gilbert and Gonzales return to the residence in that vehicle.
 

  Gilbert argues that the facts in the instant case are similar to those in
  
   United States v. Mendonsa,
  
  in which the Ninth Circuit held that under the totality of the circumstances, the district court had erred in not suppressing the evidence. 989 F.2d 366 (9th Cir.1993). In
  
   Mendonsa,
  
  the police received an anonymous telephone tip to their local “Crime Stoppers” system from an individual who purportedly had witnessed the sale of marijuana at a certain house. The tipster described the house, its occupants, and the quantity of marijuana. The police later verified that the suspect lived in the house and was on parole for an armed robbery conviction. Based on these facts, the police obtained a search warrant, searched the suspect’s house and seized drugs and a gun. In reviewing the conviction, the Ninth Circuit held that the police lacked probable cause to issue a search warrant. The court concluded that an anonymous tip, with little more, does not constitute probable cause.
  
   Id.
  
  at 368. Furthermore, the court emphasized that the police detective merely verified innocent facts and did not predict any significant future activity.
  
   Id.
  
  at 369.
 


   Mendonsa
  
  is easily distinguishable from the instant case. First, unlike the tipster in
  
   Mendonsa,
  
  Relation was not an anonymous informant. To the contrary, Relation was working with the police on an ongoing investigation. While the police had no means by which to verify the reliability of the tipster’s information about past drug sales in
  
   Men-donsa,
  
  Relation repeatedly established his veracity and accuracy. Second, while the informant in
  
   Mendonsa
  
  had merely happened upon the drug sale, Relation had an established relationship with Gilbert; in fact, Relation lived with Gilbert throughout the investigation and until the arrest. Third, unlike the tipster in
  
   Mendonsa,
  
  Relation predicted the future activities of Gilbert. Relation told Swan about all of Gilbert’s actions on the day of the arrest, including a detailed description of the gun and its location on Gilbert’s body.
 

  The combination of all of the above factors gave Swan probable cause to arrest Gilbert. The police had “more than a mere suspicion that Gilbert was involved in criminal activity.”
  
   Foxworth,
  
  8 F.3d at 543;
  
   see also United States v. Decoteau,
  
  932 F.2d 1205, 1207 (7th Cir.1991). Swan verified each piece of information provided by Relation. Furthermore, “the informant spoke from firsthand observation providing very specific and detailed information ...”
  
   United States v. Fairchild,
  
  940 F.2d 261, 265 (7th Cir.1991). The mere fact Relation had made a deal with the police does not undermine his reliability, especially in light of Swan’s confirmation of the information and the fact that Relation implicated himself as well as Gilbert in the prior burglaries. Since probable cause existed to make the warrantless arrest, the Fourth Amendment was not violated.
 

  III.
 

  Gilbert also challenges the calculation of his sentence under the Sentencing Guidelines. In sentencing him, the district court determined that the base offense level for the substantive crime was 14. It enhanced the sentence by 4 points for possession of a firearm in connection with a drug offense and reduced the sentence by 3 points for acceptance of responsibility, resulting in an offense level of 15. The district court also applied Chapter 4 of the Sentencing Guidelines concerning criminal history and criminal livelihood. Because Gilbert had 3 previous convictions for violent felonies, his conviction for
   
   *1168
   
  possession of a firearm required that he be given an enhanced sentence under the Armed Career Criminal Act (“ACCA”). 18 U.S.C. § 924(e). The district court concluded that that status, combined with Gilbert’s use of a firearm in connection with a controlled substance offense, less a 3 point reduction for acceptance of responsibility, resulted in an offense level of 31, and a category VI criminal history. U.S.S.G. § 4B1.4(b). The court imposed a sentence of 188 months in prison — the lowest sentence within the guideline range.
 

  Gilbert challenges this sentence on two grounds. He first contends that the district court erred in sentencing him under the ACCA. Second, Gilbert maintains that the district court erroneously found that he possessed a gun in connection with a drug offense. We review the district court’s findings of fact only for clear error,
  
   United States v. McGill,
  
  32 F.3d 1138, 1143 (7th Cir.1994) (citing 18 U.S.C. § 3742(e));
  
   United States v. Atkinson,
  
  979 F.2d 1219, 1222 (7th Cir.1992), and the court’s legal determinations
  
   de novo. United States v. Lacour,
  
  32 F.3d 1157, 1159 (7th Cir.1994);
  
   United States v. Prevatte,
  
  16 F.3d 767, 779 (7th Cir.1994).
 

  A.
 

  Gilbert first argues that he was not eligible for sentence enhancement under the ACCA because he only had two — and not three or more — prior violent felony convictions.
  
   4
  
  Under the ACCA, “a thrice convicted felon, who is subsequently convicted for the unlawful possession of a firearm, is subject to a mandatory sentence of not less than fifteen years provided that the three prior convictions resulted from acts
  
   ‘committed on occasions different from one another....’” United States v. Hudspeth,
  
  42 F.3d 1015, 1019 (1994) (en banc) (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(1)). In
  
   Hudspeth
  
  this Court recently reexamined the ACCA’s “committed on occasions different from one another” language of § 924(e)(1). Relying on our circuit precedent in
  
   United States v. Schieman,
  
  894 F.2d 909, 911 (7th Cir.),
  
   cert. denied,
  
  498 U.S. 856, 111 S.Ct. 155, 112 L.Ed.2d 121 (1990) and
  
   United States v. Godinez,
  
  998 F.2d 471 (7th Cir.1993), a divided en banc court concluded that we look “to the nature of the crimes, the identities of the victims, and the locations.”
  
   Hudspeth,
  
  42 F.3d at 1019. In addition to these considerations, the court emphasized the importance of examining whether “the perpetrator had the opportunity to cease and desist from his criminal actions at any time.”
  
   Id.
  


  ""In the case of a person who violates section 922(g) of this title and has three previous convictions by any court ... for a violent felony or a serious drug offense, or both, committed on occasions different from one another, such person shall be fined not more than $25,000 and imprisoned not less than fifteen years.”
 

  Gilbert was convicted of a burglary in 1978. In addition, in two separate trials in 1972, Gilbert was convicted of burglarizing five public school buildings over a three day period. Each burglary involved separate schools, different victims, and distinct locations. Gilbert asserts that the 1972 burglary convictions constitute only one violent felony for the purposes of § 924(e), thus leaving him ineligible for the enhanced sentence under the ACCA because he has only two (1972 and 1978) violent felony convictions.
 

  This argument fails, however, in light of the plain language of § 924(e)(1) and our decision in
  
   Hudspeth.
  
  First, Gilbert’s acts were clearly committed on “occasions different from one another.” Furthermore, in
  
   Hudspeth,
  
  the court held that the defendant had three convictions because he had “committed three distinct burglaries against three separate victims ... in three separate locations over the course of more than thirty minutes.”
  
   Hudspeth,
  
  42 F.3d at 1021. Likewise, Gilbert’s 1972 burglaries did not occur during a single episode or simultaneously. Rather, they occurred over a three day period at separate locations. Moreover, different people were the victims of each burglary. Gilbert’s transgressions were even more clearly three separate crimes against three separate victims at three separate locations than those of the defendant in
  
   Hudspeth,
  
  in which the defendant broke into a shopping mall and burglarized three adjacent, yet separate stores in under an hour. Gilbert is
   
   *1169
   
  precisely the “defendant who has the opportunity to cease and desist or withdraw from his criminal activity at any time, hut who chooses to commit additional crimes [and thus] deserves harsher punishment ...”
  
   Hudspeth,
  
  42 F.3d at 1021.
 

  B.
 

  Gilbert next argues that the district court improperly enhanced his sentence by finding that he possessed a firearm in connection with a drug offense under U.S.S.G. § 4B1.4(b)(3)(A). The district court found Gilbert eligible for sentencing under the ACCA and gave him an offense level of 34, which the court reduced to 31 for acceptance of responsibility.
 

  Section 4B1.4(b)(3)(A) states that a defendant can be sentenced as an armed career criminal with an offense level of 34 “if the defendant used or possessed the firearm or ammunition in connection with a crime of violence or controlled substance offense, as defined in § 4B1.2(1)_” The Guidelines define “controlled substance offense” as “an offense ... prohibiting the manufacture, import, export, distribution or dispensing of a controlled substance (or a counterfeit substance) or the possession of a controlled substance (or a counterfeit substance) with intent to manufacture, import, export, distribute or dispense.” U.S.S.G. § 4B1.2(2). The commentary to this section further provides that “ ‘controlled substance offense’ includes the offenses of aiding and abetting, conspiring, and attempting to commit such offenses.” U.S.S.G. § 4B1.2, comment, (n. 1); see
  
   also United States v. Linnear,
  
  40 F.3d 215 (7th Cir.1994);
  
   United States v. Damerville,
  
  27 F.3d 254, 256 (7th Cir.),
  
   cert. denied,
  
  - U.S. -, 115 S.Ct. 445, 130 L.Ed.2d 355 (1994).
 

  The district court found that Gilbert “did make subsequent statements to ATF agents concerning his knowledge about the presence of cocaine. He also made statements that he possessed the weapon for his protection in cocaine trafficking.” For these reasons, the court concluded that Gilbert possessed the firearm in connection with a narcotics offense.
 

  We review a district court’s application of a sentencing enhancement under U.S.S.G. § 4B1.4(b)(3)(A) for clear error.
  
   United States v. Skinner,
  
  986 F.2d 1091, 1095 (7th Cir.1993). Because the finding of possession of a gun in connection with a drug trafficking offense involves a “mixed” question of fact and law, Gilbert has the burden of demonstrating that it was clearly erroneous. Given'this highly deferential standard, “where there are two permissible views of evidence, the factfinder’s choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous.”
  
   Anderson v. City of Bessemer City,
  
  470 U.S. 564, 574, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 1511, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985);
  
   Skinner,
  
  986 F.2d at 1095. Under this standard, we will only upset the district court’s findings if, after reviewing the “entire evidence,” we are “left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.”
  
   United States v. United States Gypsum Co.,
  
  333 U.S. 364, 395, 68 S.Ct. 525, 542, 92 L.Ed. 746 (1948).
 

  While we may have decided the case differently, we cannot conclude that the district court clearly erred in its findings.
  
   See Anderson,
  
  470 U.S. at 573, 105 S.Ct. at 1511 (the clearly erroneous standard “plainly does not entitle a reviewing court to reverse the trier of fact simply because it is convinced that it would have decided the case different”). First, at the time of his arrest, Gilbert was travelling in the same car with Gonzales, who possessed 13.2 grams of cocaine. Second, Gilbert explained to Chris Bolt, an investigator with the Champaign County Sheriffs Department that he carried a gun because the cocaine trade was dangerous. Specifically, during the sentencing hearing, Bolt testified that the defendant stated that he possessed the firearm because: “the cocaine trade was rather rough and that he had encountered two occasions where he had been shot at. He also told us that he had made — that he was making three or four trips a week to Chicago to purchase one to two ounces of cocaine.” Special Agent Fritz-sche of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms testified that Gilbert carried the firearm for protection, in part for “when he went [to Chicago] to get cocaine and marijuana.” Third, the quantity of cocaine, 13.2 grams, suggests that the drugs were for resale, not personal use. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, Relations specifically
   
   *1170
   
  informed Swan before the arrest that Gilbert and Gonzales would be leaving the house to purchase drugs.
 

  In light of this evidence, it is at least plausible that Gilbert and Gonzales left the house to purchase drugs, returned with 13.2 grams of cocaine, and that Gilbert carried his gun for protection during the purchase.
  
   See Anderson,
  
  470 U.S. at 573-74, 105 S.Ct. at 1511 (“If the district court’s account of the evidence is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety, the court of appeals may not reverse it-”). Consequently, since we are not left with a firm and definite conviction that error has been committed, we affirm the district court’s finding that Gilbert possessed a gun in connection with a narcotics offense.
 

  For the foregoing reasons, the district court’s ruling on the motion to suppress and its sentencing is Affirmed.

  OPINION AND ORDER
 

  THEIS, District Judge.
 

  Jarndyce and Jarndyce drones on. This scarecrow of a suit has, in course of time, become so complicated that no man alive knows what it means. The parties to it understand it least; but it has been observed that no two Chancery lawyers can talk about it for five minutes without coming to a total disagreement as to all the premises. Innumerable children have been born into the cause; innumerable young people have married into it; innumerable old people have died out of it. Scores of persons have deliriously found themselves made parties in Jarndyce and Jarndyce, without knowing how or why; whole families have inherited legendary hatreds with the suit. The little plaintiff or defendant, who was promised a new rocking-horse when Jarndyce and Jarndyce should be settled, has grown up, possessed himself of a real horse, and trotted away into the other world. Fair wards of court have faded into mothers and grandmothers; a long procession of Chancellors has come in and gone out; the legion of bills in the suit have been transformed into mere bills of mortality; there are not three Jamdyces left upon the earth perhaps, since old Tom Jarndyce in despair blew his brains out at a coffee-house in Chancery Lane; but Jarndyce and Jarndyce still drags its dreary length before the Court, perennially hopeless.

  I. HISTORY OF THE LITIGATION
 

  In 1908, the predecessor of American Salt began a salt production operation southeast of Lyons, Rice County, Kansas. Salt production has continued at that location continuously since. Also beginning in 1908, commensurate with the salt production, highly concentrated brine began running “off conveyor belts, elevator buckets and through slats in drying room floors. It ponds on the surface at the southeast corner of the plant. This brine also runs off the property along the Frisco railroad to the county road east of the plant.” Defendants’ Trial Exhibit A. This, too, has apparently continued in varying degrees and fashions ever since. By as early as 1927, a neighboring landowner began finding his underground water supply contaminated with chlorides from the brine, and was forced to haul domestic water to his house.
 

  The pollution continued. The Kansas Board of Health became involved in 1933. In the next year, neighboring farmers hired an attorney who protested to the American Salt plant concerning the injury from the salt runoff, and demanded damages. The salt company demurred, claiming that the pollution was not solely its fault, and detailed to the farmers the plant’s new pollution control improvements that would cure any pollution problems then in existence. The year was 1935.
 

  The pollution continued. Complaints continued. More state investigations were conducted. The salt plant, in conjunction with the state Board of Health, continued to make “antipollution improvements.” The farmers bore children, raised them to adulthood, and died. Their children took over the farming operations. Land was sold, or inherited by new generations. General Host Corporation acquired Cudahy Company, including its American Salt Division. The Board of Health’s responsibilities for this problem were assumed by the Kansas Department of Health and Environment [KDHE], Irrigation plans were abandoned. Suits were threatened. The pollution continued.
 

  This Dickensian matter was brought to this Court when a complaint was filed on
   
   *320
   
  May 31, 1977. Discovery proceeded in a most unusual and contentious manner, and a pretrial order was finally filed on March 9,1982. Defendants then filed an extremely lengthy motion for partial summary judgment on November 2, 1982, the general thrust of which was that the suit was barred by the statute of limitations. Defendants argued that since they had been polluting the underground aquifer for so long, it was no longer actionable: they had in essence acquired a license to pollute based on long-standing habit. After being deluged with heavy briefing by both sides, this Court squarely rejected defendants’ “prescription by pollution” theory, and held that the continuing nature of the pollution emanating from the plant was sufficient to categorize it as a continuing nuisance causing temporary damages, giving rise to a continuing series of causes of action.
  
   Miller v. Cudahy Co.,
  
  567 F.Supp. 892 (D.Kan.1983).
 

  The matter was called for a bench trial on March 26, 1984, and concluded on May 15. This Court handed down its opinion in the matter on August 13, 1984.
  
   Miller v. Cudahy Co.,
  
  592 F.Supp. 976 (D.Kan.1984). Therein, the Court found defendants liable to plaintiffs for actual damages to growing crops in the amount of $3,060,000.00, and also found defendants liable for punitive damages in the amount of $10,000,000.00. Because of trial testimony indicating that a cleanup of the aquifer might be technologically feasible, the Court ordered the punitive damage award held in abeyance pending evaluation of potential cleanup alternatives. The Court ordered the defendants to undertake an investigation of the aquifer in conjunction with an expert to be designated by the plaintiffs, to keep the Court apprised of their discoveries, and to prepare a final report on the available scientific cleanup alternatives. Pending this, the Court retained jurisdiction over the punitive damage award. The Court certified the judgment of liability and the judgment for actual damages as a final appealable judgment pursuant to Rule 54(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. After defendants’ motion for a new trial had been denied, they filed notice of appeal on March 18, 1985. However, the Tenth Circuit dismissed the appeal as premature on February 3, 1986, so the case is still before this Court in full.
 

  Investigation towards a possible cleanup began, and a status conference was held before this Court the month after judgment was entered, on September 11, 1984. Defendants procured the expertise of Paul Roux of Roux Associates, Inc., New York, New York, ground water geologists; and of Leonard Eder of Eder Associates Consulting Engineers, p.c., Locust Valley, New York. Plaintiffs retained the services of Dr. Dan Raviv, a ground water hydrologist from West Orange, New Jersey, to monitor and evaluate what the defendants were doing. Plaintiffs had used Dr. Raviv extensively in discovery and trial, and the Court had already found his credibility high and his integrity impeccable. Almost immediately, the remedial investigation became a problem in its own right. Continual controversies arose over plaintiffs’ denying defendants access to their lands for the purposes of conducting their investigations, and regarding damages resulting from such access. Progress reports were filed, but it became apparent that the ecological situation was more complex than originally envisioned. The Court had initially ordered that a final report on available alternatives be filed within eight months of the August 13, 1984 Opinion and Order, but it was not until November 20, 1985 that defendants’ four volume proposed remedial action plan with supporting documents was filed. That plan, and the subsequent developments of proposed plans, will be discussed later in this Opinion.
 

  In the meantime, numerous motions, related to the cleanup only tangentially if at all, inundated the Court. Following the Court’s Order in August of 1984, the expected motions for an amended judgment or new trial, along with motions regarding costs taxed by the Clerk, were filed. But in August of 1985, defendants filed their second (though not last) motion for a new trial. From then until this past summer not a month went by without one of the parties filing a substantive motion of some form for this Court’s determination: mo
   
   *321
   
  tions to compel, to quash, to strike; motions for Court appointed experts, for evidentiary hearings, for temporary restraining orders; motions to preclude evidence, to disqualify law firms, to strike affidavits. In the month of February, 1986, alone, six substantive motions, not including motions for extension of time (which inevitably engendered their own controversies), were filed for this Court’s consideration. Each motion required responsive filings, some necessitated hearings, all consumed vast amounts of the parties’ and the Court’s time. While not intimating that the parties’ filings of these motions were procedurally impermissible, the Court nonetheless found them frustrating to the original intent of retaining jurisdiction over the case for the sole purpose of considering remedial cleanup plans for potential batement of the punitive damage award. However, as will be demonstrated
  
   infra,
  
  the development and discussion of numerous cleanup proposals were not inhibited by these ancillary actions.
 

  It is the Court’s intention in this Opinion and Order to resolve the remaining substantive motions in this action, to evaluate the proposed remedial plans before it, and to enter a final judgment as to all parts of this case. While the Court suffers under no delusion that its action will bring to a close this Jarndycian matter, the Court ardently hopes that by at least allowing the inevitable appellate process to begin, the illusive end of this case may come closer to reality.
 

  II. MOTION TO DISMISS
 

  Defendant General Host has filed with this Court a motion captioned Motion to Reconsider Denial of General Host’s Motion to Dismiss. In fact, the Court’s review of the voluminous filings in this case reveals that General Host has not previously filed a motion to dismiss. The defendant concedes that this is, in fact, an initial motion for dismissal.
 

  A.
  
   Consideration of Defendant’s Reply Memorandum
  


  Before the Court addresses the merits of defendant’s motion to dismiss, it must first resolve a procedural dispute. In the ongoing contentious spirit of this case, plaintiffs have filed a motion to strike the defendant’s reply memorandum in support of its motion to dismiss. The parties’ pervasive fear that the other side might get the last word on some ancillary or tertiary matter has lead to a preponderance of the collateral attack stratagem of the “motion to strike” throughout the pendency of this case. This approach has been used no less than seven times in the post trial phase of these proceedings.
  
   See
  
  Dk. nos. 593 (plaintiffs’ motion to strike portions of defendants’ experts’ report), 616 (defendants’ motion to strike plaintiffs’ “Observations and Objections to the Cleanup Plan”), 639 (defendants’ motion to strike affidavits), 665 (plaintiffs’ motion to strike defendants’ memorandum in connection with the entry of a final judgment), 686 (plaintiffs’ motion to strike affidavits), 687 (plaintiffs’ motion to strike defendants’ reply memorandum), and 696 (plaintiffs’ motion to strike status report). Each of these motions has then engendered its own series of responses and replies, and required court rulings. Aside from unnecessarily cluttering the file, the absurdity of this situation is demonstrated here by Dk. no. 694 which is (there is simply no other way to put it) “Plaintiffs’ reply to defendant’s response to plaintiffs’ motion to strike defendant’s reply to plaintiffs’ response to defendant’s motion to reconsider denial of General Host’s motion to dismiss.” At times, the Court has almost required the services of a cartographer to keep straight which issue these filings address.
 

  Plaintiffs ask the Court to strike this memorandum (the litany will not be repeated) because they allege that it was filed untimely, it is three times as long as the original memorandum in support of the motion and it addresses issues not raised in previous filings. While plaintiffs may have valid concerns, in this case it is simply too late in the day to begin policing the time and length of filings. Plaintiffs’ motion is denied. The Court will now address the merits of defendant’s motion to dismiss.
 

 
   *322
   
  B.
  
   General Host’s Connection to American Salt
  


  American Salt was acquired by Cudahy Company around 1930, and operated as a division of that company thereafter. In 1971, General Host acquired a controlling interest in Cudahy Company, and gained full ownership of Cudahy in 1972. Defendant claims that Cudahy was acquired by General Host mainly for its large meat packing business, and that Cudahy’s salt division was only an incidental part of that acquisition. In 1984, American Salt was separately incorporated as a wholly owned subsidiary of Cudahy Company, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of General Host Corporation. Apparently, in 1985, Cudahy Company was renamed AMS Industries, Inc., although the Court has not been formally notified of this change. At no time has American Salt been an operating division of General Host Corporation.
 

  Defendant General Host argues that, by the time it acquired Cudahy Company, American Salt had been in operation over 60 years. In 1968, state monitor wells were installed by KDHE to evaluate groundwater pollution, and the condition of the aquifer resulted in KDHE’s requiring American Salt to install the east water well in 1972, which through continuous pumping since its installation has removed tons of chlorides from the aquifer. Despite this, defendant argues that it did not discover the
  
   extent
  
  of the pollution until after the lawsuit was filed, and then it concedes that most of what it learned was gleaned from the plaintiffs. While apparently not denying
  
   any
  
  knowledge of pollution prior to that time, General Host chides the Court for failing to acknowledge in its Opinion and Order that defendant was the last to discover about the pollution and its connection to the salt plant. General Host disputes the Court’s imputation of knowledge of the groundwater pollution to it based on KDHE’s imposition of fines for surface spills.
 

  The Court will agree that General Host learned of the groundwater pollution emanating from the salt plant well after plaintiffs or their predecessors, Cudahy Company, and the American Salt plant all knew of the problem. But this fact is inconsequential. General Host cannot deny that it knew there was a pollution problem of some magnitude when it acquired the company. The fact that it was unaware of the extent of that pollution is irrelevant; no one was fully aware of the extent of the pollution until after discovery in the suit began. In fact, as this Opinion and Order will demonstrate later, much has been learned about the extent of the pollution since the trial in this case. But it is hardly a surprising proposition that ignorance of the full extent of the damage caused by one’s negligent or willful acts does not afford a defense to liability for those acts.
 

  C.
  
   Timeliness of Motion to Dismiss
  


  More cogently, General Host argues for dismissal under the doctrine of piercing the corporate veil, on the theory that the Court applied the wrong legal analysis when it originally considered General Host’s liability. The Court did not originally address the corporate veil theory for the simple reason that no motion to dismiss General Host was previously before it. Before the Court can address that theory now, it finds that it must first address a procedural question.
 

  It has already been conceded that, despite the caption of this motion, General Host has not heretofore moved for dismissal. The question therefore naturally arises whether such a motion, made almost two years after
  
   trial
  
  in this case was concluded, is timely. To consider that question, the Court must first determine the procedural basis on which General Host seeks dismissal. For instance, if it was moving for dismissal under Rule 12(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, “lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter,” timeliness would not be a concern. It is undisputed that a court may dismiss a case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction
  
   at any
  
  time, even on appeal. Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(h)(3). Here, defendant did not specify its grounds for dismissal. The Court, after examining all possibilities, has concluded
   
   *323
   
  that the motion must be based on Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, “failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.” No other grounds for dismissal are applicable, and defendant’s allegation that plaintiff’s complaint does not aver any facts showing that General Host Corporation is liable for the plaintiffs’ injuries is most appropriately characterized as a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).
 

  While a 12(b)(6) defense is not waived if not made in an original motion or responsive pleading, as are defenses under Rules 12(b)(2), 12(b)(3), 12(b)(4), and 12(b)(5),
  
   see
  
  Rule 12(h)(1), it also does not have the open ended nature of a Rule 12(b)(1) defense. Instead, its timeliness is to be considered under Rule 12(h)(2), which allows the defense to be raised at any pleading permitted or required under Rule 7(a), by a motion for judgment on the pleadings, or at trial. Technically, Rule 12(b) requires that all such motions be asserted in a responsive pleading or a motion filed in lieu of the response. Rule 12(h) only serves to preserve certain
  
   defenses
  
  that could have been asserted initially in a Rule 12(b) motion. After the time for filing a Rule 12(b) motion has passed, such defenses must be raised in the form of a motion such as a motion for summary judgment or for judgment on the pleadings. Wright & Miller, 5
  
   Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil
  
  § 1357. However, this fine distinction is not dispositive in this case, as defendant has not filed a 12(b)(6) motion, but only seeks to raise a defense allowable under 12(b)(6).
 

  General Host did not move for dismissal upon such grounds in its joint answer with Cudahy Company. It did deny that the American Salt plant had ever been maintained at the direction of any defendant other than Cudahy, which is consistent with its corporate veil argument here. Dk. no. 5, ¶ 9. Additionally, it alleged that all claims for relief set forth in plaintiffs’ complaint failed to state a cause of action upon which relief could be granted against either defendant. Dk. no. 5, ¶ 35. But, although it asserted the defense then, it did not then move for dismissal upon those grounds. Nor has defendant since moved for dismissal on such grounds in any motion for judgment on the pleadings, as permitted by Rule 12(h)(2). Finally, defendant did not make such a motion for dismissal at trial.
 

  The Court construes Rule 12(h)(2) as limiting the time for raising such a defense to the enumerated occasions. While that subsection is considerably more permissive than Rule 12(h)(1), it can not be construed to allow such defenses to be raised at any time. If that were so, then the reason for separating out the provisions in Rule 12(h)(3), and specifying that such defenses may be raised
  
   “Whenever,”
  
  would not make sense. Instead, the Rules seem clear that the defenses specified in Rule 12(h)(1) must be raised in the initial motion or response, the defenses specified in Rule 12(h)(3) may be raised at any time, and the defenses specified in Rule 12(h)(2), while not required to be raised initially, cannot be raised indiscriminately but only on the specified occasions. The occasions specified in Rule 12(h)(2) are generous and liberal, allowing such defenses to be raised at any time up to and including trial. But the separate enumerations of 12(h)(2) and 12(h)(3) would indicate to this Court that a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted cannot be made at any time. More specifically, it cannot be made after trial. Because defendant’s motion was not made on one of the allowable occasions, the Court finds the motion untimely.
 

  Although defendant did not discuss Rule 12(h)(2) in any filing connected with this motion, the Court notes that it did discuss it in Dk. no. 706, which deals with a separate issue. There, defendant asserted that such a motion can be made at any time prior to the entry of final judgment. Defendant apparently arrived at this conclusion by running together the “time of trial” and the “time of entry of final judgment.” In a normal case, the difference between these two times would be slight. This is not a normal case. There will be a difference of almost three years between the conclusion of trial and the entry of final judgment. In such an instance, the fine
   
   *324
   
  line must be drawn, and the Rule clearly draws it at the time of trial as the latest allowable time. Defendant’s motion was not made then, so it was not made timely.
 

  Cases under the Rule, and commentators on it, discuss timing of Rule 12 motions in terms of the time for
  
   filing
  
  a Rule 12(b) motion, and the time for
  
   preserving
  
  a Rule 12(b) defense pursuant to Rule 12(h). The Court has found few cases that discuss the instance where a Rule 12(b) defense is raised timely, but a motion for dismissal on those grounds is not made until after trial. The issue arose on appeal in
  
   Smith v. Atlas Off-Shore Boat Service, Inc.,
  
  653 F.2d 1057, 1060 n. 1 (5th Cir.1981), where the Circuit Court allowed the defense of failure to state a claim to be asserted on appeal because, while Atlas did not specifically raise the issue at trial, it “sufficiently alerted the trial court to its contention that there is no claim ... [and] adequately raised the issue to preserve it for appellate review.”
  
   Id.
  
  Likewise, in
  
   Madore v. Ingram Tank Ships, Inc.,
  
  732 F.2d 475, 479-80 (5th Cir.1984), the Fifth Circuit again noted the rule that the defense that a complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted must be raised before the completion of trial, but noted that if “the defense is
  
   actually
  
  raised in the trial court, it is not waived by failure to assert it in a specific manner.”
  
   Id.
  
  (emphasis added). In
  
   Brule v. Southworth,
  
  611 F.2d 406, 409 (1st Cir.1979), the court determined that defendants’ argument, though presented as jurisdictional, was in reality premised on the contention that plaintiffs had failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, and that it was “fatal that defendants never asserted any such ground in the district court, either before or during trial.”
  
   Id.
  
  The court noted that the grounds could have been asserted and therefore preserved “by means of a directed verdict, judgment on the pleadings or the like.”
  
   Id.
  
  at n. 4. See also
  
   Sartin v. Commissioner of Public Safety,
  
  535 F.2d 430 (8th Cir.1976).
 

  Based on this authority, the Court must conclude that merely raising the defense in an answer is not sufficient of itself to preserve the defense so that a motion to dismiss based on that defense can be raised at
  
   any time.
  
  While the above cited cases all deal with cases on appeal, it must be conceded that in the normal course of things, a case goes to appeal immediately after trial. The instance here, where the trial court has retained jurisdiction for over two years after trial, merely to fashion the form of the damages awarded, is highly unusual to say the least. The Court points out that it retained jurisdiction for one specific purpose only: to evaluate a potential cleanup to be implemented in lieu of some or all of the punitive damages award. The Court certified the balance of the decision, including the finding of liability against General Host, for appeal. Although the Tenth Circuit declined to exercise appellate review until the entire case was before it, that does not change the finality of this Court’s decision. It is immaterial that the trial court still has jurisdiction over the matter; trial has been held, liability established, and judgment entered. The interests of judicial finality are the same in this instance as they are in the case of appellate review. Absent something more than a bald recital in the defendants' answer of the defense of failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, this Court is convinced that the weight of authority is overwhelming that such a motion, made after trial, is made too late. Therefore, the Court must conclude that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure no longer permit it to entertain such a motion.
 

  Defendant General Host’s motion to dismiss is denied as untimely plead.
 

  III. MOTION FOR A NEW TRIAL
 

  A.
  
   Procedural Posture of the Case
  


  On August 12, 1985, eight years after this case was filed and a year and a half after it was tried, defendants filed a motion with this Court seeking a new trial pursuant to Rules 60(b)(2) and 60(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The ground asserted for their motion was “newly discovered evidence,” evidence they were later to assert was “practically con-
   
   *325
   
  elusive.” Dk. no. 573, p. 31. As had become par for this action, the motion was hotly contested and exhaustively briefed by both sides.
 

  On January 31, 1986, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals granted defendants’ motion to dismiss the appeal in this case as premature. The appeal had been taken pursuant to this Court’s order of August 13, 1984, certifying as final appealable orders the determination of liability and the judgment for actual damages, pursuant to Rule 54(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The Circuit, however, held that this Court’s judgment was not a final judgment under 28 U.S.C. § 1291.
  
   Miller v. Cudahy,
  
  No. 85-1450 (10th Cir.,
  
   unpublished,
  
  January 31, 1986).
 

  Because of the Circuit’s ruling, the defendants’ motion for a new trial pursuant to Rule 60 was procedurally premature. Therefore, on February 10, 1986, they filed a motion for an evidentiary hearing to revise and amend the findings of fact and conclusions of law issued by this Court ""on August 13, 1984, or, in the alternative, for a new trial, pursuant to Rule 54(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. They seek essentially the same relief sought in their earlier new trial motion. This motion was filed only to restate, on procedurally correct grounds, their request for that relief. Defendants in that motion incorporate by reference all of their earlier “new trial” filings. Therefore, the Court will consider the two motions and their progeny filings together.
 

  B.
  
   Standards for Motions for New Trial or To Revise and Amend
  


  1.
  
   Federal Rules of Civil Procedure
  


  Rule 54(b) provides as follows:
 

  Judgment Upon Multiple Claims or Involving Multiple Parties. When more than one claim for relief is presented in an action, whether as a claim, counterclaim, cross-claim, or third party claim, or when multiple parties are involved, the court may direct the entry of a final judgment as to one or more but fewer than all of the claims or parties only upon an express determination that there is no just reason for delay and upon an express direction for the entry of judgment. In the absence of such determination and direction, any order or other form of decision, however designated, which adjudicates fewer than all the claims or the rights and liabilities of fewer than all the parties
  
   shall not terminate the action as to any of the claims or parties, and the order or other form of decision is subject to revision at any time before the entry of judgment adjudicating all the claims and the rights and liabilities of all the parties,
  
  (emphasis added).
 

  It is clear that under this Rule the Court retains the power to alter decisions until final judgment is made in a case.
  
   Paramount Pictures Corp. v. Thompson Theatres,
  
  621 F.2d 1088, 1090 (10th Cir.1980);
  
   United States v. Desert Gold Mining Co.,
  
  433 F.2d 713, 715 (9th Cir.1970). But the real question is not if the Court can alter rulings, but whether the Court should. While Rule 54(b) implicitly allows revisions, it does not address under what circumstances or for what causes such revisions should be made. Considering that this action was a trial to the court and not to a jury, the Court finds that in this instance a motion to alter or amend is essentially a motion for a new trial. Therefore the Court finds that its consideration of this issue should also be governed by Rules 59 and 60 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which provide in relevant part:
 

  Rule 59. New Trials; Amendment of Judgments
 

  (a) Grounds. A new trial may be granted to all or any of the parties and on all or part of the issues ... (2) in an action tried without a jury, for any of the reasons for which rehearings have heretofore been granted in suits in equity in the courts of the United States. On a motion for a new trial in an action tried without a jury, the court may open the judgment if one has been entered, take additional testimony, amend findings of fact and conclusions of law or make new findings and conclusions, and direct the entry of a new judgment.
 

 
   *326
   
  (b) Time for Motion. A motion for a new trial shall be served not later than 10 days after the entry of judgment. Rule 60. Relief from Judgment or Order
 

  (b) Mistakes; Inadvertence; Excusable Neglect; Newly Discovered Evidence; Fraud, etc. On motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may relieve a party or his legal representative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding for the following reasons: ... (2) newly discovered evidence which by due diligence could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under Rule 59(b); ... (6) any other reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment. The motion shall be made within a reasonable time____
 

  Because defendants timely filed a new trial motion following the August, 1984 entry of judgment, and because the instant motion was filed within ten days of the Circuit’s ruling, the Court finds that none of defendants’ motions now under consideration are time barred. Because this action was tried to the Court, all motions are being considered in conjunction for the relief the defendants seek, procedural distinctions aside. Motions for new trial and for reconsideration are closely related, so the movants should be granted whatever relief their motion shows them entitled to.
  
   United States Gypsum Co. v. Schiavo Brothers, Inc.,
  
  668 F.2d 172 (3rd Cir.1981),
  
   cert. denied,
  
  456 U.S. 961, 102 S.Ct. 2038, 72 L.Ed.2d 485 (1982). The Court notes that defendants’ new trial motion of August 12, 1985, sought relief pursuant to Rules 60(b)(2) and 60(b)(6).

  The law is well settled that to reopen trial proceedings for newly discovered evidence, three requirements must be met. First, the evidence must have existed at the time of trial, but not have been known to the movant. Second, the evidence must be such that it could not have been discovered in time to present it at the original proceedings by the exercise of due diligence. And third, the evidence must be such that it would probably have produced a different outcome had it been presented initially.

  88 F.R.D. 526 (D.Conn.1980),
  
   aff'd
  
  636 F.2d 907 (2d Cir.1981). These three factors will
   
   *327
   
  govern the Court’s consideration in this case.
 

  For this matter, the Court would particularly emphasize two of those factors. Of preeminent concern in evaluating defendants’ “newly discovered evidence” is whether that evidence, by the exercise of due diligence, could have been discovered in time for trial. A judgment may not be set aside, or in this case modified or amended, on the grounds of newly discovered evidence where that evidence is the type which with due diligence the defendants could have discovered in time for the original trial or proceeding.
  
   Music Research, Inc. v. Vanguard Recording Society, Inc.,
  
  547 F.2d 192 (2nd Cir.1976).
 

  Even if the evidence is such that it could not by due diligence have been discovered, to support a motion for a new trial the evidence must be material to the issues and must be of such a nature that it would probably change the outcome.
  
   Stridiron v. Stridiron,
  
  698 F.2d 204 (3rd Cir.1983). While this factor is most generally applied to exclude evidence that is merely cumulative or impeaching in nature, it goes beyond that. New evidence, even if genuinely new and material, regarding a relevant aspect of the trial subject matter and regarding an issue that was not presented at the trial or that would have cast evidence presented at trial in a significantly different light, does not thereby automatically warrant a new trial. Instead, the Court must look at the new evidence in light of the total evidence presented at trial. Where the weight of the evidence presented at trial is so overwhelmingly in support of the initial verdict that the introduction of this new evidence, probative and significant though it may be, would still not have changed the final outcome, then a new trial is not justified. “The strength or weakness of the evidence against the defendant is an important and often decisive factor in judging the new evidence supporting a motion to vacate, because the fundamental purpose of the Rule 60(b) motion is to prevent the judgment from becoming a vehicle of injustice.”
  
   United States v. Walus,
  
  616 F.2d 283, 288 (7th Cir.1980).
 

  In a matter that was tried to a jury, the Court perhaps must be careful in making such a determination as to the outcome altering nature of this new evidence, and give the movant the benefit of any doubt. But in a matter such as this which was tried to the Court, the Court can assess even the closer questions, and if it determines that the introduction of this newly discovered evidence, viewed in the best possible light, would still not have changed the verdict as to liability or damages, then it need not order that a new trial or hearing be held.
 

  C.
  
   Newly Discovered Evidence: Proffered
  


  In light of these standards governing the exercise of the court’s discretion as to whether to grant a new trial or hearing to alter or amend its original findings of fact and conclusions of law, the Court will now review the proffered “newly discovered evidence.” Defendants assert that this evidence is relevant to punitive damages, equitable relief, liability and actual damages; in short, to everything. The Court will not add to the already lengthy nature of this opinion and order by reviewing the exhaustive findings and conclusions made initially in its Opinion, reported at
  
   Miller v. Cudahy Co.,
  
  592 F.Supp. 976 (D.Kan.1984).
 

  Defendants offer a wealth of new evidence, which the Court shall attempt to arrange in some form of topical grouping. The Court is repeating here only the evidence proffered by defendants. It should be emphasized that this recitation is not to be taken as the Court’s acceptance of these “facts” as proven. Plaintiffs have not had an opportunity to conduct discovery of their own on these issues, nor to cross examine defendants’ witnesses and experts or evaluate defendants’ reports. Should a new trial or hearing be held the facts found there may differ from this proffer. The Court only examines defendant’s “new evidence” to determine if, taking all of their assertions as true, the evidence would warrant a new trial.
 

  Defendants assert that their testing has revealed several hitherto unknown aspects of the aquifer. Among these are that the
   
   *328
   
  rate of groundwater flow and recharge rate is much slower than was believed at trial. Additionally, defendants have discovered that sodium pollution, rather than chloride pollution, from the brine presents the major obstacle to an environmental cleanup. Due to a phenomenon known as the Sodium Adsorption Ratio [SAR], the pollution will take much longer to clear. The problem presented by SAR is that the clay particles surrounding the aquifer absorb sodium from the polluted water; then, after all of the polluted water will have hypothetically passed and clean water is flowing through the aquifer, the clay would release sodium into that water, re-polluting the water. Because of this, it is not sufficient for all of the presently polluted water to flow through the area (assuming no further pollution, an assumption not warranted by any facts at this time); instead, two to three times that amount of water must flow past the sodium laden clay in order to thoroughly “rinse” out the pollution. Because the aquifer is moving much slower than originally believed, and because much more water will be required to flow through the aquifer to cleanse it than originally believed, defendants assert that the aquifer would not naturally cleanse itself of the salt plume in twenty to thirty years as suggested at trial. In fact, defendants suggest to this Court that it would take two to three hundred years for such a cleansing to occur!
 

  As a corollary to the reduced recharge rate of the aquifer, defendants assert that the aquifer, even in an unpolluted state, would not support irrigation by all of the plaintiffs. They direct the Court’s attention to the recently reduced irrigation permit allowances by the Big Bend Groundwater Management District. Under these restrictions, plaintiffs could not all obtain permits to irrigate the affected land even if good water existed. Defendants further assert that, had plaintiffs all been irrigating, in light of the aquifer’s low recharge rate the aquifer would have been severely mined by now, and perhaps permanently damaged. Defendants further assert that more accurate mapping of the plume has revealed that some of the plaintiffs’ land is not even affected by the underground water pollution, and that some of the plaintiffs’ land has access to good water for irrigation. Defendants assert that these facts go to the actual damages awarded at trial.
 

  Defendants allege to have discovered another plume “upstream” from this one, emanating from an old Carey salt mine. Although this plume does not now join with the plume which is the subject of this dispute, defendants attempt to imply that the plumes may once have been connected (without explaining how they could have once been connected and are not now, since both flow in the same direction). Defendants therefore assert that American Salt may not be solely to blame for the instant plume. They further assert that the pumping of one of their wells is preventing this plume from spreading further, and congratulate themselves for this without showing that it has any relevance to the present suit.
 

  Defendants assert that recent testing has shown that, contrary to the finding made by this Court following trial, their brine fields are not leaking. The Court would note that plaintiffs hotly dispute this “finding,” as they did at trial. As will be demonstrated below, evidence offered during the remedial phase of this case, not the least of which was from Kansas Department of Health and Environment, continues to support the Court’s original finding that the brine fields have been leaking and are continuing to leak.
 

  Defendants assert that, based on the slow flow rate of the aquifer and the presence of an intercept well on their property, any chlorides that escape from the plant will be (and have been) intercepted before they reach the aquifer lying under any of the plaintiffs’ land. Therefore, they are not now causing any pollution to plaintiffs’ property.
 

  These are the meat of defendants’ proffered “new evidence.” Again the Court would emphasize that this “evidence” has not been subjected to plaintiffs’ scrutiny, and the facts are therefore not proven facts. The Court will now evaluate them in
   
   *329
   
  light of the earlier listed standards for granting a new trial motion.
 

  D.
  
   Newly Discovered Evidence: Evaluated
  


  1.
  
   Groundwater Management District’s Permit Requirements
  


  Initially, the Court dismisses consideration of the recently revised Big Bend Groundwater Management District’s permit requirements. That revision occurred after the trial in this matter, and as such did not exist at the time of trial. “Compelling policies of finality require that in the absence of exceptional circumstances, events occurring after a trial on the merits cannot justify the reopening of a judgment.”
  
   County of Trinity v. Andrus,
  
  77 F.R.D. 29, 30 (E.D.Cal.1977). Defendants argue that this rule does not apply here because the revised regulations only reflect the realities of the aquifer, realities which existed at the time of trial. The Court will consider the “newly discovered” aquifer characteristics shortly. The Court notes, however, that at trial one of the factors considered in the damage award was that plaintiffs could have obtained permits to irrigate
  
   but for
  
  the fact that the water was unsuitable for irrigation (Kansas law does not allow a permit to be granted for irrigation unless it will actually be put into use; where the water cannot be used, as here, no permit will be granted solely for that reason).
 

  Had plaintiffs in fact been given irrigation permits and begun to irrigate, and had such irrigation in fact so seriously threatened the aquifer as to cause the groundwater management district to take action, the Court cannot speculate on what action the Groundwater Management District would have taken. It is possible that they would have revoked some of the farmers’ irrigation permits, but it is just as possible that they would have revoked some of American Salt’s water permits, especially since American Salt holds the lion’s share of the area’s permits. The fact remains that, at the time of trial, plaintiffs could have obtained permits for irrigation if not for the pollution. That permit requirements were later changed so that, today, they could not obtain such permits even were the water pure, is immaterial.
 

  2.
  
   Ancillary Motion to Revise or Amend: Lost Crop Profits
  


  The Court should note at this point that defendants disagree with some of the assertions just made regarding plaintiffs’ ability to obtain irrigation permits. They have, in fact, filed a “Motion to Revise or Amend the August 13, 1984 Opinion to Dismiss the Claims for Lost Crop Profits of those Plaintiffs Who Have No Water Permits to Irrigate Their Lands.” Dk. no. 697. This motion to revise or amend is separate from the motion to revise or amend which the Court has been discussing (Dk. no. 604), and from the motions for New Trial, or in the alternative, to Revise or Amend which defendants have filed previously (Dk. nos. 526, 462). Defendants assertion in the instant motion, Dk. no. 697, is that the plaintiffs, with the exception of three who had secured water permits, cannot recover for lost crop profits due to their inability to irrigate because they had no permit, and therefore no legal right, to irrigate.
 

  Defendants present the Court with a detailed review of Kansas law on water rights. They assert that plaintiffs could have acquired a “vested right” to water prior to July 1, 1980, if they had made “continous application for water for beneficial use since on or before June 28, 1945.” Dk. no. 697, p. 5, citing K.S.A. § 82a-701(d). Of course, as this Opinion has previously demonstrated, pollution of the water which prevented any beneficial use has existed since well before 1945. Defendants unsurprisingly do not mention this. They also assert that plaintiffs could have acquired an “appropriation right” through the permitting process. Defendants do not actually deny that use of the water is necessary to obtain and maintain a permit. They do assert with great aplomb that neither state law or groundwater management district rules and regulations “require a water quality test as a condition for obtaining a permit.” Dk. no. 697, p. 6.
   
   *330
   
  They further suggest that all plaintiffs needed to have done was file an application and obtain a permit while water rights were still available and then timely request extensions for perfecting the permit, i.e., putting the water to beneficial use. Defendants assure the Court that plaintiffs could have obtained an exception to the rule that water rights not used for three consecutive years are forfeited, based upon a showing of due and sufficient cause (pollution). By following these steps, defendants conclude, “[pjlaintiffs would thereby have secured their right to use the water as soon as it was clean.” Dk. no. 697, p. 10. Of course, these are the same defendants who initially suggested to plaintiffs and to this Court that the water would not be clean for two hundred years.
  
   See
  
  V. REMEDIAL ACTION PLANS,
  
   infra.
  


  Prom a theoretical standpoint, plaintiffs may have been able to obtain some type of water permits by following the contorted process defendants suggest. But this interesting legal theory has no application to the real world in which plaintiffs live. They are landowners, not barristers. They only wish to spend their time farming, not engaging in the testing of novel legal theories. State agencies such as the Big Bend Groundwater Management District and the State Board of Agriculture, Division of Water Resources have suggested to the Court that one could not obtain a permit for water unless he actually were to use the water.
  
   See
  
  Transcript of June 2, 1986 hearing, pp. 46, 50. Of course, this water is unusable. If this interpretation by the state agencies is not technically correct, assuming without deciding that defendants’ suggestion is a theoretical possibility, the plaintiffs are not to be faulted for relying on that understanding. Plaintiffs did not seek water permits because they could not use the water, even if they had permits. To conclude therefore that they are estopped or precluded from receiving damages for their inability to irrigate is inequitable; it turns the law on its head. Speaking of the Kansas Water Appropriation Act, the Kansas Supreme Court said:
 

  Under this declaration and other provisions of the act we now approach [questions concerning water rights] upon the basis of the interest of the people of the state without losing sight of the beneficial use the individual is making or has the right to make of the water.
  
   Unused or unusable rights predicated alone upon theory become of little if any importance.
  



   State, ex rel., Emery v. Knapp,
  
  167 Kan. 546, 555, 207 P.2d 440 (1949) (emphasis added). Defendants’ suggested course of conduct may make sense in an Alice-in-Wonderland world; it makes no sense in ours.
 

  Further, plaintiffs demonstrate that defendants’ intervening cause argument— that the intervening cause of the failure of plaintiffs to obtain water permits for irrigation precludes their right to recover for loss of irrigated crops due to the pollution — is fatally flawed. Defendants’ argument presupposes that there is no relationship between the pollution and the failure of plaintiffs to obtain permits. But testimony received has demonstrated that plaintiffs have not applied for or received permits because the pollution prevented use of the water. The failure to obtain permits is not a cause of plaintiffs’ inability to irrigate; both the inability to obtain permits and the inability to irrigate are a result of defendants’ pollution of the aquifer. Evidence from plaintiffs and state officials has suggested, and the Court so finds, that it would have been futile for plaintiffs to apply for irrigation permits so long as the water was unfit for irrigation. Therefore, plaintiffs failure to apply for permits is excusable and does not bar their revovery for lost crop profits.
 

  Defendants argue that plaintiffs’ claim of futility is “totally spurious because the filing of a permit application is not ‘futile’ but a requisite first step to obtaining a water right.” Dk. no. 697, p. 10. This argument is non-responsive. Filing of a permit application is a requisite first step to obtaining a permit, but when other circumstances will bar the issuance of a permit, and those circumstances are known initially, the filing for a permit becomes
  
   both
  
  a requisite first step and a futile act.
   
   *331
   
  Plaintiffs’ futility argument is not totally spurious, but defendants’ tortuous dance around the law and the facts is.
 

  Defendants’ motion regarding lost crop profits is denied. Plaintiffs’ inability to obtain water permits augments their claim against defendants; it does not bar it. That Big Bend has subsequently revised the allowable amount of water permits available due to discovering the reduced aquifer recharge rate likewise does not bar plaintiffs’ action against defendants. Any difficulties which plaintiffs might encounter now in seeking to obtain water permits is immaterial to their previous failure to apply for permits. They did not apply when permits were available because defendants’ pollution prevented permits from being obtainable. The reduced permit allowances are not properly considerable as “newly discovered evidence,” and do not operate as a bar to plaintiffs request for damages against defendants. The Court will now examine the remaining prof-erred newly discovered evidence.
 

  3.
  
   Due Diligence
  


  The remaining “newly discovered facts” all seem to be of the nature of facts that did exist at the time of trial. Regarding these, defendants boldly assert that these facts are practically conclusive in themselves, and chide the Court that “[t]he only reasonable solution is for the Court to recognize that the
  
   real facts are the facts,
  
  regardless of when they were discovered.” Dk. no. 605, p. 5. Defendants cite no authority for this proposition, which is hardly surprising since, despite the appealing sound of the assertion, there is no authority for that statement as constituted. Even assuming that these “facts” could survive plaintiffs’ scrutiny and emerge unscathed as the “real facts,” and even assuming that these “real facts” were indeed conclusive in and of themselves, that is hardly the starting point in a motion for a new trial or a motion to alter and amend the court’s findings. Instead, the initial question must be, could these alleged facts have been discovered by defendants’ exercise of due diligence in time for the trial? Or, put another way, how many of these alleged facts could defendants not have discovered in time for trial, as opposed to how many they just did not discover?
 

  Defendants certainly did not lack for time. This case, filed nearly ten years ago, was in discovery for seven years before it was finally called to trial. Instead, it is very clear to this Court, which has watched the tortuous course of this case unfold, that defendants made a policy or strategy decision not to test the aquifer, not to investigate the complaints, not to inspect the damage; in short, to do nothing but ignore the entire matter. This course of inaction was followed despite requests by KDHE to test, and despite fines and the threat of further, more serious action by KDHE. It was done despite the pendency of this suit, and despite the sordid history spanning a half a century of complaints by neighboring land owners and state agencies regarding pollution. Defendants’ strategy was to pooh-pooh the allegations that they were polluting and to pretend that there was nothing to be alarmed about. Considering that this was the company line not only for the seven years of discovery in this case, but for the fifty years of plant operation, the Court will not now hear them say that they could not have discovered what the “real facts” of the aquifer were until after this suit. They made a conscious decision not to investigate the “real facts.” They must now live with that decision.
 

  Defendants deny that they had seven years to investigate this matter. They instead plead that they had no reason to look for this type of evidence until this Court’s order of June 21, 1983,
  
   Miller v. Cudahy Co.,
  
  567 F.Supp. 892 (D.Kan.1983). Defendants pretend that the 1983 order “radically altered” this litigation. Dk. no. 527, p. 25. The Court’s opinion of this claim of “surprise” is unprintable. The only thing that was radically altered by the 1983 order was that defendants were finally disabused of their notion that their beloved statute of limitations defense was the panacea to all their legal problems. As previously mentioned, defendants believed (or hoped) that their “prescription by pollution” theory
   
   *332
   
  would prevail; that if they polluted the environment long enough, it was theirs; and that they could not be called to account for what they did to it. The Court’s 1983 order refused to accept this base proposition. It is apparent to the Court that defendants continue to hold fast to this favorite son principle; but this Court continues just as strongly in its abhorrence to that line of defense.
 

  In fact, the “radical change” wrought in this matter by the 1983 order was not so radical as to suddenly require testing of the aquifer to determine the damage done, whereas before none had been required. This action was brought initially alleging pollution of the aquifer, and damage to the plaintiffs’ ability to irrigate as a result thereof. While there were varying arguments of permanent or temporary damages, which the 1983 order resolved, by no reasonable legal theory could the pre-resolution of that matter be regarded as putting the case in a posture where the condition of the aquifer which was alleged to be polluted was immaterial to the case.
 

  Even were the Court to accept defendants’ proposition that the defendants did not know it was necessary to test the aquifer until after the 1983 order, the Court could still not find that defendants are excused from not discovering this evidence prior to trial; that they could not have discovered it with the exercise of due diligence. The order “radically altering” the case was handed down on June 21, 1983. The case was called for trial on March 26, 1984, nine months later. Defendants contend that these nine months were insufficient to conduct the necessary discovery. They admit that they did not seek a continuance for the purpose of obtaining sufficient time to conduct this suddenly necessary investigation, but seek to excuse their failure on that account by complaining that the Court would not have allowed another extension in this already protracted matter then anyway. Whether the Court would have granted or denied a motion for continuance to allow additional discovery is speculative; what is certain is that defendants did not request continuance. If, as they claim, the 1983 order had indeed “radically altered” the course of this litigation, then seeking such a continuance would have been a natural, almost necessary, consequence. That they did not then seek such a continuance is perhaps indicative of the fact that they did not then truly believe that the litigation had been that altered. At any rate, the Court finds it passing strange that, after seven years of discovery defendants were too concerned about the protracted nature of the suit to seek an extension of a few months; but now, after ten years of proceedings, they are not so concerned but that they seek a new trial, which would cause at least another year of activity at the district level.
 

  Moreover, the Court is unpersuaded that those nine months were so fleeting as to not warrant even beginning an investigation. The Court handed down its judgment in this case on August 13, 1984. On September 11, 1984, a status conference was held with the parties concerning the development of a remedial investigation. At that time it was envisioned that the results of this investigation would be presented to the Court by April 1985, as ordered in the August ruling (“a final report ... shall be filed with the Court within eight months of the date on which this Opinion and Order is filed.” 592 F.Supp. at 1009.). Although the defendants now plead that the nine months between the 1983 order and the commencement of trial were too brief to warrant even beginning an investigation, they did not complain the next year when instructed to complete an entire remedial investigation within eight months. In fact, the development of the investigation later required them to seek extensions of time, but their final
  
   four volume
  
  report was filed with the Court on November 20,1985, fourteen months after the status conference.
 

  Thus, even if the Court were to accept defendants’ argument that testing of the aquifer was not required until after the 1983 order, and even if the Court were to accept defendants’ excuses for not seeking an extension of time in which to complete this testing, the Court could still not find that defendants were excused from
   
   *333
   
  the due diligence requirement to discover the facts prior to trial. Even then, sufficient time existed to begin an investigation. Defendants instead chose not to investigate. What their strategy was, whether hoping for an appellate resurrection of the “prescription by pollution” theory, or whether fearing that any facts uncovered could only hurt their cause, the Court can not divine. But it is painfully clear that the defendants, without excuse, made a decision not to investigate the damage to the aquifer. Not until forced by the Court, under threat of a ten million dollar punitive award, did they begin a remedial investigation. If the facts of that investigation have yielded evidence they believe would have been helpful at trial, that is unfortunate for them. “[Defendant's desire to introduce additional evidence after losing the case [does] not constitute a proper ground for granting a new trial.”
  
   Brown v. Wright,
  
  588 F.2d 708, 710 (9th Cir.1978).
 

  Adopting defendants’ theories would insure that no case was ever final; a party could drag its discovery out piecemeal and thereby require continual retrials. Even if it had no hope of winning, it could hope to wear its opponent down. Indeed, it is not surprising that defendants have attempted this approach; American Salt threatened plaintiffs years ago that if suit was filed “the money and lawyers available to American Salt would enable it to drag any litigation out for years, bankrupt [the plaintiffs] in the process, and take [their] land.”
  
   Miller,
  
  592 F.Supp. at 996. That threat has come close to becoming a reality. The disparity of resources between the parties has been a constant problem in this suit. It has resulted in the defendants being able to make voluminous filings of briefs, arguments and research far in excess of what the plaintiffs can match. “The defendants have seemingly limitless resources for the filing of written motions, memoranda, etc., in this case; their resources for so doing are far greater than those of the plaintiffs and their attorneys.” Dk. no. 609, p. 2. At recent hearings, plaintiffs’ counsel has made it clear that her clients have severely limited, for financial reasons, what additional legal action she could take.
 

  The Court is sympathetic to the plight of the plaintiffs, who, though small farmers, have been forced to pay the costs of this action for ten years and have so far gained no remuneration from it. Any additional delays sought by the defendants must be balanced against the increasing chance that rising costs to the plaintiffs may force them to abandon their action, especially in light of defendants’ earlier threat to do just that. This Court will not tolerate that type of litigation strategy. The Court finds that there was ample opportunity to discover this evidence during the years of discovery, and that defendants’ failure to do so warrants a denial of their motion now.
  
   McClean v. Alexander,
  
  449 F.Supp. 1251, 1263 (D.Del.1978),
  
   rev’d on other grounds,
  
  599 F.2d 1190 (3rd Cir.1979).
 

  Due diligence going to a new trial motion is a factual determination. The Court finds that had defendants exercised due diligence, they could have discovered this evidence in time for trial. Their failure to exercise due diligence requires that their new trial/relief from judgment/amend findings of fact and conclusions of law motions be denied.
 

  4.
  
   Outcome Altering Effect of New Evidence
  


  Although not necessary to the resolution of defendants’ motions, the Court further determines that, even had defendants exercised due diligence, their motion would not be granted. This Court sat as the fact finder in the original proceedings and heard the wealth of evidence presented there over the course of thirty-three days of trial. The weight of evidence against the defendants and in support of the final verdict was overwhelming. Examining the proffered “new evidence,” even without benefit of plaintiffs’ critique, the Court is persuaded that nothing is proffered which would have changed the verdict as to liability or punitive damages. The evidence could only possibly go to actual damages. While recognizing that the Tenth Circuit’s order in this case leaves the entire verdict, including actual damages, open to revision, this Court considered the actual damages
   
   *334
   
  phase of the suit to be over when the trial concluded in May of 1984. Nothing defendants have shown the Court now persuades it that its decision was wrong, or that the case should be reopened.
 

  5.
  
   Due Process Considerations
  


  Defendants warn the Court that an evidentiary hearing must be held because it would “avert any due process problems which might arise if the Court failed to afford the parties herein the opportunity to fully and fairly develop and present the evidence which has been discovered.” Dk. no. 605, p. 6. The Court agrees more with plaintiffs, who remind us that despite defendants’ “deep rumblings” about due process, due process is governed by the rules and authorities with which this Court has already evaluated defendants’ motions.
 

  Due process does not require that parties be allowed to present any evidence that they want to, at any time, regarding any subject matter, in complete disregard to the established rules of evidence and civil procedure. It only requires that the party suffering a loss be given an opportunity to be heard “at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.”
  
   Goldberg v. Kelly,
  
  397 U.S. 254, 267, 90 S.Ct. 1011, 1020, 25 L.Ed.2d 287 (1970). To suggest that this Court has not afforded defendants a meaningful opportunity to be heard is laughable. In addition to a very lengthy trial, numerous hearings have been held in this matter, some of them as long as a normal trial. At each of these hearings, defendants have been given full opportunity to present evidence and to Ã¢ÂÂ¢ examine plaintiffs’ evidence (the sole exception being the very last hearing held in this matter at which neither plaintiff nor defendant were allowed to present evidence, but where the Court received in open court the reports of state agencies’ evaluations of the proposed plans). Literally thousands of pages of memoranda have been filed by defendants. The Court has noted at some of these hearings that, if anything, this case was being “due processed to death.” For the defendants to suggest now, after ten years of activity, months of trial time, and volumes of pleadings that due process is being denied them is perhaps one of the most outlandish claims this Court has ever heard. If this matter has any problems, denial of due process certainly is not one of them.
 

  6.
  
   Any Other Reason for a New Trial
  


  In addition to seeking relief pursuant to Rule 60(b)(2), “newly discovered evidence,” defendants also seek a new trial pursuant to Rule 60(b)(6), “any other reason.” This rule is not an open ended invitation to seek a new trial for any reason, but is only designed to allow the Courts to do justice when equity demands, but the Rules otherwise do not provide authorization. This rule is especially “not a substitute for a motion for a new trial, particularly when it is grounded upon evidence which could have been discovered and timely presented through the exercise of due diligence.”
  
   Inter Financing Exchange S.A. v. Bartlett & Co., Grain,
  
  659 F.2d 1320, 1321 (5th Cir.1981). No other reason has been shown to the Court why a new trial or the functional equivalent is warranted. Therefore, application of this Rule is not justified.
 

  A motion for new trial is an extraordinary request, directed to the discretion of the Court. Defendants have not begun to meet their burden of demonstrating that the proceedings should be reopened. The Court has not been shown that justice requires it. Indeed, justice requires that plaintiffs not be caused to pay for defendants’ conscious decisions not to investigate earlier. The motions shall be denied.
 

  IV. COSTS, EXPENSES AND FEES
 

  On February 6, 1986, plaintiffs filed a motion for the award of Costs, Expenses and Fees incurred in conjunction with the remedial phase of this case (Dk. no. 602). They filed an itemized list of expenses for which they sought reimbursement. Receipts verifying most of the expenses for such reimbursement were attached to their motion. Because the case was in the midst of the remedial hearings at that time, the Court postponed ruling on plaintiffs’ mo
   
   *335
   
  tion, anticipating that any expenses of that nature which they had incurred they were likely to continue incurring. This presumption has proven accurate. Plaintiffs filed addendums to that motion, setting out additional like expenses incurred, on April 23, 1986 (Dk. no. 654); May 5, 1986 (Dk. no. 658); and May 9, 1986 (Dk. no. 659). The categories of expenses for which reimbursement is sought are transcripts, witness fees (including those expenses denominated as “Subpoena” in Dk. no. 659), laboratory expenses, expert expenses, telephone expenses, copying expenses, postage, attorneys’ travel expenses and attorneys’ fees.
 

  A.
  
   Background
  


  Before discussing the relevant merits of each requested item, the Court first emphasizes the unique nature of the proceedings which resulted in these expenses. All costs requested are for post trial proceedings, unlike the vast majority of reported cases dealing with costs which involve pretrial expenses only. The development and presentation of various plans that defendants have offered has proven to be a complicated and controversial matter, as this opinion will discuss later in some detail. The plaintiffs have incurred substantial additional expense in the course of this matter: post trial filings made have been nearly as voluminous as the pretrial fillings (which themselves ran into hundreds of docket entries and thousands of pages). The Court has attempted to make it clear throughout the long and contentious course of this remedial phase that the plaintiffs had
  
   already won
  
  the case, and that the Court felt that they should not be further penalized or prejudiced by post trial hearings or expenses collateral to defendants’ development of the remedial action plan. Neither plaintiffs’ verdict nor their their damages were in jeopardy during these proceedings; both had been established during trial at considerable expense to the plaintiffs — expenses for which they do not seek reimbursement. This portion of the case could not gain for them any additional benefit; it was not a hearing to determine the
  
   amount
  
  of damages, but only to determine the
  
   form
  
  which the damages might take. If any side stood to gain from these proceedings, it was not the plaintiffs, but the defendants, whose damages might be remitted in part due to their remedial efforts if equity justified it.
 

  Moreover, the Court cannot ignore the economic disparity between the parties. Defendants are divisions of a large, multicorporate entity; plaintiffs are merely local landowners/farmers. This disparity may have been irrelevant during the trial of the action plaintiffs themselves brought, but it is a valid consideration in a phase where plaintiffs have won the trial and the form of damages itself is the only consideration. The Court recognizes that defendants’ expenses during this phase of the proceedings have been substantial and have far exceeded the plaintiffs’ costs; but the Court also recognizes that defendants are more able to afford the expense than plaintiffs are, and that these proceedings are only for the benefit of the defendants. With these considerations in mind, the Court will now make the following determinations.
 

  B.
  
   Statutory Authority to Tax Costs
  


  The Court is authorized in its discretion to tax certain costs against the defendants pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1920. Among these are fees of the court reporter for transcripts and witness fees for non-party witnesses. These fees the Court taxes against defendants.
 

  The remaining categories of expenses the Court characterizes into the following groups: Attorneys’ fees (including both fees and attorney travel expenses); discovery costs (including telephone expense, copying and postage); and expert fees (including laboratory expenses and expert fees). The Court will discuss them seriatim.
 

  C.
  
   Discovery Costs
  


  The discovery costs sought by plaintiffs are not specifically authorized by any statute as costs which may be awarded. Discovery costs normally are not recoverable,
   
   *336
   
  as defendants point out, citing a previous opinion of this Court.
  
   Miller v. City of Mission,
  
  516 F.Supp. 1333, 1339 (D.Kan.1981) (quoting
  
   Quandt v. Beech Aircraft Corp.,
  
  No. W-4464 (D.Kan.,
  
   unpublished,
  
  Apr. 24, 1981)). Like other such costs, though, discovery costs may be taxed in certain circumstances.
  
   Worley v. Massey-Ferguson, Inc.,
  
  79 F.R.D. 534 (N.D.Miss.1978). The Court is granted a certain amount of discretion on such items pursuant to Rule 54(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which provides: “Except when express provision therefor is made either in a statute of the United States or in these rules, costs shall be allowed as of course to the prevailing party unless the court otherwise directs____” While the discretion granted the Court pursuant to this statute normally only applies to statutory items,
  
   see
  
  28 U.S.C. § 1920, the Court in its discretion may also award non-statutory costs which were reasonably incurred.
  
   Schmid v. Frosch,
  
  609 F.Supp. 490, 492 (D.D.C.1985).
 

  It is not surprising that the taxing of items such as postage, copying and telephone calls have not been clearly settled by statute, rules or case law. The Court has found instances in which such items were all taxed,
  
   see, e.g., Zeffiro v. First Pennsylvania Bank, N.A.,
  
  574 F.Supp. 443, 449 (E.D.Pa.1983),
  
   on reconsideration,
  
  581 F.Supp. 811 (E.D.Pa.1983),
  
   aff'd
  
  746 F.2d 1465 (3rd Cir.1984); and instances in which all items were all not,
  
   see, e.g., Keith v. Volpe,
  
  501 F.Supp. 403, 415 (C.D.Cal.1980). Other examples abound of either allowing these types of expenses,
  
   see, e.g., Lenard v. Argento,
  
  699 F.2d 874, 900 (7th Cir. 1983),
  
   cert. denied,
  
  464 U.S. 815, 104 S.Ct. 69, 78 L.Ed.2d 84 (1983);
  
   Clark v. Marsh,
  
  609 F.Supp. 1028, 1035-36 (D.D.C.1985);
  
   Davis v. Reed,
  
  72 F.R.D. 644 (N.D.Miss.1976); or of not allowing these types of expenses,
  
   see e.g., Wahl v. Carrier Manufacturing Co. Inc.,
  
  511 F.2d 209, 216-17 (7th Cir.1975);
  
   Zdunek v. Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority,
  
  100 F.R.D. 689, 692 (D.D.C.1983);
  
   Morrison v. Alleluia Cushion Co., Inc.,
  
  73 F.R.D. 70 (N.D.Miss.1976). Since the Court has just cited examples on both sides of the question from the same courts, it should be apparent that there is no hard and fast rule governing awards of these costs. Instead, the governing rule seems to be the discretion of the Court.
  
   Mikel v. Kerr,
  
  499 F.2d 1178, 1183 (10th Cir.1974);
  
   Welsch v. Likins,
  
  68 F.R.D. 589, 595 (D.Minn.1975),
  
   aff'd
  
  525 F.2d 987 (8th Cir.1975). The Court’s discretion is based on the ancient practice of equity.
  
   County of Suffolk v. Secretary of Interior,
  
  76 F.R.D. 469, 473 (E.D.N.Y.1977),
  
   cert. denied,
  
  434 U.S. 1064, 98 S.Ct. 1238, 55 L.Ed.2d 764 (1978). In equity, the Court is empowered to do what should be done to set things aright. In consideration of the unique situation of this matter, as set out in the introduction to this section, the Court finds good cause to exercise its equitable discretion to tax these costs against the defendants.
 

  D.
  
   Attorneys’Fees
  


  The Court next examines plaintiffs’ request for attorney fees. It has been established beyond contravention that the American Rule is that a prevailing litigant is not normally entitled to collect attorney fees from the loser.
  
   Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness Society,
  
  421 U.S. 240, 247, 95 S.Ct. 1612, 1616, 44 L.Ed.2d 141 (1975). The Supreme Court has made clear that this is not only the prevailing rule, but it is a rule to which the courts should not make exceptions without “legislative guidance.”
  
   Id.; Christiansburg Garment Co. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission,
  
  434 U.S. 412, 415, 98 S.Ct. 694, 697, 54 L.Ed.2d 648 (1978).
 

  There are a few established exceptions to this rule, which are also universally recognized. The most common exception is that attorney fees are awardable when Congress has specifically authorized the award by statute, or they are otherwise awardable pursuant to contract or agreement.
  
   Runyon v. McCrary,
  
  427 U.S. 160, 185, 96 S.Ct. 2586, 2601, 49 L.Ed.2d 415 (1976);
  
   Paramount Pictures Corp. v. Thompson Theatres, Inc.,
  
  621 F.2d 1088, 1091 (10th Cir.1980). They can also be awarded when the losing party brought or defended the action in bad faith or vexatiously.
  
   Rut
  
 
   *337
   

   ledge v. Sunderland,
  
  671 F.2d 377, 382 (10th Cir.1982);
  
   Kahan v. Rosenstiel,
  
  424 F.2d 161, 167 (3rd Cir.1970),
  
   cert. denied,
  
  398 U.S. 950, 90 S.Ct. 1870, 26 L.Ed.2d 290 (1970). None of these exceptions apply here.
 

  There is also discussion suggesting that this rule may not apply in a diversity case.
  
   Alyeska Pipeline,
  
  421 U.S. at 259, n. 31, 95 S.Ct. at 1622 n. 31. This exception is fashioned to allow enforcement of a state law which reflects a “substantial policy of the state.”
  
   Id.
  
  Although the diversity issue was raised here, Kansas has no such state law or policy.
 

  Plaintiffs also advance the “private attorney general” concept to support their request for fees in this instance. This theory supports awarding the prevailing parties such costs when they brought the action to benefit the public at large and without any large financial incentive of their own.
  
   Wilderness Society v. Morton,
  
  495 F.2d 1026 (D.C.Cir.1974). The application of this concept is strictly limited. It should not be used merely to jettison the traditional rule against the non-statutory award of attorneys fees to prevailing parties whenever a court determines that policy considerations support the award.
  
   Alyeska Pipeline,
  
  421 U.S. at 263, 95 S.Ct. at 1624. Some Circuits have expressly rejected the “private attorney general” concept supporting an award of attorney fees, finding that
  
   Alyeska Pipeline
  
  preempted that theory.
  
   Huecker v. Milburn,
  
  538 F.2d 1241, 1246 (6th Cir.1976);
  
   Skehan v. Board of Trustees of Bloomsburg State College,
  
  538 F.2d 53, 59 (3rd Cir.1976),
  
   cert. denied,
  
  429 U.S. 979, 97 S.Ct. 490, 50 L.Ed.2d 588 (1976). Construing that concept narrowly, the Court cannot find that it justifies an award of attorneys fees in this case. Plaintiffs did bring this action seeking clean water, but the water they sought to clean up was all under their own land. It cannot be said that plaintiffs brought this action without any substantial economic incentive on their own. They sought and were awarded substantial actual and punitive damages.
 

  In its previous discussion dealing with discovery costs, the Court relied in part on the provision of Rule 54(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to support an award of those costs to the plaintiffs. Rule 54(d) does give the Court broad discretion, but it does not encompass the award of attorney fees. The American Rule is too well established to allow the Court’s discretion to be stretched that far.
  
   Pigeaud v. McLaren,
  
  699 F.2d 401 (7th Cir.1983).
 

  Having considered all exceptions to the American Rule which might possibly be applicable, the Court finds that none warrant awarding attorneys fees to plaintiffs. The Court further finds that equity does not demand that attorneys fees be awarded in this particular instance. Therefore, this portion of their motion must be denied.
 

  E.
  
   Experts’Fees
  


  The last requested item for which plaintiffs seek indemnification is their expert expenses. The general rule regarding the recovery of experts’ fees is somewhat analogous to the American Rule regarding attorneys’ fees: they generally are not recoverable insofar as they exceed the statutory amount authorized for witnesses in general.
  
   Miller v. City of Mission,
  
  516 F.upp. 1333, 1340 (D.Kan.1981). However, this rule is not nearly as inflexible as the attorneys’ fees rule; indeed, some courts have held that it was an abuse of discretion for the trial court
  
   not
  
  to award expert fees in full.
  
   Coleman v. City of Omaha,
  
  714 F.2d 804, 809 (8th Cir.1983);
  
   Roberts v. S.S. Kyriakoula D. Lemos,
  
  651 F.2d 201 (3rd Cir.1981). Obviously, then, the award of experts’ fees cannot be completely analogized to the American Rule, but requires more of a factual analysis by the Court.
 

  The Court notes initially that case language exists which would suggest that experts’ fees are never taxable.
  
   Ramos v. Lamm,
  
  713 F.2d 546, 559 (10th Cir.1983).
  
   See also Illinois v. Sangamo Construction Co.,
  
  657 F.2d 855, 865 (7th Cir.1981);

  646 F.2d 689, 695 (1st Cir.1981);
  
   Jones v. Diamond,

   Ott v. Speedwriting Publishing Co.,
  
  518 F.2d 1143, 1149 (6th Cir.1975).
 

  A review of caselaw in full has persuaded the Court that the law is actually broader than such language may suggest. While the general rule is that such fees are not taxable, exceptions to that rule abound. Courts are allowed to award expert fees in their equitable discretion when the expert is court appointed, or when the Court finds that the experts’ testimony was crucial and indispensable to the resolution of the case.

   Keyes v. School District No. 1,
  
  439 F.Supp. 393 (D.Colo.1977). The Court finds the
  
   Keyes
  
  case especially apposite to this case. There the Court found an award of expert witness fees justified despite the usual rule because the expert’s testimony was indispensable to establishing the claim and
  
   determining the plan.
  


  Defendants argue to the Court that plaintiffs cannot rely on the “court-appointed expert” doctrine to justify an award of expert fees in this case because the Court expressly denied a motion by plaintiffs for a court appointed expert on February 25, 1986. Dk. no. 624. That order needs to be viewed in context. Plaintiffs’ motion (Dk. no. 560) specifically sought the appointment of “independent experts” or “special consultants.” The Court denied that motion upon a finding that “[a]t this time, ... plaintiffs’ and defendants’ experts are adequately developing the issues.” The Court also reserved the right to reconsider this matter later, if necessary. The Court never found it necessary to reconsider that decision, remaining convinced that the experts active in the case were doing an adequate and sufficient job. One of those experts was Dr. Dan Raviv, “plaintiffs' expert.” The Court has previously indicated, both in its written opinions
  
   (Miller,
  
  592 F.Supp. at 999) and in its courtroom comments, that it found Dr. Raviv to be highly credible.
 

  When the Court initially ordered the defendants to investigate potential cleanup alternatives, it ordered them to do so “in consultation with an expert to be designated by the plaintiffs, and possibly an additional independent expert to be selected by the Court____”
  
   Id.
  
  at 1009. The later order of this Court denying plaintiffs’ motion for a court appointed expert must be understood in that light; what the Court declined to do was to select the additional independent expert. The expert designated by the plaintiffs, Dr. Raviv, was involved in the remedial action phase by specific order of this Court, and his involvement was not affected by the Court’s later order. In this context, it is apparent that Dr. Raviv was not only a court appointed expert, but he was no longer “plaintiffs’ expert.” Defendants were required by this Court to work with him in developing their plan. Defendants admit, albeit rather grudgingly, that Dr. Raviv did work with them in the development of the plan. Dk. no. 634, p. 5. This Court’s own observation of the development of defendants’ plans (see discussion on Remedial Action Plans
  
   infra,)
  
  convinces it that Dr. Raviv was involved throughout. In fact, the final plan presented to the Court by defendants was largely the result of Dr. Raviv’s suggestions. Defendants suggest that Raviv’s involvement was insignificant in comparison to that of “their” experts, Paul Roux and Leonard Eder. That assertion is doubtless correct, but it is immaterial to the disposition of this issue.
 

  Therefore, as Dr. Raviv was in reality “defendants’ expert” for the purpose of the remedial action phase of this case— that is, he was an expert defendants were required to and did consult in their plan
   
   *339
   
  development — it is not only equitable to require them to pay his fees, but it is to be expected. The Court is convinced that this case, with its unusual post-trial phase which could only benefit the defendants, is one of those unusual circumstances which case law indicates would justify the award of expert fees. The facts of the post-trial activity of this case which the Court has previously detailed clearly suggest that equity would require defendants to pay for plaintiffs’ expert fees for the development and review of defendants’ proposed remedial action plans. But the Court finds that it is not necessary to reach the analysis of whether this case is such a case justifying the unusual award of expert fees against the losing party. Its initial opinion
  
   required
  
  defendants to consult an expert designated by plaintiffs during this phase. It should come as no surprise now that defendants are responsible to pay for the expert consultations which they received. The Court finds that all of Dr. Raviv’s fees and expenses incurred in connection with the post-trial remedial action phase of this suit are properly taxable to the defendants.
 

  The Court notes that plaintiffs’ request for expert fees encompasses more than fees paid to Dr. Raviv. They also seek reimbursement for expenses incurred with the following “experts”: Clarke Well and Equipment, Charles Wilson, Curtis Miller, and John Peck. These appear to make up less than one-fourth of their total requested expert fees, the balance all being fees billed by Dr. Raviv. The Court is not clear what role these other “experts” are alleged to have played in the development of the remedial action phase of this case. Two things are clear to the Court: their use was not initially authorized by the Court (only one expert was, and that clearly has been Dr. Raviv), and since the Court is unaware of what these “experts” even did, it cannot be said that their testimony or activity was indispensable to the resolution of this case. Therefore, the Court finds that none of their fees are properly taxable to the defendants.
 

  Plaintiffs also have requested reimbursement for certain “lab fees” which the Court has characterized as part of their request for expert fees. Their motion does not make clear for what purpose these lab fees were incurred. If they were incurred pursuant to Dr. Raviv’s work with defendants’ experts in developing the plans, then they are properly taxable to the defendants. If they were not so incurred, then they are not taxable to the defendants. Having said that, the Court is constrained to add the qualification that, if any of Dr. Raviv’s fees were incurred for any reason not directly related to the development of the plan, such as testimony in support of one or more of plaintiffs collateral motions, then such fees may not be taxed to the defendants.
 

  In summary, the Court finds that the following costs are properly taxable to the defendants: transcripts, witness fees, copying expenses, postage, long distance telephone expenses, and all fees billed by Dr. Raviv in connection with his work on defendants’ development of a remedial action cleanup plan, including any lab fees related to that work. The following requested costs are not taxable to the defendants: attorneys’ fees, attorneys’ travel expenses, and all expert fees and lab fees not incurred pursuant to Dr. Raviv’s work on defendants’ development of their remedial plans. Because the Court has divided up the allowable and nonallowable expenses in a different fashion than plaintiffs did in their requests, the Court orders that plaintiffs submit within twenty days from the date of this order a revised statement of costs, itemizing all post-trial costs for which the Court has authorized recovery. This statement should include explanation or justification of the purpose for which the fees were incurred, when necessary. Should defendants have any reason within the scope of this order to object to this statement of costs, they may file their objections within ten days of the date of plaintiffs’ filing.
 

  V. REMEDIAL ACTION PLANS
 

  Despite what the lengthy preceding portions of this ruling might suggest, the Court only now comes to the issue for which it retained jurisdiction over this mat
   
   *340
   
  ter: consideration of remedial cleanup alternatives. Because so much time has elapsed since the Court initially ordered the remedial cleanup investigation, and since so many (mostly erroneous) assertions have been made during that time about why the Court made this order, what its intents and purposes were in doing so, and what type of cleanup was envisioned by the Court and the parties
  
   at that time,
  
  the Court will review the context in which this order was made before discussing the development of the case during the remedial phase.
 

  A.
  
   Preliminary Motions
  


  Before the Court can address the question of the remedial action plan, it finds once again that it must first dispose of some procedural motions. This it will do in short order.
 

  1.
  
   Motion to Strike the Affidavit of Elly Triegel
  


  As the Court has mentioned before, the “motion to strike” is a favorite in this case. The Court has typically denied such motions, assuring the parties that because this matter is being tried to the Court, it will be able to dismiss from consideration any impermissible assertions.
 

  This motion is slightly different, though. Plaintiffs move to strike the affidavit submitted by defendants because it deals only with the cleanup, and was filed well beyond the deadline imposed by the Court for filing anything regarding the plans.
  
   See
  
  Dk. no. 655 (Order of the Court dated April 23, 1986 imposing a deadline of May 23, 1986, for filings from either side concerning the remedial cleanup plan, and stressing that no later filings would be considered by the Court). The Court has already held plaintiffs to this order.
  
   See
  
  Dk. no. 668. Defendants do not deny that the affidavit was late (it was filed on July 28, 1986), nor that it deals only with the cleanup. Instead, they rather cavalierly suggest that it is clear that the deadline was not an absolute deadline, and that the Court itself did not even adhere to it (citing an irrelevant example).
 

  The Court’s order meant what it said. The affidavit was filed untimely. In the interests of fairness and impartiality it must be struck. Plaintiffs’ motion is granted.
 

  2.
  
   Motion to Strike Status Report
  


  Another motion to strike. This time plaintiffs seek to strike a status report filed by defendants regarding various projects at the salt plant, on the ground that it includes information plaintiffs should have been given earlier, but were not. If plaintiffs’ assertion is true, the appropriate remedy is not to strike the report. The Court need not discuss this matter further, except to cite it as yet another example indicative of the ongoing disputes between the plaintiffs and the defendants. The motion is denied.
 

  3.
  
   Motion to Preclude Consideration of Non-evidentiary Matters
  


  Defendants move for an order “precluding from consideration as evidence ... the unsworn communication of non-parties, including letters and statements, where the non-parties have not been subject to cross examination ..., to the extent these statements make representations of fact.” Dk. no. 698, p. 1. Defendants’ concern here is with the communications from state agencies which were solicited by the Court. In particular, they seem concerned with an “absurd representation” made in a June 20, 1986 letter from Big Bend. Defendants were especially concerned with their inability to cross examine the Agencies at the June 2, 1986 hearing, to which they objected at the time. Plaintiffs suggest that the defendants are being a bit schizophrenic; on the same day in which defendants filed this motion they filed another motion in which they relied in part upon the testimony of one of the agencies representatives at one of the hearings.
 

  The Court does not find the defendants’ actions as inconsistent as plaintiffs suggest. Defendants are only asking that the communications not be considered
  
   to the extent that they make representations of fact.
  
  The Court certainly did not
   
   *341
   
  solicit the agencies comments so that it could ignore them. But the Court will not consider as evidence any representations by the agencies which goes to the disputed facts of the suit. The Court will consider their submissions solely for the reasons they were solicited: as they relate to the agencies involvement in any proposal before the Court, the agencies’ administration of their own duties and responsibilities imposed by state law, and their technical review of the proposed plans from their standpoint of involvement. The Court does not see the defendants as objecting to consideration of these types of factors, and since the Court is not considering or relying on the Agencies’ representations as to any disputed facts or other than as stated above, the Court concludes that it must be granting defendants motion. Therefore, upon this understanding, defendants’ motion is granted.
 

  B.
  
   Reasons for the Remedial Cleanup Investigation Order
  


  On August 13, 1984, this Court issued its “final ruling” in
  
   Miller v. Cudahy Co.,
  
  592 F.Supp. 976 (D.Kan.1984). The Court found for the plaintiffs, awarded them $3,060,000.00 in actual damages, and $10,-000,000.00 in punitive damages. Evidence had been received at trial in response to a Court inquiry which suggested that a cleanup of the aquifer might be technologically and scientifically feasible. The Court considered that possibility to be the preferable remedy for this matter, and therefore desired to pursue that option.
 

  The Court finds that it would be beneficial to refer to its original Conclusions of Law, from the August 13,1984 Opinion and Order, regarding the Court’s purpose in ordering the defendants to pursue this option.
 

  35. In the further exercise of its equitable jurisdiction, this Court concludes that substantial justice would best be worked between these parties if the defendants could accomplish, at their own expense, the removal of a substantial majority of the salt from the aquifer. The removal of salt from the aquifer would settle the most significant matter in controversy between these parties, restore them to their respective positions before the nuisance was created, and prevent further biannual litigation of the matters of concern in this lawsuit. This Court has the equitable power to order the defendants to undertake such a clean-up.'
 

  36. At the present time, the Court is without sufficient knowledge or information to order the defendants to undertake any particular remedial program. Additional work by competent experts is needed to determine the existence, cost, efficacy, and feasibility of the various clean-up strategies that are or may be available to the defendants____
 

  37. Were defendants to make a conscientious, good-faith, and realistic effort to address and remedy, within a reasonable time, the pollution presently existing in the aquifer, such an effort would be extremely relevant to this Court’s assessment of the defendants’ state of mind and to the appropriateness of the award of punitive damages that this Court has found to be fully justified in this case. In the exercise of its broad equitable powers, this Court concludes that the ends of substantial justice would best be served by holding the final judgment as to the punitive damage award temporarily in abeyance, pending the defendants’ good-faith efforts to define and remedy the pollution they have caused. The Court will retain jurisdiction over this case and the punitive damage award to the fullest extent permitted by law while the clean-up alternatives are investigated and implemented, and may activate by a final judgment the punitive damage award, in whole or in part, at any time that it becomes apparent that the defendants are not pursuing the clean-up effort in good faith, or at any time that it becomes apparent that any clean-up effort is impossible for either scientific or financial reasons.
 


   Id.
  
  at 1007-1008.
 

  Several things are worth noting regarding the Court’s retention of jurisdiction during this remedial action phase. First,
   
   *342
   
  as paragraph 37 makes clear, the Court only retained jurisdiction over the punitive damage award. The fact that the Circuit Court has declined to review the matter until all parts of the case are final does not change the finality, in this Court, of its findings of liability and actual damages. The Court has been frustrated throughout the last half of the this remedial action phase by the defendants’ constant efforts to retry these issues. This Opinion has dealt with this problem previously and will not rehash it here.
 

  Second, the Court retained jurisdiction to allow the development of a remedial action plan for equitable reasons only. The defendants have insinuated that the Court is
  
   obligated
  
  to remit the punitive damages
  
   in whole
  
  if defendants develop and implement
  
   any
  
  cleanup plan. This is a gross mischaracterization of the Court’s order. The Order is clear (paragraph 37) that only a “conscientious, good-faith, and realistic effort” to address the problem would be considered, and that it would only be considered as “relevant to this Court’s assessment of the defendants’ state of mind and to the appropriateness of the award of punitive damages” that the Court had imposed. In short, an appropriate amount of punitives would be remitted only if the Court was convinced, through the development and implementation of a plan, that the defendants’ goodfaith effort to clean up the aquifer which they had polluted demonstrated that the $10,000,000.00 punitive damage award was not justified. Further, the Order is also clear that the Court retained the fullest power over the punitive damage award possible, including the power to activate the punitive damage award
  
   in whole or in part
  
  if it became apparent that the remedial effort was not being pursued in good faith or was not feasible. The Court most definitely did not give the defendants the option of choosing between paying the punitive damage award or implementing a cleanup plan of their choosing.
 

  Third, the concept of a cleanup plan should be viewed in the context of what was envisioned at the time of trial. Brief testimony near the end of the trial was received in response to Court inquiry that cleaning up the aquifer might feasible. Although this possibility was not developed in depth during the trial, it was the understanding of all sides then that such a cleanup could be accomplished in a relatively short period of time. The Court recalls a time span of five to fifteen years. Defendants suggest that the time span then considered was six to twenty years. Dk. no. 577, Vol. 1, p. 3. The difference is not important; all sides agree that the time frame contemplated then was considerably shorter than the ones considered now. In part, the much abbreviated time frame was based on a faulty belief by all sides that, if all pollution ceased, the aquifer would naturally cleanse itself in thirty years. These original time frames have proved to be off by as much as a factor of ten to twenty, as will be discussed below. When interpreting the Court’s initial order, discussions of feasibility must be viewed in the light of what was understood at that time. The Court’s order that the defendants make an effort to remedy the pollution “within a reasonable time,” paragraph 37, must also be understood within this context.
 

  Finally, defendants were required to proceed in good faith. Plaintiffs have suggested to this Court that almost every action which defendants have taken was not in good faith. Although the August 13, 1984 Opinion makes clear that this Court had serious concerns about defendants’ motivations and attitudes, the Court is not prepared to adopt plaintiffs’ sweeping accusations. This does not mean, however, that the Court has been pleased with defendants’ conduct throughout the course of this remedial action phase. The highly contentious spirit between the parties, which at times almost precluded the conduct of orderly and productive hearings, has continued unabated. Fault for this lies on both sides. But as the Court will demonstrate, the defendants’ conduct in the development of the plans proposed and their aggressive use of remedial action investigation to make collateral attacks on the final judgment of this Court are all relevant to good faith, and will be so considered. The Court
   
   *343
   
  will now review the development of the remedial action plans which were presented to this Court in light of the reasons for which the remedial action stage of this case was originally ordered.
 

  C.
  
   Development of the Remedial Action Plans
  


  1.
  
   200 Year Plan
  


  The Court's August 13, 1984 Order required the defendants to begin investigation of cleanup alternatives and to present their final report on the available cleanup alternatives within eight months.
  
   Miller,
  
  592 F.Supp. at 1009. A status conference was held the following month to determine some parameters and guidelines for the conduct of the investigation, but thereafter the Court’s involvement inthe ongoing investigation was basically limited to granting the defendants additional time in which to present their final report. Because of this limited involvement, the Court was unprepared for the proposal which defendants filed on November 20, 1985. This “Proposed Remedial Action Plan for the Cow Creek Aquifer” was a four volume report consisting of a proposed remedial action plan and seven appendices. Dk. no. 577. For obvious reasons, the Court is forced to summarize the report, and for purposes of the developing history of the series of plans which were to be filed, the Court can summarize this report by extracting one sentence from it: “We now know that the length of time and the costs required to remediate the Cow Creek Aquifer are much greater than previously thought.” Dk. no. 577, Yol. 1, p. 2. “Much greater” indeed, for as the Court was shocked to learn, the defendants were proposing a plan whose duration was two hundred years! For the Court, which was still thinking in terms of the five to fifteen years envisioned at trial, this proposal of a plan entirely as long as the history of this nation’s constitution was stunning.
 

  In fairness to the defendants, the reason for the multiplication of plan length should be explained. The investigation revealed two aspects of the aquifer which were significantly different than originally thought. First, because the recharge rate of the aquifer was less than originally thought, see
  
   supra
  
  discussion on New Trial, the rate at which water may be safely withdrawn from the aquifer, as established by the Big Bend Groundwater Management District, was relatively small. Being able to withdraw less water from the aquifer increased the time it would take to clean the aquifer. Big Bend later informed the Court that it would permit the maximum rate to be exceeded for purposes of a cleanup. As it explained, damage to the aquifer by “draw-down” (excessive lowering of the water table in the aquifer due to withdrawing too much water) was significant only as it related to the inability of the aquifer water to be put to beneficial use; but in its polluted state, the water had no beneficial use.
 

  The second way in which the aquifer differed from what was originally believed is much more significant. The defendants’ investigation discovered that removal plans and indicators must be built around sodium rather than chloride. The determinative factor was the sodium adsorption ratio [SAR], which the Court has discussed briefly earlier.
  
   See supra
  
  III. New Trial. An SAR reading of seven is the maximum level at which irrigation can safely proceed. The aquifer had incredibly high SAR readings, particularly in the center of the plume. The SAR levels revealed by testing were so inconsistent, both between wells and at individual wells at varying times, as to preclude giving any meaningful average or norm of SAR levels in the aquifer. Defendants’ report lists the various readings at the various test wells. Dk. no. 577, Vol. 1, Part C, Attachment C-l.
 

  What makes the SAR such a problem is that absorption of sodium onto the clay particles in the soil causes the rate of sodium removal to lag behind the rate of chloride removal. Put simply, the chlorides in the water can be removed by withdrawing the chloride-contaminated water from the aquifer and either purifying it for reinjection into the aquifer, or disposing of it to allow pure water to naturally recharge the aquifer. But once the chloride-contaminated water is removed, the chlorides are
   
   *344
   
  also removed. Sodium, on the other hand, attaches itself to the clay particles in the soil surrounding the aquifer. Therefore, if all of the sodium-contaminated water is theoretically removed from the aquifer, sodium will still remain in the clay. Then, when pure water recharges the aquifer, this sodium will repollute the water. One witness compared it to rinsing out a soapy sponge in a clean bucket of water: one can fully saturate the sponge and then squeeze it dry, but soap still remains. It takes two or three “squeezes” to rinse the soap out. Sodium works in a similar fashion. Defendants’ experts predicted it would take two or three “rinses” to remove sufficient sodium from the aquifer to lower the SAR of the water to seven.
 

  Because of the combination of these factors, defendants estimated that the time necessary for the aquifer to naturally clear itself was 190 to 240 years, rather than the 20 to 30 estimated at trial. Defendants also estimated that, as a result of these factors, the costs of remedial measures to accelerate the remediation process to within less than 30 years would be between $11,000,000.00 and $34,000,000.00 in capital costs, with annual operating costs of $2,300,000.00 to $9,700,000.00. Even then, defendants ominously intoned, there was “no technical assurance or previous experience to indicate that, in practice, these systems would meet their design targets or that the theoretical acceleration in remediation time could be achieved.” Dk. no. 577, Yol 1, p. 4.
 

  In light of these dire warnings, defendants then unveiled their plan. Briefly put, the plan involved five steps: 1) eliminate potential sources of contamination; 2) control the further spread of contamination; 3) establish an ongoing monitoring program; 4) provide fresh drinking water supplies to the affected homeowner population; and 5) compensate landowners who cannot obtain irrigation water from their land because of the salt pollution. The upshot of the proposed plan was that it only intercepted polluted water to prevent it from moving downstream. Defendants described it as being “designed to establish barrier interceptor systems across the entire plume at four locations.” Dk. no. 644, p. A-l. The plan disposed of this water rather than purifying it and returning it to the aquifer. It did nothing to clean up the existing polluted areas. It was more of a “containment” plan than a cleanup plan. Defendants calculated the present value cost of this plan to be $3,456,000.00. The plan would take 200 years to implement. Because of that, this plan came to be known as the “200 year plan,” or, as other plans were later designed from it, the “Base plan.” Testimony was also offered that it would take the aquifer 300 years to naturally clean itself.
 

  Defendants did present various “Acceleration Alternatives” to the proposed 200 year plan. These ranged from accelerating the cleanup to 67 years, at an
  
   added
  
  present value cost of $1,686,000.00, to accelerating the cleanup to 5 years, at an
  
   added
  
  present value cost of $71,030,000.00. Defendants compared these costs to the differential market value of the land in its non-irrigable state and, not surprisingly, recommended that none of the accelerated alternatives be imposed. Instead, they recommended a one-time compensation to the landowners for their inability to irrigate.
 

  It would be an understatement to say that defendants’ proposed 200 year plan did not receive a warm reception. Plaintiffs filed a lengthy “Observations and Objections to the Cleanup Plan,” Dk. no. 590. Therein they objected that this plan did not address the issue of providing fresh water to the plaintiffs, protesting that they needed salt removed from the water, not water removed because it was salty. They objected because this plan would significantly reduce the water flowing towards them, thereby providing even less water to flush out the pollution below plaintiffs’ lands. They characterized the plan as not a cleanup, but merely a proposal to change an underground polluted stream into an underground polluted, stagnant lake. Finally, plaintiffs objected, as did the Court, to defendants’ presuming to substitute their own standards of damages for the Court’s, via their proposal to pay plaintiffs the differential of the value of non-irrigable land
   
   *345
   
  to irrigable land. Presumably, this was tied with defendants’ suggestion that the ten million punitive damages award be replaced by the three million dollar plan, plus this differential; a proposition which the defendants would no doubt prefer.
 

  The hearing held on this proposal on January 16 and 17, 1986, further underscored the hostile reaction to this 200 year plan. Plaintiffs may be forgiven for their bitter sarcasm at that hearing. The Court itself questioned whether anything which would take 200 years could realistically be called a “plan.” Plaintiffs’ expert, Dr. Dan Raviv, suggested the the cleanup be approached solely from the view of cleaning up chlorides to an acceptable 250 ppm level, and suggested the placement of additional wells. Defendants’ experts, Mr. Leonard Eder and Mr. Paul Roux, informed the Court that the Base plan, if operated solely to clean up chlorides rather than being concerned with sodium, could reduce the chloride level in the aquifer to 250 ppm within 100 years. This became known as the “100 year plan.” Roux and Eder further agreed to work with Raviv on his additional wells proposal, and requested thirty days to do so. Another hearing was set for February.
 

  2.
  
   February Modifications to the Plan
  


  Another hearing was held February 18 through 21, 1986. Defendants presented their modifications to the Base plan to incorporate the chlorides-only approach. They first informed the Court that their data suggested it would take the aquifer 180 years to naturally clear itself to the maximum acceptable chloride concentration of 250 ppm.
 

  Defendants presented two modifications to the plans. The first modification reduced the total remediation time by fifty percent at an additional cost of only ten percent above the Base plan (here, the Base plan refers to the 100 year plan, not the 200 year plan, since sodium was not being considered). This first modification will be referred to as the “50 year plan.” The reduction in remediation time was accomplished by “moving wells” as certain areas cleared; that is, reducing the pumping volume of wells in certain areas and drilling new wells in other areas to increase the rapidity of their cleanup, all the while staying within the maximum pumping rate from the aquifer that the drawdown and recharge rate would allow. The plan estimated that the first phase of cleanup would last 15 years, and thereafter wells could be “moved” or newly drilled to the other areas for a second phase, estimated to take 35 years. During this phase, pumping would continue in the original areas, but at a reduced rate. This plan was now the “recommended plan” by American Salt; and although there were more plans to come, it would remain their recommended plan throughout the duration of the remedial action hearings.
 

  The second modification provided further acceleration of the remedial plan by adding an additional well immediately into the area where the new wells would be drilled in the second phase of the 50 year plan. The plan would then proceed largely as the 50 year plan would, but because of the additional well, the cleanup time for the second phase would be reduced from 35 to 17 years, creating a total estimated cleanup time of 32 years. Defendants and their experts did not recommend the “32 year plan” because of their concern that its accelerated pumping “would probably stress the aquifer and cause significant drawdowns in some areas and may change Cow Creek from a gaming to a losing stream.” Dk. no. 644, p. C-l. It was also not recommended because the cost/benefit ratio was considered unacceptable. They characterized this plan as an aggressive, risky plan. Defendants did find the 32 year plan acceptable from an environmental and technical standpoint.
 

  Defendants also presented to the Court their calculations of the various plans’ costs, in present value. The 100 year plan was estimated to cost $3,455 million, the 50 year plan to cost $3,717 million, and the 32 year plan $4,489 million. Costs were represented to be accurate only within ten percent. The lengths of the plans were also represented to be only estimates, which could vary considerably once actually put into effect.
 

 
   *346
   
  Defendants apparently developed these two modifications on the very eve of the hearing. Plaintiffs complained that they were unprepared to adequately address these plans because defendants had told them as recently as the Friday before the Tuesday hearing that they were still recommending the Base plan. Defendants’ experts admitted that the two modifications were pulled together over the weekend, portions of them as late as Monday evening. They testified that this was done because defendants’ attorneys were reluctant to stick with the Base plan, due to their feeling that the Court had been “disappointed” with the time span. The Court was concerned about the potential last minute sandbagging of the plaintiffs by this surprise move, but over the course of the highly contentious four day hearing grew less concerned that plaintiffs were actually harmed by defendants’ midnight hour strategy. However, the timing of this did raise some concerns in the Court’s mind regarding defendants’ “good faith.”
 

  In the course of the hearing Ron Nugent, President of American Salt, testified that the company was committed to a cleanup regardless of the outcome of the suit. In response to the Court’s question, he assured the Court that he spoke not only for American Salt, but was authorized to speak for the parent company as well.
 

  Plaintiffs’ expert, Dr. Dan Raviv, presented his evaluation of the plans to the Court. Raviv expressed some concerns with defendants’ plans, and detailed a few shortcomings he saw. He testified that he was surprised to show up in court and see the 32 year plan presented, but he found that plan very positive. Raviv sketched out a few modifications he would suggest to the 32 year plan. Roux and Eder requested an additional thirty-five to forty days to review these with him, and then present the modification to the Court. Another hearing was set for April.
 

  3.
  
   The Ten Interceptor Well Plan
  


  On April 14, 1986, one week before the next scheduled status conference, defendants filled a detailed description of the “Ten Interceptor Well Plan.” Dk. no. 644. This plan was presented in written form with detailed descriptions and supporting data (similar to the defendants’ original Base plan and unlike the 50 year plan and the 32 year plan, which were prepared overnight). This plan is in essence a modified 32 year plan. Although defendants’ experts prepared and presented this plan, it was the product of Raviv’s suggestions made at the February hearing. Defendants represented this plan to be environmentally sound and technically feasible, but not cost effective. Therefore, they did not and do not recommend this plan; their recommendation continued to be the 50 year plan.
 

  This plan still addressed only the necessary remedial action to reduce chlorides to 250 ppm, and did not address the sodium problem. The major change in this plan was that a larger number of lower volume wells is used. Separate provisions for potable water were still included, since this plan, like all of the plans, is most accurately characterized as a modification of the Base plan. Defendants estimated that the cost of this plan would be $4.8 million. Costs for the 100 year, 50 year, and 32 year plans were revised.
 

  Throughout the course of the hearings, state agencies who had oversight responsibility for the water in the aquifer and/or the pollution there had attended and closely monitored the progress of the plans. These agencies were the Kansas Department of Health and Environment [KDHE], the Big Bend Groundwater Management District [Big Bend] and the Kansas State Board of Agriculture’s Division of Water Resources [DWR] [hereinafter collectively referred to as the Agencies]. The Court was aware and appreciative of the Agencies attentiveness, and had invited them to inform the Court in writing of their reactions to the proposal that defendants would file. On the day of the status conference, both KDHE and Big Bend, as well as the plaintiffs and their expert Raviv, presented the Court with written reactions to the Ten Interceptor Well Plan.
 

 
   *347
   
  The status conference was held on April 21, 1986. Defendants’ experts, Roux and Eder, presented the Ten Interceptor Well Plan and the 50 year plan in detail, explaining how they would work. Roux represented that there were only three areas of major disagreement remaining between the experts: the question of whether the 50 year plan or the Ten Interceptor Well Plan was better, disagreements over who should monitor and administer the remedial cleanup, and a technical dispute over a disposal well. Defendants estimated that the Ten Interceptor Well Plan would take 35 to 50 years to complete.
 

  In his written comments and in his testimony, Raviv expressed various technical concerns and administrative, reporting recommendations. Defendants had recommended that KDHE administer the plan. Raviv objected to the term “administer” and requested guidelines from the Court as to who would oversee and control the operation of the remedial action. He also objected to the defendants’ calculation of the cost of the Ten Interceptor Well Plan. Defendants represented that, of the $4.8 million figure they projected, $1,713 million had already been spent. Raviv protested that the figure of monies already spent included costs for site investigation and some plant modification; expenses which were not relevant to the remedial action.
 

  In its review of the Ten Interceptor Well Plan, KDHE initially presented to the Court the state’s interest in the cleanup of the polluted aquifer, noting that “[gjroundwater in Kansas represents a limited and highly valuable resource to the State.” Dk. no. 648, p. 1. It voiced an initial concern that, while the 250 ppm chloride standard adopted by the parties was satisfactory, attention should also be given to the sodium content. KDHE suggested that sodium should be monitored, and desired to see the sodium content lowered to a maximum of 100 ppm. It further provided a valuable technical critique of plan particulars. Concern was also expressed about sources of continuing pollution, especially from the settling pond in the brine fields. The Court had found the brine fields to be a source of pollution in its August 13, 1984 opinion, but the defendants had stoutly contested that finding throughout the course of the remedial hearings. While KDHE was the state agency with primary responsibility for a pollution problem such as this one, it made clear its desire to cooperate with the Court as fully as possible: “KDHE does not want, in the interest of environmental protection, to initiate any unilateral actions which could conflict with the Court’s orders. To achieve this objective, KDHE is willing to supervise the cleanup plan, to require modifications as warranted, and to institute such enforcement actions as necessary.” Dk. no. 648, p. 6.
 

  Big Bend’s comments to the Court were more in the nature of expressions of concern by local people involved with water management than a technical review. Big Bend was concerned with who would evaluate the results of monitoring to determine if the plan was working, or if it needed modifications. It asked the Court to retain jurisdiction over any cleanup, something the Court was unwilling to do due to the length of any proposed plan. Big Bend also was concerned that American Salt understand that its interceptor well at the edge of its property, which was designed to intercept any brine in the aquifer before it went onto private property, was not “a license to continue to pollute the aquifer beneath their property.” Dk. no. 649, p. 1.
 

  While Dr. Raviv, plaintiffs’ expert, was increasingly concurring in the direction defendants’ plans were taking, the plaintiffs were not so content. In their written comments to the Court, they expressed their frustration with defendants’ ever changing representations of what they were willing to do, while nothing productive was happening. They did have concerns with the Ten Interceptor Well Plan, mostly related to monitoring and administration. They were understandably concerned about defendants being solely in charge of the administration of any plan, and asked that an independent body be appointed. In the final analysis, though, plaintiffs were frustrated with the continual delays and the increasing complexity of any remedial ac

  tion. They were beginning to favor asking the Court to abandon any attempt at a Court-ordered cleanup and to just enter final judgment, a change from their original position.

   Finalization of the Proposed Remedial Action Plan
  


  At this point, the Court finally had before it a detailed plan which seemed feasible and which had a chance of being acceptable to all sides. The Court had several remaining concerns with the proposed Ten Interceptor Well Plan, though. Like KDHE, the Court was concerned about ignoring the sodium factor. This was being done at plaintiffs’ suggestion, but the Court had not expressed its approval of that development; a cleanup that leaves considerable sodium pollution is not a cleanup. But the Court did not view this as a major impediment to plan development; earlier testimony had indicated that the remedial action to clean up the chlorides could also clean up sodium, although it might take longer.
 

  This raised a second concern to the Court. When this remedial phase of the case was initially embarked upon, all sides envisioned that a cleanup could occur within approximately five to fifteen years. Had the Court known then that any cleanup would take decades (if not centuries), it is highly unlikely that this phase would have been embarked upon. Since the Court now found itself in the midst of plan development, it was willing to proceed to the finish in the hopes of arriving at a practical solution. But it was becoming increasingly apparent to the Court that
  
   any
  
  remedial cleanup could not occur under the jurisdiction of the Court. Courts are not functionally capable of overseeing something of such duration. Therefore, the Court was increasingly devoting its attention to the question of what or who would administer and oversee any remedial action. In comments received on the Ten Interceptor Well Plan, plaintiffs, Big Bend, Dr. Raviv and KDHE had all addressed this issue.
 

  Before the Court addressed this issue, though, it decided to determine if the proposed Ten Interceptor Well Plan was in fact technically feasible. If not, the other questions evaporated; if so, they could then be addressed. The Agencies had submitted written comments to the Court on the proposed plan, but had all indicated that the brevity of time had precluded a full technical review. The Court therefore requested that the Agencies compare and fully review the Ten Interceptor Well Plan and the 50 year plan for practicality and feasibility. The Court did not presume to exercise any jurisdiction over these Agencies, and therefore did not order them to do so, but only requested them to conduct such a review if they were willing. The Court did order defendants to provide the Agencies with all necessary data to make such a review. A hearing was scheduled for June, at which time the Court instructed the parties that it and not the attorneys would ask the questions. The Court brushed aside “due process” protests to this by informing the parties that, in its opinion, this ten year old case had been “due processed to death.” Although the Court had originally indicated that it would allow the attorneys to cross examine the representatives of the Agencies as they presented their reviews at that hearing, the Court later changed its mind and instructed all sides that since the Agencies were merely following their state regulatory responsibilities, and were presenting their reviews at the bequest of the Court, inquiry would be made only by the Court.
 

  The Court received the Agencies’ written reviews the last week of May, and the hearing was held on June 2, 1986. The Agencies found both plans to be feasible, but because the Ten Interceptor Well Plan allowed for accelerated cleanup without significant drawdown to the aquifer, and because it gave immediate attention to all areas of the plume, they recommended the Ten Interceptor Well Plan over the 50 year plan. Other technical suggestions were made, but as KDHE explained, there was little purpose in fine tuning the plans further due to the inherent uncertainties in any undertaking of this nature.
 

 
   *349
   
  Two significant concerns, paralleling the Court’s concerns, were also expressed. The sodium pollution in the aquifer continued to concern the Agencies, but they suggested that monitoring for both chlorides and sodium and administering the plan accordingly could resolve that problem. The administration itself was the other concern. Suggestions were made for independent monitoring. Big Bend suggested the formal creation of a decision-making task force composed of representatives from Big Bend, KDHE, DWR, the affected landowners and American Salt. This mirrored exactly the Court’s thinking on this issue.
 

  The Court conducted a hearing on June 2, 1986, at which the parties and the state agencies answered questions put to them from the bench. No formal presentation of evidence, receipt of testimony, or conduct of examinations and cross-examinations by the parties were allowed. Because the plaintiffs had expressed increasing frustration with the development of the plans, the Court first inquired of them whether they still wanted the aquifer cleanedup as a part of the judgment. Plaintiffs represented that they did, but they wanted it to happen within fifteen years as originally envisioned. They complained that within 35 to 50 years they would all be dead, and as one landowner had earlier said, “I don’t consider any cleanup that doesn’t happen in my lifetime to be a cleanup.” The plaintiffs were also concerned because the indications were that American Salt was still polluting the environment with salt. Any cleanup effort was worthless as long as that continued, because no progress could be made. So, while they still favored a cleanup, at least in a theoretical sense, they were growing increasingly skeptical.
 

  Their concerns about the protracted nature of these proceedings while nothing constructive was happening (concerns shared by the Court) were not helped by the defendants’ opening comments that they were prepared to implement whatever plan the Court ordered “subject to its appeal rights and perhaps a stay pending it.” Transcript of June 2, 1986 hearing, p. 10. This suggestion of a stay of cleanup pending appeal(s) did not assure the Court that defendants’ earlier representations of their willingness to clean up the aquifer “regardless of the outcome of the suit” were in good faith.
 

  The plaintiffs raised the issue of being compensated for the monitor and intercept wells that would be placed on their property, much as payments are made for similar oil lease wells. They also wanted guarantees of damage payments in case these wells leaked, or if their land were otherwise damaged due to the presence and servicing of the wells.
 

  This again raised the issue of plan administration. An entity was needed which could not only authorize modifications in the ongoing remedial action, but could also authorize payments from the funds which the Court would require defendants to post as a financial guarantee that the plan could be completed. Already, disagreements had arisen over what expenses should be considered as costs of the remediation as opposed to expenses which American Salt should have to pay as a natural part of their plant operation (see Dr. Raviv’s comments on the estimated cost of the Ten Interceptor Well Plan,
  
   supra).
  
  Such an entity would also have to serve as a “referee” between the salt company and the landowners for disputes that would inevitably arise. KDHE represented to the Court that, while it was willing to receive input from such an entity, it was reluctant for policy reasons to sit on any board that made decisions about allocating funds. While it understood that any order the Court would make would specifically reserve to the Agencies their full statutory authority, it preferred to avoid any financial responsibility and stay solely with its regulatory authority. Big Bend was willing to designate someone to set on such a board, but DWR, after initially expressing its willingness, decided that KDHE’s position was a more realistic one for them. Plaintiffs informed the Court that if American Salt was in control of administration, they would prefer to forget the plan entirely and to take the judgment; they had encountered too many problems in dealing
   
   *350
   
  with American Salt in the past to want to face it for another 35 to 50 years.
 

  This issue, then, had developed into a major stumbling block to the implementation of any plan. Because the issue was a new one, the Court again ordered the parties, and requested the Agencies, to brief it regarding their suggestions as to oversight of a remedial action cleanup plan. The Court explained the problem in its order of May 6, 1986:
 

  Specifically, the Court is concerned about oversight of a remedial action cleanup plan which has gone through a receding time span, but which by the most optimistic projections will still take a third of a century to complete. The Court has said in the past, and reaffirms now, that continuing jurisdiction in the United States District Court for the District of Kansas is
  
   not
  
  the solution, is judicially unsupportable, and will not be considered. Yet the Court easily discerns that ongoing problems will develop should a plan be ordered and implemented, and the Court recognizes that a mechanism for resolving such disputes
  
   must
  
  exist. Should no clear, defined and effective dispute resolution mechanism exist, one which all sides agree should govern the ongoing operations and is acceptable to the Court, this Court is convinced that ordering a cleanup would be a futile effort. In such a case, the Court would not order that a cleanup plan be implemented.
 

  Such a mechanism should be empowered to approve modifications or changes in the plan as technical or environmental developments may dictate. It should be entrusted with financial oversight to approve expenditures from funds bonded for the cleanup operation. It should be capable of satisfactorily resolving any disputes that may arise, such as disputes between the landowners on whose property drilling must occur and the engineering or drilling firms who engage in the mechanics of a cleanup operation. Additionally, the Court believes that it should have input from the affected landowners, the salt company, and all of the affected state regulatory agencies. This would provide it with both a balanced approach and with the technical input needed to make the necessary decisions regarding the cleanup. Finally, and in the Court’s opinion most importantly, it should not be controlled by either the salt company, the landowners, or the operators who do the work necessary for cleanup. Although participation by all of these may be, and probably is, essential; allowing any one of them to control the ongoing oversight would destroy the necessary impartiality that an equitable solution to this matter requires.
 

  Unfortunately, the Court discovered during the course of the June 2 hearing that a Pandora’s box of problems was opened by the discussion of this phase of any cleanup operation. At the outset, the Court would state unequivocally that it disagrees with defendants’ representations that this is a “non-problem.” The course of this case and the nature of the undertaking clearly show that someone or something must exist which can neutrally control the cleanup’s development and address disputes and disagreements which will inevitably arise. The Court learned on June 2 that the construction of this “someone or something” was not a simple matter. The state agencies, with the exception of [Big Bend], were reluctant to be involved in such oversight that would be separate from their legally imposed regulatory responsibilities____ Plaintiffs expressed opposition to involvement by American Salt in any fashion. American Salt, conversely, was opposed to surrendering control of any mechanism that would impact their plant operations. In short, nothing approaching consensus developed at the hearing in this regard. As has already been said, the Court is persuaded that its approval of a remedial action cleanup plan without some form of a neutral oversight entity would be an empty gesture. In light of the extensive time that has been devoted to this matter, the Court would regret to see it collapse at this late date. Therefore, this final attempt is made to resolve the problem.
 

  Dk. no. 674.
 

  Simultaneous filings were ordered from the parties and the Agencies. Plaintiffs
   
   *351
   
  suggested an entity similar to the one which the Court had proposed, but were somewhat stymied by the refusal of the Agencies to participate. They suggested that an independent arbitration panel could be used. Defendants suggested that KDHE, as the regulatory agency in the state with oversight in this area, should be given full authority to conduct any remedial action. They also suggested independent arbitrators for settling any other disputes, and suggested that, “the histrionics of plaintiffs’ counsel” notwithstanding, the company and most of the landowners had been able to satisfactorily resolve problems themselves throughout the course of this phase. Dk. no. 679, p. 13. A written arbitration agreement was proposed. Big Bend indicated its willingness to oversee both technical and financial aspects of the remediation process. Both DWR and KDHE restated their statutory authority, but demurred from being involved in any financial or dispute resolution decisions.
 

  The Court had previously shut off future filings from the parties regarding the proposed plans. With the receipt of the above comments, the Court’s file was therefore complete, and it took the matter of remedial action under advisement.

   Court’s Analysis of the Proposed Remedial Action Plan
  


  Attempts by the Judges of this District to impose equitable remedies going beyond the mere award of money have met with criticism.

   Miller
  
  was' a trial to the Court, not to a jury, so no seventh amendment questions were involved. The remedial action required by the Court was not a modification of the initial judgment in the case, but a part of that judgment. The actions proposed by the Court, by which the defendants potentially might obtain some relief from the punitive damages, would have required significant effort and a considerable expenditure of funds which would be comparable to the punitive damages. Moreover, the actions proposed went to the nature of relief plaintiffs were seeking, and were consistent with the relief requested. Significantly, plaintiffs themselves favored this attempt — the proposal was not made over their objections but with their support. In light of these factors, it made sense for the Court to attempt to fashion a remedy which truly rectified the wrong, not merely compensated for it.
 

  While the plaintiffs did support this proposal (the Court would not have pursued it without their support), it should be remembered that it was the Court itself which initially suggested the remedial cleanup. This Court desired to see a remedy fashioned which would, as much as possible, restore the environment to its pre-polluted state. It was willing, even eager, to use its equitable powers to bring about that result. This remedial action phase was not envisioned or embarked upon to trick defendants or to delay plaintiffs’ recovery; it was done because the Court was willing to try to use its powers to right the wrong.
 

  And the Court has tried. It has assiduously and conscientiously exerted every judicial effort. It has put as much effort into the post-trial phase of this case as it did in the pre-trial phase. It has read thousands of pages of documents and sat through endless hours of hearings in an attempt to reach the final goal of a feasible, Court-ordered remedial cleanup plan. It has constantly gone back to the parties (and the Agencies) to try one more time to work out the problems which prevented it from ordering a cleanup. And it has spent a considerable amount of time inchambers studying the submissions and discussing numerous alternatives with its staff in an attempt to find a workable solution. But the Court has concluded that, for this matter, no feasible court implemented cleanup plan can be found. Therefore, the Court now sadly abandons its attempt to fashion an equitable remedy and rejects all proposed plans.
 

 
   *352
   
  The Court finds several problems with the proposals before it. First, they do not address the sodium pollution in the aquifer. It has clearly been established throughout the course of these hearings that the maximum sodium content at which water is fit for irrigation is far below the sodium level in this aquifer. It has also been clearly established that a sodium cleanup will take substantially longer than a chloride cleanup. The proposals for cleaning up chlorides are also technically sufficient to clean up sodium. But the plans must he operated significantly longer to clean up the sodium than they would need to be if only chlorides were cleaned up. This is why the Court, although not approving of the plaintiffs’ suggestion to disregard sodium in a cleanup calculation, nevertheless allowed the plan developments to proceed; the Court knew that all plans were technically capable of removing both compounds from the water, and decided in the interest of keeping the controversy at the hearings to a minimum not to interfere with the parties’ accommodation in this matter. Then, after an acceptable plan was developed, if ever, the sodium could be factored back in to determine a true plan length.
 

  But when sodium is factored back in to the plans now before the Court, the time length arrived at is astounding. The chief problem with sodium is not that the plans are incapable of cleaning it up, it is that the plans will require a great amount of time to do so. Thus, the Ten Interceptor Well Plan, the favored plan before the Court, must be viewed not in terms of the 35-50 years suggested, but more in terms of 75-150 years. Even 35 years is too long for a Court to oversee remedial action; but when the plans are viewed in terms of what would really be required to effectuate a cleanup of the pollution, the length of time clearly becomes impossible.
 

  It should not be thought that the Court is adverse to retaining jurisdiction to oversee implementation of remedial action. Recently, while this Opinion was being drafted, the Court ordered a remedial plan to be developed and implemented under its supervision in another matter.
  
   Reece v. Gragg,
  
  650 F.Supp. 1297 (D.Kan.1986) (county jail facility found unconstitutional; continued operation allowed only upon certain enumerated conditions, including the development by the county of an acceptable proposal to bring its jail facilities within constitutional parameters). The Court is at this very moment overseeing the development of that plan.
 

  But a remedial action of the type envisioned in
  
   Reece,
  
  or of the type originally envisioned in this case, is not of such a long duration that it cannot effectively be managed by the Court.
  
   Reece
  
  at the longest should not involve this Court for over three years. When the Court embarked upon this adventure, it expected that a cleanup could be accomplished in five years. But a proposal which will, at a minimum, take 35-50 years, and in all probability two to three times as long, is a horse of a different color. No judicial precedent exists for retaining jurisdiction over a case for that length of time. Common sense dictates against it. The prospect of the Court attempting to oversee a matter of this duration is frightening. Even were he a much younger man, and had hopes of surviving the course of such a proposal, the Court would cringe at the specter of ongoing oversight of a matter predicted to last that long. Indeed, it is doubtful that retaining jurisdiction for that length of time can be legally supported. In this age of burgeoning and complex litigation, courts are not equipped to exercise continuing judicial supervision for decades. Litigation was not meant to be passed from one judge to other, succeeding, judges over long periods of time.
 

  Therefore, the Court was required to look beyond itself for an administrative oversight authority. This is where the second problem arises. KDHE was willing to provide technical oversight, but no acceptable proposal for financial oversight could be developed. The rationale behind a court-ordered cleanup plan was that defendants could obtain some relief from the punitive damages for it. But if the Court were to give any credit to the defendants against the punitive damages, it would require defendants to bond the cost of the
   
   *353
   
  remedial action plan initially. Once funds were bonded, the cost of the cleanup could be paid from them. But who would determine what was properly payable from the bonded monies as opposed to from the coffers of American Salt? Already, disputes have arisen over what costs are properly allocable to the plan, with plaintiffs’ expert opposing defendants’ attempt to charge nearly two million dollars of expenses already incurred against the plan cost. It does not take a crystal ball to see that disputes of this nature would be likely to continue to rise. In its order of May 6, 1986, quoted above, the Court explained that ordering the implementation of a plan without resolving this question would be futile. Unfortunately, the question was never resolved.
 

  Defendants have never understood the importance of this factor to a Court-ordered plan. They asserted that KDHE could simply administer the entire thing. Indeed, it should be mentioned at this point that, only one month ago, KDHE, pursuant to its statutory responsibilities, entered into a signed agreement with American Salt and its parent corporation, AMS Industries, Inc. (formerly Cudahy Company), requiring a cleanup of the aquifer along the lines of the Ten Interceptor Well Plan proposed to this Court. The Court would not wish to belittle the importance of this agreement. By signing it, defendants have made significant admissions, particularly in paragraph 9 of the Findings of Fact which reads in part: “[t]his pollution has been caused substantially by the operations of the Lyons Plant by American Salt, AMS, and their predecessors in interest at various times since 1908.” The Court does not foresee that KDHE’s administration of this consent order will encounter the same difficulties that concerned the Court. The technical concerns in an undertaking of this nature are myriad, and as the cleanup plan is developed and implemented those concerns are sure to multiply. An administrative agency such as KDHE is designed to handle such a situation, while it would be at best difficult for a judicial body to deal with it. More importantly, KDHE has ordered this cleanup solely out of environmental concerns. It is not concerned with offsetting punitive damages, so it does not need to worry about which plan costs should be setoff from a sum certain. It merely requires American Salt to pay for all cleanup costs of whatever nature, and requires AMS to guarantee payment of these expenses in the event that American Salt does not or cannot pay them. Its task is accordingly much simpler than the Court’s self-imposed task would have been.
 

  The Court wishes to make clear that KDHE’s implementation of this order was neither a surprise to the Court nor a unilateral action taken by it against the Court’s wishes. As this Opinion has explained earlier, throughout the remedial phase of this case — a phase which KDHE has closely followed — KDHE has consistently assured the Court that it did not wish to interfere or preempt the Court’s actions in any way. From the conversations that the Court had with KDHE, it appeared that KDHE would have issued such an order earlier than it did had it not been stepping aside out of respect to this Court’s continuing jurisdiction in the matter. It appears that such a sweeping order was not entered into years ago in part because KDHE did not discover the full extent of the problem until the trial in this case revealed it. But after being apprised of the facts of the pollution, it has been ready to take action.
 

  After the filings and hearing were concluded in this matter, KDHE informed the Court that it had decided that the Ten Interceptor Well Plan best addressed the pollution problem. It then privately notified the Court that it wished to enter an order along those lines under its own authority as the state agency with jurisdiction over environmental matters. But it also informed the Court that it would delay entering such an order if requested to do so by the Court. Because this Court has not wanted to appear to be exercising any jurisdiction over the state agencies, and because it was clear by then to the Court that, if the other details could be worked out and any plan were implemented, it would be the Ten Interceptor Well Plan, the Court did not ask KDHE to refrain
   
   *354
   
  from action. It is important to understand that the Court did not ask KDHE to act either. KDHE operated independently, and with deference to this Court.
 

  In light of KDHE’s actions, defendants can be expected to ask the Court to merely incorporate KDHE’s order as its own. But, as explained, the Court has concerns not addressed by KDHE’s order. That a state regulatory agency, on its own initiative and under its own authority, takes such action does not resolve the matter before this Court. The Court therefore is unable to simply incorporate KDHE’s order as its own.
 

  Although defendants’ agreement with KDHE is technically outside the scope of this suit, the question nonetheless arises whether their agreement with KDHE to clean up the aquifer does not call for some relief from the punitive damage award. The Court has seriously considered this question, separate and apart from the context of this case. The Court fully expects defendants to argue that since they have agreed to do in essence what the Court originally sought to have done — clean up the aquifer — the Court is
  
   obligated
  
  to remit the ten million dollar punitive award. The Court is not so obligated. As should be clear to all, and as defendants themselves have admitted, KDHE had the authority to do exactly what it has done even if the remedial phase of this case had never been embarked upon, indeed, even if this case had never been filed.
  
   See
  
  Transcript of June 2, 1986 hearing, p. 52. Frankly, the Court is pleased that state regulatory action is being taken that may result in the cleanup of the salt pollution. While one might question whether American Salt would have been so willing to enter into such a consent order absent the pressures resulting from this case, the Court will attribute at least some good intent to it on this account.
 

  But the relationship of a 1987 consent order to a 1984 award of punitive damages is tenuous at best. An elementary aspect of punitive damages seems to have been forgotten in this case: they are awarded on account of
  
   past
  
  behavior. If punitive damage awards could be remitted solely due to subsequent conduct, no punitive damages would ever be enforced in any case. Defendants would simply engage in ameliorative behavior until their conduct was deemed sufficient to vacate an award. It does not require a review of the law of punitive damages to show the error of this analysis. Defendants’ conduct may serve to relieve them from future liability for similar offenses, but it does not require that an award based on their past offenses must be set aside.
 

  The Court took the unusual step here of promising to consider remitting the punitive damage award in whole or in part upon the fulfillment of certain conditions by defendants, but they have wholly failed to meet those conditions. They may not substitute their own criteria for the Court’s assessment in this matter. That KDHE may have borrowed from the discoveries and developments in this case is purely fortuitous. KDHE made its order out of environmental concerns, but the Court addresses an unrelated question in its determination of whether the punitive damage award is appropriate. That question involves the Court’s assessment of defendants’ state of mind as determined by their good faith conduct in developing and implementing a remedial action plan.
  
   See Miller,
  
  Conclusion of Law II 37,592 F.Supp. at 1007 (also quoted above in this Opinion). The Court now turns to that assessment.
 

  This assessment addresses two issues: its relationship to the feasibility of a Court-ordered plan and its relationship to the question of whether the punitive damage award is appropriate. As to plan implementation, any remittance of punitive damages in consideration of a Court-ordered plan would require cooperation between plaintiffs and defendants in the ongoing oversight of the plan’s implementation. That the two sides have never gotten along will come as no surprise to anyone who is acquainted even slightly with this matter. Like a weary parent, the Court has continued to hope that an agreement eventually could be reached. Perhaps the Court was naive, for if there has been one constant throughout this case, it has been the con
   
   *355
   
  tentious spirit of the parties. From the first threat of filing this action (where defendants threatened plaintiffs that, if suit were filed, defendants’ attorneys would drag the matter out until plaintiffs were broke and defendants owned their land), to the closing of the last remedial hearing (where both defendants and plaintiffs intimated that they would oppose any plan administration which gave
  
   any
  
  role to the other side), the drama of this case has resembled the Hatfields’ and McCoys’ dispute.
 

  Defendants have suggested that it is the counsel for both sides who are feuding; the parties themselves largely are cooperative. The Court would like to believe this, but it has seen no indication of such harmony. Instead, to cite only one example, it sees incidents like the one occurring on June 18, 1986. On that day, according to letters the Court received from both sides, plaintiffs appeared at the American Salt plant for a prearranged inspection of the plant premise for buried salt. This inspection was arranged as a result of a matter raised by plaintiffs at the February 21, 1986 hearing; it was part of a compromise by which plaintiffs agreed to drop a motion for injunctive relief. Plaintiffs were represented at that inspection by both Cecil Miller and by a law clerk from plaintiffs’ attorneys’ office. Defendants objected that the arrangement allowed for only
  
   one
  
  representative of the plaintiffs to make the inspection, and hard as it is to believe, the tour was delayed for forty-five minutes while this insignificant matter of “one inspector or two” was hotly debated. The law clerk was finally sent away, and Miller alone conducted the inspection. American Salt allowed a representative of KDHE to accompany them, but also prevented a representative of Big Bend from taking the tour, saying a Court order would be required before Big Bend could participate in the inspection.
 

  The law clerk left the premises and went to Miller’s land which adjoined the salt plant to take photographs. In doing so, he apparently overstepped the property line onto American Salt’s land. The plant manager himself gave chase to the clerk, and when he could not apprehend him, had his secretary call the county sheriff’s office to arrest the clerk for trespass. He was so arrested, and given Miranda warnings before he was released. In light of such incidents, it is difficult for the Court to believe that plaintiffs and defendants are coexisting and working together peaceably.
 

  Although, as in any quarrel, fault probably lies on both sides, from the Court’s observations it must conclude that the lion’s share of the fault lies with defendants. Their cavalier and calloused attitude throughout the remedial phase of the suit almost seems to have been designed to antagonize plaintiffs. While they have diligently investigated the aquifer, they have utilized the results of that investigation to attack the Court’s findings of liability and actual damages (issues no longer open) at least as much as they have used them to develop remedial cleanup plans. This misuse is relevant to their “good faith.""
 

  In developing cleanup plans, they initially concluded their fourteen month investigation with a report to the Court that the only feasible and logical cleanup plan was one that would take literally centuries; but when it became apparent that the Court was not receptive to this proposal, their estimates of plan time dropped like a thermometer before a winter storm. They ended up with a proposal only a third as long as their original one (from the 100 year chlorides-only Base plan to the 32 year plan), without a dramatic increase in present value cost. That they did not attempt to develop a plan ofreasonable length initially also goes to good faith, especially considering the slight difference in cost. When defendants did develop modifications to their plan, they did so at the last hour, after having told plaintiffs that they were not changing their proposal to the Court. This appeared to be an abortive attempt to preclude plaintiffs from being prepared to critique the new plan as they had critiqued the Base plan.
 

  In short, defendants conduct has
  
   not
  
  been one of attempting in good faith to develop the best possible proposal to clean up the aquifer: they have clearly tried to skate by with as little as possible, they
   
   *356
   
  have resisted and attempted to prevent plaintiffs’ input to the proposals, and they Ã¢ÂÂ  have utterly failed to demonstrate the attitude of contriteness in remedying the wrongs they created — an essential ingredient in any review of punitive damages. Instead, they have yet to admit to this Court that they did anything wrong at all. At times, when they point a finger to the Carey salt plume upstream or defend their inaction in the brine fields by claiming that, since the fields were not leaking, the defendants cannot be blamed for not fixing them, defendants actually seem to be denying that they had anything to do with the salt getting into the aquifer in the first place!
 

  Therefore, the Court concludes that defendants’ lack of good faith in developing their proposal and working with the plaintiffs during the remedial phase of this case precludes any possibility that they could be trusted to honestly pursue a cleanup attempt on the plaintiffs’ land in the years to come. Moreover, the Court finds that this lack of good faith also mitigates against any argument that the original award of punitive damages was unjustified. The evidence at trial portrayed a “corporate callousness” on the part of American Salt that seemed to warrant the imposition of the ten million punitive damage award. Defendants conduct during the post trial proceedings have shown that this initial impression was correct.
 

  A Court-ordered cleanup plan is therefore rejected because no feasible plan has been presented, and because defendants’ conduct during the remedial course of these hearings has militated against the possibility that such a plan could be satisfactorily implemented. Either of these reasons are sufficient to reject a plan, but the Court finds a third reason as well. Initially, plaintiffs favored a cleanup attempt. At trial they indicated that if they could have their choice of remedy, they would choose clean water over money.
  
   Miller,
  
  592 F.Supp. at 998. Although plaintiffs may still prefer this remedy in the abstract, they have begun to indicate to the Court their hesitancy about pursuing this remedy in the concrete. At the January, 1986, hearing, plaintiffs’ counsel summed up plaintiffs’ objection to the Base plan thusly: “This plan calls for my clients to be married to the defendants for two hundred years; but, your Honor, we aren’t getting along
  
   now.”
  
  Plaintiffs continual trouble with defendants has led to the change in plaintiffs’ support of remedial action. More than once they have told the Court that, if things continued as they were, they would prefer to just take the money and foget about working out a remedial plan with the defendants. The Court cannot blame plaintiffs for their frustration. The Court has not seen anything to persuade it that things will not continue as they have been. Defendants dismiss these problems. “Despite certain recent and disturbing statements by plaintiffs’ counsel, we trust and fully expect that plaintiffs were then, and are now, men and women of their word and that the position they ultimately take will unequivocally confirm their initial representation to the Court.” Dk. 661, p. 3. This Court finds that defendants’ betrayal of faith removes any question of the trustworthiness of plaintiffs’ word. And this Court would be reluctant to order implementation of any remedial plan without the support of the plaintiffs.
 

  Defendants cannot claim that the Court has duped them by requiring the expenditure of all of these investigation costs, and then imposing the full amount of punitive damages. Despite attempts by defendants to imply otherwise, the Court made no promises or guarantees of punitive damage reduction at the beginning of the remedial phase. Had the Court not ordered this phase, KDHE would have required similar action and equivalent expenditures from them anyway. More particularly, had defendants properly investigated the aquifer prior to trial so that the recharge rate and the SAR phenomenon were known then (see New Trial section,
  
   supra),
  
  it would have been clear at trial that a cleanup could not occur within the parameters desired by the plaintiffs and the Court. In that instance, the Court would never have embarked upon this phase. Defendants can blame no one but themselves that these
   
   *357
   
  factors were not known and that this stage was not avoided.
 

  Therefore, the Court finds that no feasible, Court-implementable plan has been presented and that defendants’ conduct throughout the remedial phase of this case does not warrant a reduction in the punitive damage award initially made. Accordingly, defendants are ordered to pay the ten million punitive damage award, together with interest from August 13, 1984; the initial date of judgment.
 

  VI. CONCLUSION
 

  Following a lengthy trial, this Court found for plaintiffs and awarded them 3.06 million dollars in actual damages. The Court further found that defendants’ conduct warranted a punitive damage award of ten million dollars. Because plaintiffs had indicated their preference for clean water over money, and because testimony had been presented that a cleanup might be technically feasible, the Court held the punitive damage award temporarily in abeyance, pending defendants’ good faith efforts to define and remedy the pollution they had caused. The Court indicated that, if defendants made a conscientious, good faith and realistic effort to remedy the pollution
  
   within a reasonable time,
  
  that effort would be extremely relevant to the Court’s assessment of the defendants’ state of mind and to the appropriateness of the punitive damage award.
 

  After an investigation and development period, defendants presented a cleanup plan lasting far longer than ever envisioned. Even at the end of the defendants’ continual reductions in plan time, the Court finds that the pollution is still not remediable
  
   within a reasonable time.
  
  Moreover, the Court finds that defendants’ conduct has been extremely relevant to the Court’s assessment of the defendants’ state of mind: it has demonstrated that the initial punitive damage award was appropriate.
 

  Most relevant of all is that, throughout this time, the defendants have continued to pollute. This is relevant to cleanup time, for continual pollution clearly extends the time necessary for cleanup. It is relevant to defendants’ state of mind, for while they have exerted incredible effort in attacking the Court’s judgment and arguing for the cleanup plan most favorable to them, they have failed to exert the necessary effort to stop their continual pollution. The Court therefore declines to remit any of the punitive damage award, because it is abundantly clear to the Court that we are no further along than we ever were: the “hog is still in the spring.”

George A. Arkwright, J.
The plaintiff, Empire Ralph. Corp., seeks, in this action, a permanent injunction against the defendant union, Moving Picture Machine Operators Union, Local 306, AFL-CIO, and its president, treasurer and business agent, prevening them from picketing the said theatre located at Ralph Avenue, in the Borough of Brooklyn, City and State of New York. The plaintiff is engaged in the business of operating the theatre for the exhibition of moving pictures, television and similar matters. The theatre had been closed for several years. About early March, 1956, the plaintiff corporation entered into a lease for the use of said theatre and in connection with its contemplated operation cleaned, repaired and refurbished the building. At that time there was no moving picture equipment in the building. The plaintiff purchased the same, delivery beginning on April 10, 1956 and running through April 14, 1956. While installing this equipment, the plaintiff employed on a temporary basis two so-called relief operators who were regularly licensed moving picture operators and who *602were members of the Independent Motion Picture Operators and Television Employees, Inc., Union, Subsequent to this and by agreement dated April 16,1956, the plaintiff entered into a contract with said Independent Union, by the terms of which it agreed to recognize the said union as the sole and exclusive bargaining agent of its employees as projectionists in the said theatre and agreed to employ projectionists for the period of the contract which is to terminate April 15, 1958, the said employees to be members in good standing of the said union. The plaintiff employer agreed to pay the said projectionists furnished by the union the sum of $165 a week for the period of the contract, the said salary based on a 77-hour work week and to be apportioned among the said projectionists, The plaintiff’s investment in the theatre, in actual expenditures and committals, amounted to some $18,000,
On April 27, 1956 the theatre was opened for business.
Shortly before that date, representatives of the defendant union made known to the officers of the plaintiff that they would insist upon motion picture projectionists of their union being employed as the projectionists of the theatre and, upon learning of the signing of the contract wdth the Independent Union by the plaintiff, commenced picketing the theatre.
It appears that the picketing consists of two pickets who walk to and fro in front of the theatre near the curb, carrying sandwich signs, and that four to five additional men as relief to these pickets stand or are at various times in the vicinity, usually across the street, but at such times do not engage in the picketing.. No more than two pickets are used at any one time. There is no disturbance, no interfering with the ingress or egress or passing to and fro of others, either by word or action, and the picketing at all times has been peaceful. Several signs have been used, but the one currently in use and for some 10 days past, reading in Spanish, requests that persons do not attend the theatre, stating that the owner of the theatre pays the employees less than the other theatres in New York City do and that the theatre does not have a retirement plan nor any of the other benefits that are given to the members of the defendant union, which is stated to be the only union that there is for motion picture operators who are members of the American Federation, Union Local 306.
The picketing has been in effect from April 27 and is still going on. The defense interposed is twofold. The first defense is that a majority of the projectionists in New York City earn their livelihood at a trade governed by collective bargaining agreements; that the defendant union, by diligent and skillful *603collective bargaining, has been able to achieve superior working conditions for its projectionists as to wages, hours, pension, welfare and other benefits; and that the Independent Union has not maintained such high standards of wage policies and benefits, has entered into an agreement with the plaintiff for wages and conditions below said standards and is thereby injuring the projectionists belonging to the defendant union by seeking to lower said standards of livelihood and benefits. The second defense is that the plaintiff has failed to comply with the terms and provisions of section 876-a of the Civil Practice Act relative to necessary statutory proof required by the court without which an injunction may not be granted.
Said section 876-a provides that the court shall not have jurisdiction to issue a temporary or a permanent injunction in any case involving or growing out of a labor dispute as therein defined, except after findings of all of the facts specified in the section to be filed in the record of the case.
A case is held to involve or grow out of a labor dispute, when used in section 876-a and for the purpose thereof, and from among the alternatives set forth therein, when it involves persons engaged in the same industry, trade, craft or occupation, when the case involves conflicting or competing interests in a “ labor dispute ” (as defined in the section) “ of ‘ persons participating or interested ’ therein ” (as defined in the section). (Civ. Prac. Act, § 876-a, subd. 10, par. [a].) As so defined, the term “ labor dispute ” includes any controversy concerning terms or conditions of employment or the representation of persons in negotiating, fixing, maintaining, claiming or seeking to arrange terms or conditions of employment, or concerning employment relations, or any other controversy arising out of the respective interests of ‘ ‘ employer and employee, regardless of whether or not the disputants stand in the relation of employer and employee.” (Civ. Prac. Act, § 876-a, subd. 10, par. [c].) The section further holds that a person or association participates or is interested in a labor dispute if relief is sought against him or it and if he or it is engaged in the industry, trade, craft or occupation in which such dispute occurs, or is a member, officer or agent of any association of employees engaged in such industry, trade, craft or occupation.
The evidence establishes a labor dispute within the above-mentioned section.
The plaintiff in its proof, has failed to comply with the requisite provisions of the section.
The evidence and the fair inferences therefrom also show that motion picture houses are classified in categories, according to *604the recognized practices of trade unions, based upon booths, seating capacity, first run of pictures and other considerations, including foreign language showings, and that union wages are based upon such considerations. The scale of wages in the contract, under plaintiff’s claim, is based upon 700 seats, which plaintiff claims are seats actually in use. There is moreover room for doubt in this as the actual seats in the balcony and orchestra amount to 1,098, and the theatre license of the City of New York specifies the theatre is licensed for 1,632 seats. The defendant union has shown that it is a well-organized union, conducting union operations in the five city boroughs, that it has numerous contracts with motion picture houses in the city, that the scale of wages of its employees in this line of business under similar or nearly similar conditions is higher than those paid by the plaintiff under its contract, that it has pension, hospitalization and other benefits reflected in its waige scales, and that it seeks and has a higher standard wage scale than does the Independent which has no pension or other union benefits for its members. The plaintiff offered no sufficient proof in contradiction of these assertions. The wording of the sign is within reasonable limits.
The injunction is denied. Judgment is granted in favor of the defendants dismissing the complaint. (Nash v. Mennan, 279 App. Div. 609; Brayer v. Charton, 37 N. Y. S. 2d 326; Stalban v. Friedman, 259 App. Div. 520; Buy-Wise Markets v. Winokur, 167 Misc. 235; Vim Electric Co. v. Solomon, 67 N. Y. S. 2d 908.)

  PER CURIAM.
 

  William Butler appeals the district court’s
  
   1
  
  imposition of Rule 11 sanctions and finding of contempt of court. Butler represents a group of Minnesota homeowners (collectively, “the homeowners”), who allege the Appellees, financial entities and mortgage servicers (collectively, “the lenders”), are not authorized to foreclose upon their homes. In the underlying case, we affirmed in part the district court’s decision, but reversed the dismissal of one claim and remanded the case for further proceedings.
  
   Murphy v. Aurora Loan Servs., LLC,
  
  699 F.3d 1027, 1034 (8th Cir. 2012),
  
   cert. denied,
  
  — U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2358, 185 L.Ed.2d 1068 (2013).
 

  After the district court dismissed the homeowners’ complaint for failure to state a claim, the homeowners appealed. While the case was still pending on appeal, the district court imposed Rule 11 sanctions against Butler in the amount of $50,000.
  
   2
  
  The district court found that Butler’s arguments were frivolous, did not have any factual basis, and made no effort in good faith to modify existing law. Butler did
   
   *513
   
  not pay the sanction, and the lenders requested that the district court find that Butler was in contempt of court. The district court granted the lenders’ motion for contempt, imposing a $5,000 fine payable to the court and a $2,500 sanction payable to the lenders for their additional attorneys’ fees.
 

  We issued our opinion in
  
   Murphy
  
  after the district court imposed Rule 11 sanctions and the fine for contempt of court. In
  
   Murphy,
  
  we partially reversed the district court, concluding it erred in its “wholesale dismissal” of the homeowners’ quiet-title claim based upon finding that the claim was grounded upon the “show me the note” theory which was explicitly rejected in
  
   Jackson v. Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc.,
  
  770 N.W.2d 487 (Minn.2009).
  
   Murphy,
  
  699 F.3d at 1033. We concluded, however, that two of the allegations which supported the homeowners’ quiet-title claim were not premised on the discredited “show me the note” theory.
  
   Id.
  
  We remanded the matter to the district court for it to “address the matter in the first instance,” but affirmed the dismissal of the homeowners’ additional claims.
  
   3
  

   Id.
  
  at 1034.
 

  Butler now appeals the imposition of Rule 11 sanctions and the contempt of court finding. We review each under an abuse of discretion standard.
  
   FTC v. Neiswonger,
  
  580 F.3d 769, 773 (8th Cir. 2009) (contempt of court);
  
   Clark v. United Parcel Serv., Inc.,
  
  460 F.3d 1004, 1008 (8th Cir.2006) (Rule 11 sanctions).
 

  Butler argues that the Rule 11 sanctions were not warranted because (1) he adequately investigated the underlying factual claims and (2) the ease was supported by existing law or is an attempt to modify existing law. We disagree. First, we concluded in
  
   Murphy
  
  that the majority of the homeowners’ complaint was premised on the “show me the note” theory. Butler conceded at a hearing on the lenders’ motion to dismiss, however, that the homeowners “had received the notes.”
  
   See
  
  Mot. to Dismiss Hr’g Tr. 10, Jan. 6, 2012. Second, Butler’s litigation strategy does not represent aggressive advocacy aimed at making good-faith arguments to modify existing law. When Butler filed his memorandum opposing the lenders’ motion to dismiss on December 16, 2011, his frivolous arguments had been explicitly rejected by our court as well as the Minnesota Supreme Court.
  
   See Stein v. Chase Home Fin., LLC,
  
  662 F.3d 976 (8th Cir.2011);
  
   Jackson,
  
  770 N.W.2d at 487. Butler did not mention
  
   Stein
  
  in the homeowners’ memorandum in opposition to the lenders’ motion to dismiss. And although Butler cited
  
   Jackson,
  
  he primarily argued that it did not apply because it was not a quiet-title case, and he also tirelessly refused to acknowledge that it undermined the “show me the note” theory.
 

  “[A] judge can sanction a litigant for filing a frivolous suit or claim regardless of the motives for such filing, and in deciding whether to sanction such a litigant he can take into account a history of frivolous litigation.”
  
   See Reed v. Great Lakes Cos.,
  
  330 F.3d 931, 936 (7th Cir.2003). As the district court noted in its order dismissing the homeowners’ claims, Butler had “doggedly refused to acknowledge” that the claims were “based on a legal fallacy,” and continued to bring “baseless cases” that “detract and distract from serious, legitimate claims.” Butler has a history of filing similar motions in other mortgage-foreclosure cases.
  
   See Butler v. Bank of
  
 
   *514
   

   Am.,
  
  N.A.,690 F.3d 959, 962 n. 3 (8th Cir.2012) (outlining Butler’s pattern of “mak[ing] false representations and spin[ning] out contradictory and often absurd arguments in the apparent hope that their sheer weight and number, multiplied by the number of parties and claims, will overwhelm his opponents and the court” (internal quotation marks omitted)).
 

  The district court did not abuse its discretion when it sanctioned Butler pursuant to Rule 11. However, because of our limited remand in
  
   Murphy,
  
  we are hesitant to affirm the full award of Rule 11 sanctions. Therefore, we affirm the district court’s sanction of Butler, but remand the matter to the district court for it to reconsider the amount of the award, recognizing it may ultimately conclude the original award is appropriate.
 

  Finally, Butler contends that the district court’s contempt order was punitive, entitling him to criminal procedure protections. A court may impose civil contempt sanctions “to compensate parties aggrieved by contumacious conduct or to coerce compliance with the court’s orders.”
  
   Chaganti & Assocs., P.C. v. Nowotny,
  
  470 F.3d 1215, 1224 (8th Cir.2006). In its written order finding Butler in contempt of court, the district court concluded the fine would “urge Butler into compliance” and that the fee award would reimburse the lenders. Based on a careful review of the record, we conclude Butler’s arguments regarding the contempt order are without merit.
 

  Accordingly, we remand this case to the district court for it to reconsider the amount of the sanction in light of
  
   Murphy,
  
  and we affirm the district court in all other respects.

2157497,2157497,2028136,In Re Marriage of Carletti,"In Re the Marriage of ROSALIE JEAN and WILLIAM MARIO CARLETTI. WILLIAM MARIO CARLETTI, Respondent, v. ROSALIE JEAN CARLETTI, Appellant","

 
   *991
   
  Opinion
 

  STEPHENS, J.
 

  This is an appeal from an order setting aside an interlocutory judgment of dissolution.
 

  Rosalie and William Carletti had been married for over 20 years when, in September 1972, William (respondent) filed for a dissolution. In order to equally divide their community property, both parties engaged in extensive discovery proceedings, which included depositions, and an examination of the books and records of respondent’s business, GM Dealers Supply Company, Inc. (GM), in which he was an officer, director, and managing partner.
  
   1
  
  Subsequent to discovery, the parties stipulated in open court to a division of the property, and such stipulation was incorporated into the trial court’s interlocutory judgment of dissolution entered on August 21, 1973.
 

  Pursuant to the order of dissolution and in accordance with the stipulation, appellant was awarded the family residence, together with all household furniture and fixtures. Respondent was ordered to pay all existing encumbrances; to maintain a policy of life insurance for $50,000, with appellant as beneficiary; to pay to appellant the sum of $10,000; and to pay appellant’s attorney’s fees. Further, respondent was directed to pay spousal support of $590 monthly until appellant’s death or remarriage, whichever occurs first. Respondent was awarded all stock and interest in GM and in CWC Supply, Inc., as well as certain real property, and the parties’ checking and savings accounts.
 

  In November 1973, an audit of GM revealed that the company had been overvalued by $264,000. This discrepancy between the actual assets of the company and the value as reflected by the company’s records existed at least since November 1972. In February 1974, both GM and CWC were forced to terminate their businesses. It does not appear nor does respondent contend that appellant had any knowledge of or involvement in the activities of the businesses. Faced with increasing debts and unable to maintain his support payments, respondent, on July 10, 1974, filed a motion to vacate the interlocutory judgment of dissolution and to modify the spousal support order. Following a hearing, the court granted respondent’s motion and ordered the prior
   
   *992
   
  interlocutory order vacated. After a denial of appellant’s motion to reconsider, appellant filed this appeal.
 

  Respondent seeks to sustain the trial court’s judgment on the ground that because of a mistake in the valuation of the community property, there was no equal division of such property in accordance with Civil Code section 4800. However, in order to successfully challenge the court’s interlocutory decree, respondent either had to appeal that court’s order or, since no appeal was taken, he had to show that he comes within the provisions of Code of Civil Procedure section 473, which sets forth the proper method for challenges to the court’s interlocutory decree. Under section 473, a court may “relieve a parly . . . from a judgment, order, or other proceeding taken against him through his mistake, inadvertence, ... or excusable neglect,” provided application for such relief is made within six months after the judgment or order is entered. Since respondent did not file his petition to set aside the judgment until July 10, 1974—over 10 months after the order was entered—it is clear that the court was without jurisdiction to set the judgment aside under section 473.
  
   (Leupe
  
  v.
  
   Leupe,
  
  21 Cal.2d 145, 148 [130 P.2d 697].) Although not disputing this, respondent urges that because of the mistake in determining the value of his business, the interlocutory judgment should be set aside on equitable grounds. However, it has been established in a number of cases that a “final judgment of a court having jurisdiction over persons and subject matter can be attacked in equity after the time for appeal or other direct attack has expired only if the alleged . . . mistake is extrinsic rather than intrinsic.”
  
   (Westphal
  
  v.
  
   Westphal,
  
  20 Cal.2d 393, 397 [126 P.2d 105]; see also
  
   Jorgensen
  
  v.
  
   Jorgensen,
  
  32 Cal.2d 13 [193 P.2d 728].) “Thus, equitable relief will be denied where it is sought to relitigate an issue involved in the former proceeding on the ground that allegations or proof of either party [were] fraudulent or based on mistake, but such relief may be granted if the party seeking it was precluded by fraud or the mistake of the
  
   other party
  
  from participating in the proceeding or from fully presenting his case.”
  
   (Id.,
  
  at p. 18; italics added.) In determining whether equitable relief of this kind should be granted, it is necessary to examine the facts of each case in “light of the policy that a party who failed to assemble all his evidence at the trial should not be privileged to relitigate a case, as well as the policy permitting a party to seek relief from a judgment entered in a proceeding in which he was deprived of a fair opportunity fully to present his case.”
  
   (Id.,
  
  at p. 19.) These principles are applicable to dissolution decrees which incorporate an agreement for alimony awards
   
   *993
   
  and property settlements.
  
   (Kulchar
  
  v.
  
   Kulchar,
  
  1 Cal.3d 467, 471 [82 Cal.Rptr. 489, 462 P.2d 17, 39 A.L.R.3d 1368].)
 

  Thus, a court will grant equitable relief from a judgment where the moving party has demonstrated that because of extrinsic fraud or mistake he was denied an opportunity to fully present his case, or was kept in ignorance thereof, resulting in no true adversary proceeding. It is clear from the record before us that respondent has failed to adequately demonstrate the existence of extrinsic mistake. Respondent was not denied a meaningful opportunity to a full and fair hearing. Indeed, the extensive discovery proceedings that preceded the interlocutory judgment would weigh against any such claim by respondent. Any mistake in the valuation of respondent’s businesses can only be attributed to his own negligence, and as such, relief will be “denied when the complaining party has contributed to the fraud or mistake giving rise to the judgment thus obtained.”

  v.
  
   Wilson,
  
  55 Cal.App.2d 421, 427 [130 P.2d 782].)
 

  However, respondent argues that the property settlement agreement entered into was a contract and thus required mutual consent of the parties in order to be valid.
  
   2
  
  Since Civil Code section 1567 states that consent “is not real or free when obtained through . . . mistake,” respondent maintains that no valid contract existed upon which the trial court could base its judgment. Respondent cites
  
   In re Marriage of Nicolaides,
  
  39 Cal.App.3d 192 [114 Cal.Rptr. 56], for the proposition that where there exists mutual mistake in the execution of a property settlement agreement, an interlocutory decree incorporating the agreement may be set aside without the necessity of establishing extrinsic fraud or mistake.
  
   Nicolaides
  
  recognized, however, that such judgment “may properly be set aside or modified after the time for appeal or other direct attack has expired upon a showing of extrinsic fraud or mistake —”
  
   (Id.,
  
  at p. 198.) In
  
   Nicolaides,
  
  the court did not discuss the issue of mutual mistake, nor does it appear that the issue was raised therein.  As the court in
  
   Kulchar, supra,
  
  pointed out: “[A] mutual mistake that might be sufficient to set aside a contract is not sufficient to set aside a final judgment. The principles of res judicata demand that the parties present their entire case in one proceeding. ‘Public policy requires that
   
   *994
   
  pressure be brought upon litigants to use great care in preparing cases for trial and in ascertaining all the facts. A rule which would permit the re-opening of cases previously decided because of error or ignorance during the progress of the trial would in a large measure vitiate the effects of the rules of res judicata.’ ”
  
   (Kulchar
  
  v.
  
   Kulchar, supra,
  
  1 Cal.3d 467 at p. 472, quoting Rest., Judgments, § 126, com. a.) Therefore, the trial court was in error in sustaining respondent’s motion to set aside the interlocutory judgment of dissolution.

  There remains to consider whether, on remand, the trial court may properly modify the spousal support order. In entering its interlocutory decree, the trial court incorporated the following portion of the stipulation: “It is further ordered that said $590 spousal support herein ordered to be paid shall not be subject to modification, either upward or downward, for any reason whatsoever, including, without limitation, any earnings of... Rosalie Jean Carletti, by means of gainful employment or otherwise, and . . . William Mario Carletti, Sr., has waived any claim or right thereto.” Respondent contends that the “property settlement agreement” is nonintegrated and severable, and thus the court can, under Civil Code section 4801,
  
   4
  
  modify the support order in light of the changed circumstances of the parties.
 

  Generally, where the parties intend that the support payments or alimony be made an integral part of the division of the property, the property settlement agreement will be considered integrated and
  
   (Dexter
  
  v.
  
   Dexter,
  
  42 Cal.2d 36, 41-42 [265 P.2d 873];
  
   Plumer
  
  v.
  
   Plumer,
  
  48 Cal.2d 820, 824 [313 P.2d 549];
  
   Bradley
  
  v.
  
   Superior Court,
  
  48 Cal.2d 509, 518 [310 P.2d 634].) Where it is determined that the
   
   *995
   
  agreÃÂ©ment is integrated, it cannot be modified except upon consent of both parties.
  
   (Plumer
  
  v. Plumer,
  
   supra,
  
  at p. 824;
  
   Puckett
  
  v.
  
   Puckett,
  
  21 Cal.2d 833, 840 [136 P.2d 1].) While it may be assumed that the agreement here was nonintegrated and thus subject to modification, it does not appear that Civil Code section 4801 is applicable. When this section is read together with Civil Code section 4811, subdivision (b), it becomes clear that section 4801 was intended to apply only to those situations where the parties have not entered into any agreement, either prior to or during the trial, leaving it to the discretion of the court to establish the amount, if any, of the support payments.
  
   (In re Marriage of Hawkins,
  
  48 Cal.App.3d 208 [121 Cal.Rptr. 681].) Conversely, section 4811, subdivision (b) seems directly applicable in that it provides that “The provisions of any agreement for the support of either party shall be deemed to be separate and severable from the provisions of the agreement relating to property. All orders for the support of either party based on such agreement shall be deemed to be law-imposed and shall be deemed made under the power of the court to make such orders. The provisions of any agreement or order for the support of either party shall be subject to subsequent modification or revocation by court order, except
  
   ... to the extent that
  
  any written agreement, or, if there is no written agreement,
  
   any oral agreement entered into in open court between the parties, specifically provides to the contrary.”
  
  (Italics added.)
 

  The stipulation of the parties, entered into in open court, clearly states that the support payments shall not be modified “for any reason whatsoever,” and, as hereinbefore set forth, the trial court incorporated that stipulation in its order. Where the parties have so agreed, section 4811, subdivision (b), precludes modification of the support order.
  
   (In re Marriage of Hawkins, supra,
  
  48 Cal.App.3d 208, at p. 213;
  
   Tilghman
  
  v.
  
   Superior Court,
  
  40 Cal.App.3d 599, 613 [115 Cal.Rptr. 195].)
 

  The judgment (order setting aside the interlocutory judgment and granting modification of support payments) is reversed. Costs to appellant.
 

  Kaus, P. J., and Hastings, J., concurred.

   Respondent also had an interest in a company named CWC Supply, Inc.
  


   2
  

   Although the court divided the community property and ordered spousal support payments on the basis of the parties’ stipulation, it is clear that such a stipulation had the same force and effect as would a written property settlement agreement executed by the parties prior to trial.
   
    (In re Marriage of Carter,
   
   19 Cal.App.3d 479, 488 [97 Cal.Rptr. 274].)
  


   3
  

   By deciding that no extrinsic mistake existed such as would allow the trial court to properly vacate its judgment, it is unnecessary to consider appellant’s contention that the mistake was a result of respondent’s neglect of his duty of management and control of the businesses.
  


   4
  

   CiviI Code section 4801 provides; “(a) In any judgment decreeing the dissolution of a marriage or a legal separation of the parties, the court may order a party to pay for the support of the other party any amount, and for such period of time, as the court may deem just and reasonable having regard for the circumstances of the respective parties, including the duration of the marriage, and the ability of the supported spouse to engage in gainful employment without interfering with the interests of the children of the parties in the custody of such spouse. The court may order the party required to make such payment of support to give reasonable security therefor. Any order for support of the other party may be modified or revoked as the court may deem necessary, except as to any amount that may have accrued prior to the date of the filing of the notice of motion or order to show cause to modify or revoke. The order of modification or revocation may be made retroactive to the date of filing of the notice of motion or order to show cause to modify or revoke, or to any date subsequent thereto.”

                                No. 20220204

Crothers, Justice.

[¶1] Miguel Andrews appeals from a divorce judgment dividing the marital
estate between Candice Crichlow and him. We conclude the district court
clearly erred by including in the marital estate the value of Andrews’s financial
accounts opened after the agreed upon valuation date. We affirm in part,
reverse in part, and remand.

                                       I

[¶2] Crichlow and Andrews married in 2013. Crichlow sued Andrews for
divorce in August 2020. At the October 2021 trial, the parties presented
evidence and testimony about their assets and debts, including Crichlow’s
medical school debt and Andrews’s financial accounts. During the parties’
relationship but before they married, Crichlow attended medical school in
Trinidad and Tobago and incurred a $334,726 debt.

[¶3] Crichlow served Andrews with discovery requesting the identification of
all financial assets. Crichlow requested the balances of Andrews’s accounts as
of the date the divorce proceeding was commenced. Crichlow testified
Andrews’s discovery responses were received on August 13, 2021.

[¶4] Andrews listed the balances of six accounts on or near August 28, 2020,
the date he received service of the summons: two checking accounts, a savings
account, a 401(k), a Robinhood account and an NDPERS pension. Andrews’s
financial assets totaled $42,324.61. In response to a request for assets “not
otherwise provided within your responses” Andrews provided three additional
accounts: a Wealthfront IRA, a Wealthfront brokerage account and a
Wealthfront individual cash account. The Wealthfront accounts totaled
$65,538.61. He stated the Wealthfront accounts included “funds from the date
of [the] complaint plus funds from the interim.” Andrews testified the
Wealthfront accounts did not exist when he was served with the summons and
complaint. He testified he opened the Wealthfront accounts in December 2020
“to roll my old 401(k) into an IRA so that I could continue contributing to it.”

                                       1
He testified he rolled funds from a checking account into the brokerage account
and the rest of the Wealthfront account funds were from money he “earned
between the complaint and [trial].” Andrews testified the value of the
Wealthfront accounts should not be included in the marital estate.

[¶5] The district court valued the marital estate as of August 28, 2020, when
Andrews was served with the summons. The court included in the marital
estate Crichlow’s medical school debt and the value of Andrews’s assets,
including the Wealthfront accounts. The court divided the marital equity
equally between the parties. The court awarded Crichlow the marital home
and the mortgage. The court held Crichlow responsible for repaying her
medical school debt. The court awarded Andrews his financial accounts and
held him responsible for his debts. Andrews also received a $21,695 property
equalization payment.

                                        II

[¶6] Andrews argues the district court erred in distributing the marital
estate.

[¶7] The district court’s distribution of property will not be reversed on appeal
unless its findings are clearly erroneous. Willprecht v. Willprecht, 2020 ND 77,
¶ 19, 941 N.W.2d 556. A finding is clearly erroneous if it is induced by an
erroneous view of the law, there is no evidence to support it, or if, on the entire
record, we are left with a definite and firm conviction a mistake has been made.
Id. at ¶ 10.

[¶8] Under N.D.C.C. § 14-05-24(1), the district court must make an equitable
property distribution. The court must include all of the parties’ assets and
debts in the marital estate and then consider the Ruff-Fischer guidelines to
determine an equitable property distribution. Willprecht, 2020 ND 77, ¶ 19.
The Ruff-Fischer guidelines include the following factors:

      “[T]he respective ages of the parties, their earning ability, the
      duration of the marriage and conduct of the parties during the
      marriage, their station in life, the circumstances and necessities of
      each, their health and physical condition, their financial

                                        2
      circumstances as shown by the property owned at the time, its
      value at the time, its income-producing capacity, if any, whether
      accumulated before or after the marriage, and such other matters
      as may be material.”

Willprecht, at ¶ 19 (quoting Lee v. Lee, 2019 ND 142, ¶ 12, 927 N.W.2d 104).

                                       A

[¶9] Andrews asserts the district court should not have included the values
of the Wealthfront accounts in the marital estate. He claims the Wealthfront
accounts opened after the August 28, 2020 valuation date are non-marital
assets.

[¶10] Under N.D.C.C. § 14-05-24(1), “the valuation date for marital property
and debt is the date mutually agreed upon between the parties.” The district
court “[does] not have discretion to include property acquired after [the
valuation date] in valuing the marital estate.” Berdahl v. Berdahl, 2022 ND
136, ¶ 18, 977 N.W.2d 294. Any assets acquired after the valuation date are
not subject to distribution by the court. Id. (citing Wald v. Wald, 2020 ND 174,
¶ 16, 947 N.W.2d 359).

[¶11] The district court found Andrews and Crichlow “agreed on a valuation
date as the date of service of the summons or the nearest date to that time for
which information is available.” Andrews was served the summons on
August 28, 2020.

[¶12] The district court included the values of Andrews’s Wealthfront accounts
in the marital estate. The court found:

            “Regarding the financial and retirement accounts, the
      parties agree on the values of all accounts. Miguel testified that
      his Wealthfront Brokerage Account, Wealthfront IRA Account, and
      Wealthfront Individual Cash Account were opened in December
      2020 and argues that since this was after the date of the parties’s
      separation in September 2020 these accounts should not be
      included in the marital estate. However, given the amounts
      indicated in these funds, the proximity in time to the parties’s
      separation when these accounts were opened, and Miguel’s

                                       3
      earnings from employment during that time period, it appears that
      the great majority of the funds in these accounts would have been
      earned during the marriage and prior to separation and, therefore,
      will be included in the marital estate for the purposes of making a
      fair and equitable distribution.”

[¶13] Andrews testified he opened the Wealthfront accounts in December
2020, after the valuation date. He testified he transferred funds from accounts
that existed on the valuation date into the Wealthfront accounts. Crichlow did
not present evidence to rebut Andrews’s testimony relating to the Wealthfront
accounts. Crichlow testified she did not know about the Wealthfront accounts,
but she did not claim Andrews hid the assets or opened the accounts before
December 2020.

[¶14] In Kitzan v. Kitzan, 2023 ND 23, ¶ 9, we addressed a similar argument
about financial accounts opened after the valuation date. Heather Kitzan
argued three bank accounts opened after the date of separation should not
have been included in the marital estate. Id. The district court found Kitzan
moved funds “from existing accounts to newly opened accounts in an effort . . .
to conceal assets and reduce the overall marital estate.” Id. The court found
Kitzan’s testimony that she closed one account and moved the money into a
new account not credible because she did not provide documentation. Id. The
court included the funds in the new account to Heather Kitzan’s share of the
marital estate “[b]ased on the findings that she had hidden money and her
testimony was not credible.” Id. We affirmed the court’s findings because the
court weighed the testimony and “made a finding by choosing one of two
permissible views of the evidence.” Id.

[¶15] Here, the district court did not find Andrews’s testimony about opening
the Wealthfront accounts in December 2020 not credible. Nor did it find
Andrews was concealing assets. The court included Andrews’s Wealthfront
accounts in the marital estate because “it appear[ed] that the great majority of
the funds in these accounts would have been earned during the marriage and
prior to separation.” The court had evidence of Andrews’s funds on the
valuation date and after the Wealthfront accounts were opened. The court
nevertheless speculated the funds were earned during the marriage; however,


                                       4
no evidence established Andrews opened the accounts before the valuation
date. Andrews’s discovery response that the Wealthfront accounts included
funds “from the date of the complaint” is consistent with rolling existing funds
into a new account. Andrews provided his financial account balances on or near
the date he was served with the summons. The court did not have discretion to
include Andrews’s property acquired after the valuation date in the marital
estate. Berdahl, 2022 ND 136, ¶ 18.

[¶16] The district court’s inclusion of Andrews’s Wealthfront accounts acquired
after the valuation date was induced by an erroneous view of the law. We
reverse the court’s distribution of marital property, and remand with
instructions to include only Andrews’s financial accounts that existed on the
valuation date and to equitably distribute the property after determining the
value of the marital estate.

                                        B

[¶17] Because we are reversing the district court’s distribution of marital
property, on remand the court must determine an equitable division of the
property. We therefore address issues raised on appeal that are likely to arise
on remand. Berdahl, 2022 ND 136, ¶ 19.

[¶18] Andrews argues the district court erred in including Crichlow’s medical
school debt in the marital estate. He also claims the court erred in awarding
Crichlow the marital home.

[¶19] The district court must consider all of the parties’ assets and debts to
ensure an equitable distribution of the marital property. Neidviecky v.
Neidviecky, 2003 ND 29, ¶ 10, 657 N.W.2d 255. Separate property must be
included in the marital estate, but the property’s origin may be considered
when equitably dividing the estate. Feist v. Feist, 2015 ND 98, ¶ 6, 862 N.W.2d
817. After all of the parties’ assets and debts are included in the marital estate,
the court may consider which party has incurred particular debts, and the
purposes for which those debts were incurred, in determining an equitable
allocation of the responsibility for repayment. Neidviecky, at ¶ 11.



                                        5
[¶20] Although Crichlow incurred the medical school debt before the marriage,
the district court properly included the debt in the marital estate. The court
held Crichlow responsible for the debt. The court did not clearly err by
including Crichlow’s medical school debt in the marital estate.

[¶21] As to the marital home, the district court found Crichlow continued to
live in the home after the separation and “[Andrews] has made no request for
the home.” The court awarded Crichlow the home and the associated mortgage.
The record supports the court’s findings, and we are not left with a definite and
firm conviction a mistake was made. However, because we are reversing the
distribution of marital property, on remand the court may reconsider its earlier
distribution of marital assets.

                                      III

[¶22] We have considered Andrews’s remaining arguments and conclude they
are either without merit or not necessary to our opinion. The judgment is
affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for further proceedings.

"
1153157,1153157,549843,City of Aurora v. Martin,"City of Aurora, Municipal Corporation v. Marion J. Martin","

  MR. JUSTICE GROVES
 

  delivered the opinion of the Court.
 

  The respondent Marion Martin was convicted in the Aurora Municipal Court of violating the City of Aurora’s assault and battery ordinance. On appeal to the district court the conviction was reversed on the grounds that: (1) assault and battery is a matter of state-wide concern; and (2) the municipal ordinance was pre-empted by enactment of the state assault and battery statute. We view the matter differently.
 

 
   *74
   
  Aurora is a home rule city under Colo. Const, art. XX. The city’s assault and battery ordinance reads as follows:
 

  “An assault and battery is an unlawful beating of another. It shall be unlawful to commit assault and battery upon the' person of another. Any person found guilty of assault and battery upon conviction, shall be fined an amount not to exceed three hundred dollars ($300.00), or by imprisonment not to exceed ninety (90) days.”
 

  The language of the ordinance is practically identical to the state assault and battery statute, C.R.S. 1963, 40-2-35.
  
   1
  
  The only significant difference between the ordinance and the statute is that the statute provides a possible penalty of one year’s imprisonment, or a fine not exceeding five hundred dollars, or both.
 

  The city does not contend that assault and battery is a matter of strictly local and municipal concern.
  
   See Vela v. People,
  
  174 Colo. 465, 484 P.2d 1204 (1971). It argues, rather, that there is sufficient local concern with the subject of assault and battery so that it becomes a matter of “mixed” state and local concern.
  
   Woolverton v. Denver,
  
  146 Colo. 247, 361 P.2d 982 (1961). It calls attention to the fact that the majority of assault and battery filings in the Aurora Municipal Court result from domestic disputes. The' municipal court would seem particularly appropriate for handling this type of case. We conclude that the offense of assault and battery may be viewed as a matter of “mixed” state and local concern.
 

  The question then becomes whether the municipal ordinance and the state statute can co-exist within the city. We are not concerned here with a municipal ordinance which has intruded into a state established felony category.
  
   See
  
 
   *75
   

   Quintana v. Edgewater Municipal Court,
  
  179 Colo. 90, 498 P.2d 931 (1972). Neither are we concerned with the question of whether the subject of assault and battery so requires state-wide uniformity of regulation that a local ordinance cannot stand, since the local ordinance is practically identical to the state statute.
  
   See Bennion v. Denver,
  
  180 Colo. 213, 504 P.2d 350 (1972).
 

  There is nothing basically invalid about legislation on the same subject by both a home rule city and the state, absent some conflict between the two regulations.
  
   Bennion v. Denver, supra,
  
  and
  
   Vela v. People, supra.
  


  Several tests for determining whether an ordinance and statute conflict were set forth in
  
   Ray v. City and County of Denver,
  
  109 Colo. 74, 121 P.2d 886 (1942). As applied here, the essence is whether the ordinance authorizes what the state forbids, or forbids what the state has expressly authorized. In the light of this test, it is apparent that there is no conflict between the substantive portions of the city ordinance and the state statute.
 

  The respondent contends that a conflict does exist because the assault and battery statute provides for a greater penalty than does the municipal ordinance, citing
  
   Davis v. Denver,
  
  140 Colo. 30, 342 P.2d 674 (1959). In
  
   Davis
  
  this court did hold an ordinance invalid on the independent ground that the penalty provisions of the statute and ordinance “conflicted.” However, in the later cases of
  
   Vela v. People, supra,
  
  and
  
   Woolverton v. Denver, supra,
  
  no conflict was found even though the various statutes and ordinances considered in those cases had different penalties.
  
   Cf. Bennion v. Denver, supra.
  
  If a statute provides for a substantially greater penalty than does a similar municipal ordinance, this fact may be considered in ruling whether the General Assembly intended, by enactment of the statute, to pre-empt that field of regulation. Except in felony categories, mere difference in penalty provisions in a statute and ordinance does not necessarily establish a conflict in the sense discussed here.
 

  The final question is whether the state, by
   
   *76
   
  enactment of the assault and battery statute, pre-empted this area of regulation. There is no express declaration of any legislative intent to pre-empt. Additionally, there is nothing in the statue from which we can conclude that the state impliedly intended to preclude any exercise of municipal jurisdiction over the subject of assault and battery. In
  
   Retallick v. Colorado Springs,
  
  142 Colo. 214, 351 P.2d 884 (1960), this court rejected the idea that the mere enactment of a state statute constituted a pre-emption by the state of the matter regulated:
 

  “To accept the contention of the petitioner would be to adopt a doctrine of virtual pre-emption by the state in all matters upon which the legislature has taken cognizance through enactment of a state statute. It would also strip all of the home rule cities of the state of every last vestige of local rule and local control with the possible exception of a few regulatory and licensing ordinances.”
 

  We cannot say that the difference in penalty provisions between the statute and the ordinance is so great that the state’s interest will not be protected by a proceeding under the municipal ordinance.
 

  The respondent states that no case in Colorado has upheld the theory of concurrent state and municipal jurisdiction where the municipality was not specifically authorized by statute to legislate in the area in question. However, two cases decided since briefs were filed here, suggest that — but for certain other problems — concurrent jurisdiction was possible even though there was no specific statutory authorization for the ordinances in question.
  
   Bennion v. Denver, supra,
  
  and
  
   Quintana v. Edgewater Municipal Court, supra.
  


  While it might be possible to imply statutory authorization for municipal assault and battery ordinances from 1967 Perm. Supp., C.R.S. 1963, 139-33-1 (general police power), and C.R.S. 1963, 139-32-1(53) and (55) (fights and affrays), we do not feel compelled to do so. A statute specifically delegating the power of regulation to cities or towns would be useful in deciding that the state did
   
   *77
   
  not intend to pre-empt that field of regulation.
  
   Woolverton v. Denver, supra;
  
  and Klemme,
  
   The Powers of Home Rule Cities in Colorado,
  
  36 U. Colo. L. Rev. 321 (1964). The absence of such a statute is not determinative of the issue. As discussed earlier in this opinion, the authority for the city’s assault and battery ordinance emanates from Colo. Const, art. XX, § 6.
 

  The remaining contentions of the respondent are without merit.
 

  The judgment of the district court is reversed and the cause remanded with the direction that the judgment of the municipal court be reinstated.

   We should point out that this case arose prior to the effective date of the Colorado Criminal Code and the amendments to the state assault and battery statutes contained therein at 1971 Perm. Supp., C.R.S. 1963, 40-3-201 through 40-3-204. For this reason it was not argued and we do not consider here whether, in the light of those amendments, the city’s ordinance is valid.

Opinion by
Judge Rogees,
A referee, the Workmen’s Compensation Board1 and the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County all held that the claimant in this case, John Milovec, was entitled to compensation for total disability. The employer has appealed the order of the Court. We must reverse.
That the claimant was injured in his employment is not disputed nor is there any question that he suffered permanent injuries to his right arm which renders him unable to perform all of the duties of his last work as a real estate maintenance man or of his former employment as a coal miner. Nor is it seriously contended that the claimant, whom one medical witness described as being 35 per cent disabled and whose principle limitation is the inability to lift objects weighing more than 20 pounds, is unable to do some work.
*450The sole issue is whether the employer sustained its burden to prove that work other than that in which the claimant was engaged when injured was available to him, a duty imposed on it by Barrett v. Otis Elevator Co., 431 Pa. 446, 246 A. 2d 668 (1968). We do not have the benefit of the lower court’s thinking because its action is evidenced only by a judge’s brief holographic order stating only that the compensation authorities had not capriciously disregarded competent evidence supporting the employer’s cause. Our review compels us to the opposite conclusion.
The employer relied for proof of claimant’s employ-ability upon the testimony of Dr. Glen TJ. Cleeton, as industrial psychologist by intensive training and of wide experience, formerly Dean of Industrial Management, Humanities and Social Science of Carnegie-Mellon Institute of Technology and at the time of testifying a consultant for business enterprises in personnel relations, labor relations, job analysis and employment standards. After establishing his familiarity with the claimant’s physical condition, education and employment background, Dr. Cleeton stated that there were a number of positions within the claimant’s capabilities available in the vicinity of his residence, some of which were types of work the claimant had performed in the past. A portion of his testimony is: “These jobs [work the claimant could do] are available in the area, yes. The area figures for employment, about three per cent unemployment, which means that 97 out of every hundred people who want to work have a job or are on a payroll somewhere. The small eating and drinking establishments are crying for help. The larger ones are not. The hospitals are again — I’ll put the quotations around it, ‘crying for help.’ ”
This evidence was not rebutted by the claimant. His witness on this subject was a part-time teacher of psychology who believed, because the only physical work *451the claimant then did was cutting his own lawn, that the claimant was qualified only to be a groundskeeper for a cemetery or golf course. He did not know whether or not any such positions were in fact available in the area.
The Board, after ungenerously referring to Dr. Cleeton as a person who “described himself as a consultant regarding personnel relations, labor relations, job analysis and employment standards” correctly observed that Dr. Cleeton testified “that there were many jobs that claimant was capable of performing that are available to him in the area in which he resides.” It nevertheless concluded that the employer had not sustained its burden of proving the availability of work upon the following reasoning: “There is no evidence that claimant was offered any job that he was capable of performing and the testimony by Mr. Cleeton, at most, only shows that work might, or according to statistics should be available in the labor market in which he resides.” (Emphasis supplied.) This statement is not only inconsistent with the record and the Commission’s own recital of Dr. Cleeton’s testimony, its emphasis on the failure of the employer to prove a job offer, if not an error of law, indicates a view of the law not justified by the cases. As Judge Wilkinson well said in Matrunics v. Ruffsdale Coal Company, Inc., 6 Pa. Commonwealth Ct. 420, 422, 295 A. 2d 629 (1972) : “Justice Musmanno in Petrone and Justice Eagen in Barrett made it quite clear that what is required is testimony that positions for which claimant is qualified were available, not that one for which he was qualified had been offered to bim and rejected. This would be requiring conclusive proof and this was expressly rejected by Justice Eagen in Barrett. We make it clear that appellants’ testimony that nine positions for which claimant was qualified were available was not conclusive on him. He could testify, if such were the case, either that he had applied *452and was rejected or that he was not qualified. If such had been done, then the Referee’s and the Board’s decision could not be regarded as a capricious disregard of competent testimony. Without it, or any other testimony to explain why these specific positions were not available to claimant, as testified to by appellants’ witness, the Referee’s and the Board’s positions cannot be sustained.”
The Board in this case capriciously disregarded evidence of the availability of work suitable to the claimant’s condition and we must therefore make the following
Order
And now, this 10th day of January, 1974, the order of the court below is reversed; the record is remanded to the Workmen’s Compensation Appeal Board for appropriate findings on the extent of partial disability and an order for the payment by the defendants of compensation for partial disability from December 9, 1966, and for the payment of doctor, medical, hospital and other costs, stated with particularity.
Judge Crumlish dissents.

 Now the Workmen’s Compensation Appeal Board.

   MEMORANDUM OF DECISION AND ORDER
  


  SPATT, District Judge.
 

  This case arose out of a dispute between Arista Technologies, Inc. (the “plaintiff’ or “Arista”) and Arthur D. Little Enterprises (a “defendant” or “ADLE”) regarding the licensing agreement of patented technology owned by ADLE. The technology in question, known as “video spot remover” (“VSR”) technology, permits video cassette recorders (“VCRs”) to skip past commercials in videotaped television programs when the videotapes are played back.
 

  I.
  
   BACKGROUND
  


  A. Factual Background
 

  The following facts are taken from the Amended Complaint. In March 1993, defendant Jerry Iggulden (“Iggulden”), the owner and sole shareholder of defendant Invention Management Associates (“IMA”), and purported inventor of the VSR technology, assigned his rights to the technology to defendant ADLE, with the understanding that ADLE would develop it into something that could be integrated into a consumer product. On March 19, 1993, ADLE licensed the VSR System to
   
   *644
   
  plaintiff Arista, reserving for itself the right to license the technology to VCR manufacturers for incorporation directly into VCRs. At the time of license, ADLE told Arista that the VSR System worked.
 

  Arista hired third-party defendant Michael Harvey (“Harvey”), who was doing business as third-party defendant Cham-bord Technologies, Inc. (“Chambord”), to be its project manager and to supervise the integration of the VSR System into the consumer product called “Commercial Brake,” which is a device, separate and apart from a VCR, that attaches to a television and performs the commercial-skipping functions of the VSR System. Harvey, a former ADLE engineer, retained a team of engineers from Arthur D. Little (“ADL”), ADLE’s parent corporation, to assist him in developing the VSR System technology. In May 1993, after a meeting with the ADL engineers, Harvey concluded that the VSR System technology described in ADLE’s ’091 patent, did not work as promised; was inadequate to create a viable consumer product; and would require extensive engineering to develop it to a point where it would be suitable for integration into a consumer product.
 

  Later that month, Harvey fired the ADL team and hired Kyle Fields (“Fields”) and his company defendant Design Labs, Inc. (“Design Labs”) to develop the VSR System for Commercial Brake. After an initial review of the technology, Fields concluded that it was virtually useless, and, therefore, Design Labs began working from scratch.
 

  Meanwhile, Iggulden agreed to help Ar-ista make Commercial Brake in exchange for a fee of $10,000 per month for ten months; reimbursement of travel, entertainment, and other expenses, and 40% of the net profits on products sold by the venture. Iggulden was to provide Arista with consulting and management services for the development and marketing of the venture’s product.
 

  As a result of the relationship between Iggulden and Arista, Iggulden gained confidential information regarding Arista’s marketing research, including the results of consumer focus group studies. According to Arista, Iggulden gave this information to ADLE, which, in turn, used it to undermine Arista’s marketing of Commercial Brake and to benefit ADLE’s own competing efforts to license the VSR System to VCR manufacturers.
 

  Arista asserts that after Harvey hired Fields and Design Labs to develop the VSR System, Iggulden “mounted a tireless and successful effort to obtain Arista’s confidential technology for ADLE without any compensation for Arista as required by the license” (Amended Complaint, ¶ 47). Ig-gulden was included in an August 18, 1993, meeting to discuss Arista’s marketing plans. Iggulden claimed that the purpose of the meeting was so that everyone could “read from the same script,” but according to the plaintiff, Iggulden actually used this meeting to send Arista’s marketing plans to ADLE.
 

  Also in 1993, Iggulden threatened Arista that if it did not sign an Invention Rights and Disclosure Agreement, which would have permitted Design Labs to give the technology it had developed for Arista directly to ADLE, then ADLE would “conduct a very public launch” of its own version of the VSR System at the same time and place as the planned launch of Commercial Brake. Arista approached ADLE and asked for assurances that it would not conduct a simultaneous launch of a competing product, and ADLE promised that it would not do so. Based on ADLE’s assurances, Arista chose to continue giving Iggulden confidential marketing and technical information. Ultimately, at the January 1994 Consumer Electronics Show (“CES”), Arista launched Commercial Brake, and ADLE, together with Iggul-den, introduced its version of the VSR technology. Iggulden, who was being paid by Arista to promote their product, used Arista’s booth and resources at the CES to promote ADLE’s product and to conduct
   
   *645
   
  meetings with VCR manufacturers on licensing of the VSR technology.
 

  On January 24, 1994, Fields entered into another contract with Harvey, obligating Design Labs to continue its work for Aris-ta in exchange for a fee of $20,000 per month. Meanwhile, Iggulden began trying to persuade Fields and Design Labs to work for ADLE. Iggulden’s patent attorney sent Fields copies of Arista’s license with ADLE and Arista’s confidential contract with Harvey and promised to indemnify Design Labs and Fields against any legal claims by Arista and Harvey.
 

  Throughout February and March 1994, Fields and ADLE exchanged drafts of contracts, and on March 14, 1994, Fields signed a contract whereby Fields and Design Labs would help ADLE develop the VSR System so that it could be integrated into VCRs. Pursuant to the contract, ADLE would pay Fields the sum of $10,000 per month, and Fields would be able to work directly with the VCR manufacturers. On March ÃÂ5, 1994, Fields signed an agreement with ADLE, promising to keep secret the existence of their March 14 contract.
 

  From March through August 1994, Design Labs was working for Arista and ADLE, though Arista was unaware that Design Labs was also working for ADLE. During this five-month period, Design Labs disclosed to ADLE all of the intellectual property Design Labs had acquired from Arista as a result of working for Arista. In addition, Design Labs assigned to ADLE all of their rights in patent applications that had been filed based on Aris-ta’s intellectual property. On August 19, 1994, ADLE increased the compensation to Design Labs to the sum of $25,000 per month. On August 20, 1994, Fields provided Arista with written notice that Design Labs was terminating its work for Arista on the ground that it owed the company a few thousand dollars.
 

  B. Procedural History
 

  On January 10, 1996, this Court granted ADLE’s motion to compel arbitration and stayed the court proceedings pending the arbitration decision. In addition, the Court denied Arista’s motion to amend the complaint, with leave to renew following the arbitrator’s decision regarding .the ar-bitrability of the respective claims.
 

  On May 16, 1996, the arbitrator held that all of the claims were arbitrable with the exception of those claims involving the validity of various patents. In August 1996, Arista renewed its motion to amend the complaint. In a letter, dated February 5, 1997, the Court directed that the motion be withdrawn, without prejudice and with leave to renew after a decision by the arbitrator.
 

  On July 29, 1997, the arbitrator held that although Arista materially breached the license by failing to pay royalties, neglecting to put ADLE’s patent number on the technology, and failing to disclose certain technological advances, ADLE must pay Arista approximately $700,000 for the technology it appropriated from Arista without repaying their costs. The arbitrator did not find that ADLE had committed fraud, breached the license, misappropriated Arista’s technology, tortiously interfered with the contract, or violated Massachusetts law. After the Award of Arbitration was issued, Arista and ADLE requested reconsideration and modification on various different grounds. In response, the arbitrator issued a Supplemental Order on August 15, 1997, and a Modified Award on December 17, 1997 (all three awards collectively will be referred to as the “Arbitration Award”).
 

  On November 13, 1998, the Court granted ADLE’s motion to confirm the Arbitration Award and directed the Clerk of the Court to close the case.
  
   See Arista v. Arthur D. Little Enterprises, Inc.,
  
  27 F.Supp.2d 162 (E.D.N.Y.1998). On November 12, 1999, the Court granted Aris-ta’s motion to amend the complaint and directed the Clerk of the Court to re-open
   
   *646
   
  the case, but denied Arista’s motion for a permanent injunction.
 

  Arista alleges five counts in its Amended Complaint. In the first count, Arista claims that Iggulden breached his contract with Arista by failing to render any services of value to the plaintiff and breached its implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing by intentionally and maliciously harming Arista. As a second count, Arista alleges fraud and fraudulent non-disclosure by Iggulden on the grounds that (1) Iggulden falsely described the quality, nature, and extent of the services he was providing Arista, and Arista continued to pay Iggulden based on those false representations; (2) Iggulden facilitated the secret diversion of Arista’s intellectual property from Design Labs to ADLE; and (3) Iggulden knew that ADLE planned to launch a competitive product on the same date that Arista launched “Commercial Brake” but failed to disclose this fact in violation of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in the IMA contract. In the third count, Arista claims fraudulent non-disclosure by Design Labs, which Arista alleges failed to inform it that Design Labs was performing competing work for ADLE. In its fourth cause of action, Arista claims that Design Labs breached its contract with Arista, because Design Labs agreed to assign all of its inventions to Harvey and Arista and to keep Arista’s intellectual property and trade secrets confidential, but Design Labs failed to do so. As a fifth cause of action, Arista seeks a judgment declaring the ’091 Patent belonging to ADLE to be void and invalid.
 

  Presently before the Court are (1) a motion to dismiss Count II of the Amended Complaint by defendants Iggulden and IMA on the ground that it fails to plead fraud with the particularity required by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b); (2) a motion to dismiss the Amended Complaint by defendant Design Labs; (3) a cross-motion to for leave to file a Second Amended Complaint by plaintiff Arista; and (4) a motion to dismiss the Second Amended Complaint by defendant ADLE.
 

  II.
  
   DISCUSSION
  


  A. Motion to Dismiss Count II of the Amended Complaint by Defendants Iggulden and IMA for Failure to Plead Fraud With Particularity
 

  Arista raises two claims in Count Two of the Amended Complaint: a fraudulent misrepresentation claim
  
   (see
  
  Amended Complaint ¶ 75), and a fraudulent nondisclosure claim (see Amended Complaint ¶ 76). In their original motion papers, Ig-gulden and IMA moved to dismiss both claims. However, at oral argument held on December 22, 2000, Iggulden and IMA withdrew their motion to dismiss the fraudulent nondisclosure claim. Accordingly, the Court addresses only the motion to dismiss the fraudulent misrepresentation claim.
 

  When pleading a claim for fraud or misrepresentation, the plaintiff must aver the alleged fraudulent acts with particularity as required by Rule 9(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
  
   See Luce v. Edelstein,
  
  802 F.2d 49, 54 (2d Cir.1986);
  
   Asdourian v. Konstantin,
  
  77 F.Supp.2d 349, 353 (E.D.N.Y.1999). To satisfy the particularity requirement of Rule 9(b), the “the complaint must allege the time, place, speaker, and sometimes even the content of the alleged misrepresentation.”
  
   Ouaknine v. MacFarlane,
  
  897 F.2d 75, 79 (2d Cir.1990);
  
   Di Vittorio v. Equidyne Extractive Indus., Inc.,
  
  822 F.2d 1242, 1247 (2d Cir.1987);
  
   Luce,
  
  802 F.2d at 54.
 

  Although “knowledge” and “condition of mind” may be stated in general terms
  
   (see
  
  Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b)), “the relaxation of Rule 9(b)’s specificity requirement for scienter ‘must not be mistaken for license to base claims of fraud on speculation and eonclusory allegations.’ ”
  
   Shields v. Citytrust Bancorp, Inc.,
  
  25 F.3d 1124, 1128 (2d Cir.1994) (quoting
  
   O’Brien v. National Property Analysts Partners,
  
  936
   
   *647
   
  F.2d 674, 676 (2d Cir.1991));
  
   Ouaknine,
  
  897 F.2d at 79-80. Thus, allegations of scienter are sufficient when they are “supported by facts giving rise to a ‘strong inference’ of fraudulent intent.”
  
   Ouaknine,
  
  897 F.2d at 80;
  
   see Shields,
  
  25 F.3d at 1128;
  
   O’Brien,
  
  936 F.2d at 676. The “strong inference of fraud,” in turn, may be established either “(a) by alleging facts to show that defendants had both motive and opportunity to commit fraud, or (b) by alleging facts that constitute strong circumstantial evidence of conscious misbehavior or recklessness.”
  
   Shields,
  
  25 F.3d at 1128 (citing
  
   In re Time Warner Inc. Securities Litig.,
  
  9 F.3d 259, 268-69 (2d Cir.1993));
  
   Beck v. Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.,
  
  820 F.2d 46, 50 (2d Cir.1987).
 

  After examining the Amended Complaint and hearing oral argument, the Court finds that Arista has adequately pled fraud with respect to only one statement allegedly made by Iggulden. The Amended Complaint states the following in regard to Arista’s fraudulent misrepresentation claim:
 

  75. Iggulden made false representations about the quality, nature, and extent of the services he was providing Arista under the IMA Contract. In reliance on those false representations, Ar-ista continued to make payments to Ig-gulden and was damaged thereby.
 

  (Amended Complaint, ¶ 75). Although paragraph 75 refers to multiple “false representations,” the Amended Complaint describes only one specific alleged misrepresentation by Iggulden. Arista alleges that on August 18, 1993, Iggulden met with Arista to discuss Arista’s marketing plans for the January 1994 CES. According to Arista, at that meeting, Iggulden told Aris-ta that the purpose of the meeting was “ ‘so that we are all reading from the same script’ ” (Amended Complaint ¶ 54). Clearly, this portion of the Amended Complaint, read together with paragraph 75, alleges the date, speaker, place, and content of the alleged misrepresentation.
  
   Ouaknine,
  
  897 F.2d at 79;
  
   Di Vittorio,
  
  822 F.2d at 1247;
  
   Luce,
  
  802 F.2d at 54. Accordingly, Arista’s allegation of fraud, with respect to this statement only, satisfies the particularity requirement of Rule 9(b).
 

  However, the Court finds that all other assertions of fraud in the Amended Complaint lack the particularity required by Rule 9(b). Arista claims that Iggulden (1) “made false representations about the quality, nature, and extent of the services he was providing Arista under the IMA contract”
  
   (see
  
  Amended Complaint ¶ 75); (2) made “other assurances” (see Amended Complaint ¶ 53); and (3) “mounted a tireless and successful effort to obtain Arista’s confidential technology” (see Amended Complaint ¶ 74). However, without more information, a defendant reading these assertions would be aware only of vague allegations of unstated misrepresentations, assurances, and efforts. The defendant would be forced to defend himself and his reputation without the benefit of knowing when the false representations are alleged to have been made, to whom they were made, where they were made, or anything specific about their content. Moreover, the Amended Complaint does not put forth a single detail about the types of services or specific confidential technology to which the alleged misrepresentations related.
 

  In addition, Arista’s allegations regarding how they relied on the alleged misrepresentations to their detriment are completely vague. The wording of the fraudulent misrepresentation claim indicates that Arista claims its damages were incurred as a result of paying Iggulden when he was not owed money. However, looking at Arista’s factual allegations, it appears that it could be claiming that its damages were the result of giving Iggul-den market and technological research in reliance on his misrepresentations about the work he was doing for them. Rule 9(b) is intended “to provide a defendant with fair notice of a plaintiffs claim, to safeguard a defendant’s reputation from improvident charges of wrongdoing, and
   
   *648
   
  to protect a defendant against the institution of a strike suit.”
  
   O’Brien,
  
  936 F.2d at 676. Other than Iggulden’s August 18, 1993, statement, the Amended Complaint does not specify any other misrepresentation and fails to describe how Arista relied on alleged misrepresentations to their detriment. Thus, with the exception of Iggulden’s August 18, 1993, statement to Arista that the purpose of their meeting was to ensure that they were all on the same page, Arista’s claim of fraud does not fulfill either the letter or the purpose of Rule 9(b).
 

  Accordingly, the Court grants in part and denies in part the motion to dismiss Count II of the Amended Complaint. Ar-ista’s fraudulent misrepresentation claim is dismissed except to the extent that it relies upon the August 18, 1993, statement by Iggulden to Arista. Any future litigation of the fraudulent misrepresentation claim is limited to that statement.
 

  In passing, the Court notes the well settled principle of New York State law that in order to allege a claim of fraud arising out of a contractual relationship, a plaintiff must not only allege the basic elements of fraud, but also either “(1) a legal duty separate and apart from the contractual duty to perform; (2) a fraudulent representation collateral or extraneous to the contract; or (3) special damages proximately caused by the fraudulent representation that are not recoverable under the contract measure of damages.”
  
   Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc. v. Recovery Credit Servs. Inc.,
  
  98 F.3d 13, 20 (2d Cir.1996);
  
   DS Capital, Inc. v. Carlisle Sports Emporium, Inc.,
  
  116 F.Supp.2d 376, 378 (E.D.N.Y.2000);
  
   Pacs Indus. v. Cutler-Hammer, Inc.,
  
  103 F.Supp.2d 570, 571-72 (E.D.N.Y.2000). Given these requirements, the Court is uncertain about how the plaintiff intends to establish fraud arising out of the contractual relationship between Arista and Iggulden.
 

  B. Motion to Dismiss Counts III and IY of the Amended Complaint By Defendant Design Labs
 

  Arista alleges two causes of action against Design Labs in the Amended Complaint: breach of contract and fraudulent non-disclosure. In support of its breach of contract claim, Arista asserts that Design Labs (1) gave ADLE Arista’s intellectual property and trade secrets; (2) worked for ADLE while doing similar work for Arista; and (3) failed to provide Arista with all of the technological advances Design Labs developed while under contract with Aris-ta. In regard to the fraudulent non-disclosure claim, Arista asserts that Design Labs owed Arista duties of good faith and fair dealing, because those duties were implied in the contracts between Design Labs and Arista. According to Arista, Design Labs breached this duty by failing to disclose (1) the work it was performing for ADLE, and (2) the alleged fact that it had divulged Arista’s confidential intellectual property to ADLE. Design Labs moves to dismiss the two counts against them on the grounds that (1) this Court lacks personal jurisdiction over Design Labs; (2) the contractual arbitration and forum selection clauses bar Arista’s Litigation against Design Labs; and (3) Arista’s claims against Design Labs are barred by the applicable statute of limitation.
 

  1. Personal Jurisdiction
 

  In deciding defendant Design Labs’ motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(2), the Court will consider the facts as set forth in the Amended Complaint and the various affidavits submitted by the parties on that issue.
  
   See Ball v. Metallurgie Hoboken-Overpelt, S.A.,
  
  902 F.2d 194, 196-98 (2d Cir.1990).
 

  In a 12(b)(2) motion, the plaintiff bears the burden of demonstrating that the court has jurisdiction over the defendant.
  
   See Bank Brussels Lambert v. Fiddler Gonzalez & Rodriguez,

  Personal jurisdiction over a non-resident defendant in a federal diversity action is determined by the law of the forum state.
  
   See A.I. Trade Finance, Inc.,
  
  989 F.2d at 79-80;
  
   Jazini,
  
  148 F.3d at 183-84. As a result, the Court must look to New York’s personal jurisdiction statutes, CPLR §§ 301 and 302, to determine whether Ar-ista has made a prima facie showing of personal jurisdiction over Design Labs. If the exercise of jurisdiction is appropriate under the statute, the court then must decide whether such exercise comports with the requisites of due process.
  
   See Bensusan Restaurant Corp. v. King,
  
  126 F.3d 25, 27 (2d Cir.1997).
 

  Although Arista does not specify a jurisdictional theory in the Amended Complaint, in their current motion papers Aris-ta claims that Design Labs is subject to the personal jurisdiction of this Court pursuant to CPLR sections 302(a)(1) and 302(a)(3)(ii). Arista also contends that personal jurisdiction over Design Labs comports with due process because Design Labs knew or should reasonably have expected that its alleged breaches of contract and alleged tortious conduct would have consequences within the State of New York. The Court will examine each of these theories of jurisdiction in turn.
 

  a) Personal Jurisdiction Under Section 302(a)(1)
 

  CPLR section 302(a)(1) confers jurisdiction over a foreign corporation that “transacts business within the state or contracts anywhere to provide goods and services in the state” if there is a “direct relationship between the cause of action and the in state conduct.”

The exercise of jurisdiction under this provision will comport with the due process guarantees only if “ ‘the defendant purposefully avails itself of the privilege of conducting activities within [New York], thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws.’”

  To determine whether a party in a contract action has “transacted business” within the meaning of § 302(a)(1), courts consider, among other things, the following factors: (1) whether the contract was negotiated and executed in New York, and whether the defendant visited New York
   
   *650
   
  for the purpose of meeting with the parties after the contract had been executed; (2) whether the contract contains a New York choice-of-law clause; (3) whether the contract is to be performed in New York; (4) whether the contract requires notices and payments to be sent to New York; and (5) defendant’s physical presence in New York in connection with an ongoing contractual relationship with a New York corporation.

   Snyder v. Madera Broadcasting, Inc.,
  
  872 F.Supp. 1191, 1194 (E.D.N.Y.1995).
 

  Here, Arista contends that Design Labs transacted business in New York, because Design Labs entered into contracts with a New York corporation, namely Arista, to supply technology services in New York State. Arista further asserts that Design Labs knew that it was contracting with a New York corporation when it was negotiating and executing contracts with Harvey, because Design Labs understood Harvey to be Arista’s agent. Arista also insists that personal jurisdiction exists because Design Labs knew that the technology services it was to provide pursuant to the contract with Harvey were for the benefit of Arista, a New York corporation. This theory of jurisdiction, which is articulated for the first time in Arista’s opposition papers, is generalized and glosses over the specific analysis of factors required by
  
   Agency Rent A Car
  
  and due process.
 

  On the other hand, in uncontradicted papers submitted to this Court, Design Labs explains that the “contracts” to which Arista refers are actually a series of seven, separate, short-term contracts and a confidentiality agreement
  
   (see
  
  Affidavit of Kyle Fields, President of Design Labs, [hereinafter Fields Aff.] ¶¶ 6-11). Only two of the contracts included Arista as a party (the “Arista Agreements”), and those contracts were for the non-technical industrial design of a plastic case for the stand-alone device and for the design of an integrated circuit component called a “custom gate array”
  
   (see
  
  Fields Aff. ¶¶ 6-11). Design Labs completed performance on these contracts prior to January 1994
  
   (see
  
  Fields Aff. ¶ 9).
 

  Design Labs also describes the remaining five contracts in the series. All of these contracts were between Design Labs and Chambord (the “Chambord Agreements”)
  
   (see
  
  Fields Aff. ¶¶ 6-11). The first two Chambord Agreements were dated June 17, 1993, and Design Labs completed the work under them within four weeks
  
   (see
  
  Fields Aff. ¶¶ 6-7). The third agreement was dated July 27, 1993, and Design Labs completed that work by December 1993
  
   (see
  
  Fields Aff. ¶8). The fourth agreement was dated January 24, 1994, and provided for Design Labs to provide miscellaneous engineering support to Chambord through May 1994 for a monthly retainer
  
   (see
  
  Fields Aff. ¶ 10). Lastly, the fifth agreement, which was executed sometime in May 1994, called for Design Labs to provide consulting services to Chambord on an hourly basis depending on Design Labs’ availability
  
   (see
  
  Fields Aff. ¶ 11).
 

  Design Labs and Chambord also entered into a confidentiality agreement, dated May 27, 1993
  
   (see
  
  Amended Complaint ¶ 39). The confidentiality agreement was to last for five years, but it was superceded by a second confidentiality agreement that was executed in January 1994. Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,
  
   see A.I. Trade Finance, Inc.,
  
  989 F.2d at 79-80, the Court will assume for the purposes of this motion that Arista was either a party to, or the third-party beneficiary of all seven of the contracts.
 

 
   *651
   
  Nevertheless, the Court finds that Design Labs did not transact business in New York State within the meaning of CPLR section 302(a)(1). The two agreements signed by Arista were actually negotiated by Harvey and Fields in California, and Fields executed them in California
  
   (see
  
  Fields Aff., ¶¶ 7-9, Exs. C, E). The other five agreements were negotiated and executed by Fields and Harvey in California (see Fields Aff. ¶¶ 6, 8, 10, 11, Exs. A-G).
  
   See id.
  
  All seven contracts state that they were executed in California and are governed by California law (see Fields Aff. ¶¶ 6-11, Exs. A-G). Design Labs received payment for its work in California (see Fields Aff. ¶ 12). No representative of Design Labs visited Arista’s offices in New York (see Fields Aff. ¶ 9).
 

  In regard to communication between Design Labs and Arista, at most there were several telephone calls between Fields in California and an employee of Arista in New York, and Fields may have spoken to an Arista representative at the CES in Las Vegas
  
   (see
  
  Fields Aff. ¶ 9). All work performed under the contracts was performed in California
  
   (see
  
  Fields Aff. ¶ 12). However, Design Labs did send a prototype to Arista in New York
  
   (see
  
  Declaration of Steven Kayman, Attorney for Arista [hereinafter Kayman Decl.] ¶ 3, Exs. 1, 2).
 

  In addition, Design Labs is a California corporation with its principal place of business in Sacramento, California
  
   (see
  
  Fields Aff. ¶ 1; Amended Complaint ¶ 6). Design Labs does not do business in the State of New York (see Fields Aff. ¶ 14). It maintains no offices, employees, or bank accounts in New York (see Fields Aff. ¶ 14). Design Labs does not advertise or solicit business in New York and does not own or lease real estate in New York (see Fields Aff. ¶ 14). At all times, Fields understood and believed Harvey to be a California resident and Chambord to be a California corporation
  
   (see
  
  Fields Aff. ¶ 4).
  
   See National Telephone Director Consultants v. BellSouth Advertising & Publishing Corp.,
  
  25 F.Supp.2d 192, 196 (S.D.N.Y.1998) (in finding that court did not have personal jurisdiction over defendant, court noted that defendant maintained no offices, employees, property, bank accounts, distribu-ters, mailing addresses, post office boxes, local telephone numbers or registered agents in New York).
 

  This Court finds that Design Labs did not transact business in New York State because all seven contracts were negotiated and signed in California,
  
   cf., Pfeffer v. Mark,
  
  36 F.Supp.2d 556, 559 (E.D.N.Y.1999) (finding that defendant transacted business in New York where contractual relationship was negotiated in New York restaurant and reduced to writing in New York law office); all seven contracts provided for the application of California law; the work under the contracts was performed in California; Fields never traveled to New York to have business discussions with Arista,
  
   cf. Cantor Fitzgerald, L.P. v. Peaslee,
  
  88 F.3d 152 (2d Cir.1996) (noting that meetings held in New York following formation of contractual relationship may confer personal jurisdiction over defendant where meetings are essential to business relationship); and Design Labs was paid in California.
  
   See Agency Rent A Car,
  
  98 F.3d at 29;
  
   Unlimited Care,
  
  42 F.Supp.2d at 331 (finding that defendant did not transact business in New York where contract negotiated in Massachusetts and signed by defendant in Massachusetts; representative of defendant company never visited New York; contract provided for application of Massachusetts law; services were rendered in Massachusetts; defendant received payment in Massachusetts; and contract did not contemplate ongoing contractual relationship with plaintiff company in New York);
  
   National Telephone,
  
  25 F.Supp.2d at 196 (concluding that defendant did not transact business in New York where contract drafted in Georgia; negotiations did not occur in New York; choice-of-law clause provided for application of Georgia law; contract signed by defendant in Georgia; defendant
   
   *652
   
  did not visit plaintiffs New York office);
  
   Worldwide Futgol,
  
  983 F.Supp. at 176-77.
 

  The fact that Design Labs sent a prototype to Arista in New York does not compel a different result, because it is well settled that the consensual mailing of comparable items does not convey jurisdiction over a defendant under CPLR section 302(a)(1).
  
   See Unlimited Care,
  
  42 F.Supp.2d at 331 (holding that defendant’s mailing of payments to plaintiff in New York did not confer jurisdiction);
  
   Worldwide Futgol,
  
  983 F.Supp. at 177 (“New York courts have held that conducting contractual negotiations by phone, fax or mail with a party in New York does not constitute the transaction of business within the state.”).
 

  Moreover, “[kjnowledge that a product may be destined for a particular forum is insufficient, in the context of this case, to sustain jurisdiction.”

   see SBR Realty Corp. v. Pave-Mark Corp.,
  
  175 A.D.2d 240, 241-42, 572 N.Y.S.2d 705, 707 (2nd Dept.1991). Similarly, Design Labs did not transact business in New York by virtue of its receiving a telephone call originated by New York employees of Arista.
  
   See Unlimited Care,
  
  42 F.Supp.2d at 332 (defendant did not actively project itself into New York simply because it received telephone calls from plaintiff New York corporation);
  
   Worldwide Futgol,
  
  983 F.Supp. at 177 (finding lack of personal jurisdiction where defendant’s only contacts with New York were telephone and fax contact with New York plaintiff);

  894 F.Supp. 151, 154 (S.D.N.Y.1995) (defendant’s correspondence with New York plaintiff that was in response to plaintiffs inquiries did not indicate “purposeful availment of benefits and obligations of transacting business in New York”).
 

  Even if Design Labs’ mailing of the prototype and Fields telephone calls with an Arista employee meant that Design Labs transacted business in New York under section 302(a)(1), such an exercise of jurisdiction does not comport with due process guarantees.
  
   See Worldwide Futgol, 983
  
  F.Supp. at 177 (concluding that defendant’s phone calls to New York plaintiff was not “the type of purposeful activity connected with New York that is constitutionally required to confer jurisdiction in New York”). Simply put, “telephone ... and mail between an out-of-state defendant and a New York plaintiff will not confer jurisdiction unless the defendant used the communications as a means of “projecting” themselves into local commerce.”

   Snyder v. Madera Broadcasting, Inc.,
  
  872 F.Supp. 1191, 1194 (E.D.N.Y.1995). Here, the telephone calls from Arista to Design Labs, and Design Labs mailing the prototype to New York do not show that Design Labs has purposely projected itself into New York.
  
   See Roper Starch Worldwide, Inc. v. Reymer & Assocs., Inc.,
  
  2 F.Supp.2d 470, 474-75 (S.D.N.Y.1998) (defendant’s phone calls to New York to ensure fulfillment of contract and defendant’s mailings and faxes to New York did not show that defendant purposely projected himself into New York such that his conduct should confer personal jurisdiction over him). It simply cannot be said that Design Labs’ conduct and connections with New York are such that it could reasonably have anticipated being haled into court here.
  
   See World-Wide Volkswagen v. Woodson,
  
  444 U.S. 286, 297, 100 S.Ct. 559, 62 L.Ed.2d 490 (1980). Nor can it be said that Design Labs purposefully availed itself of the privilege of conducting activities here.
  
   See Hanson v. Denckla,
  
  357 U.S. 235, 253, 78 S.Ct. 1228, 2 L.Ed.2d 1283 (1958);
  
   CutCo Indus., Inc. v. Naughton,

  20 N.Y.2d 377, 382, 283 N.Y.S.2d 34, 229 N.E.2d 604 (1967). Accordingly, the Court finds that Arista has failed to demonstrate a basis for asserting personal jurisdiction under section 302(a)(1).
 

 
   *653
   
  b) Personal Jurisdiction Under Section 302(a)(3)(ii)
 

  Alternatively, Arista attempts to establish a prima facie case for personal jurisdiction under CPLR section 302(a)(3)(ii). This statute states that a defendant is subject to personal jurisdiction when the defendant:
 

  [C]ommits a tortious act without the state causing injury to person or property within the state ... if he:
 

  (ii) expects or should reasonably expect the act to have consequences in the state and derives substantial revenue from interstate or international commerce.
 

  CPLR § 302(a)(3)(ii);
  
   see Domond v. Great American Recreation, Inc.,
  
  116 F.Supp.2d 368, 373 (E.D.N.Y.2000). In order to succeed under this theory, Arista must aver facts that, if credited, would establish (1) the commission of a tort outside of New York; (2) injury within the state; (3) Design Labs’ reasonable expectation that its conduct would have consequences in New York; and (4) that Design Labs derives substantial revenue from interstate commerce.
  
   See
  
  CPLR § 302(a)(3)(ii);
  
   Bank Brussels Lambert v. Fiddler Gonzalez & Rodriguez,
  
  171 F.3d 779, 785 (2d Cir.1999) (noting that plaintiff must aver facts that would suffice to establish, among other thing, commission of tort);
  
   PI Inc. v. Quality Products, Inc.,
  
  907 F.Supp. 752, 760 (S.D.N.Y.1995) (holding that to satisfy New York’s long-arm statute, complaint must frame cause of action in tort).
 

  The Court finds that Arista has failed to allege the commission of a tort outside of New York State, because Arista has merely converted a breach of contract action into a tort claim in order to obtain jurisdiction.
  
   See Bank Brussels Lambert,
  
  171 F.3d at 785;
  
   PI Inc.,
  
  907 F.Supp. at 760. Here, Arista claims that Design Labs fraudulently concealed (1) the fact that it was working for ADLE at the same time that it was working for Arista and (2) the fact that it allegedly was giving Arista’s intellectual property to ADLE
  
   (see
  
  Amended Complaint ¶ 79). Arista claims that it relied on Design Labs’ silence and was injured because it continued to pay Design Labs for the work it thought Design Labs was performing, and because it continued to provide Design Labs with confidential information in the face of Design Labs’ silence
  
   (see
  
  Amended Complaint ¶ 79). In essence, Arista contends that Design Labs concealed its breach of the contract with Arista, and that concealment misled Arista into not taking action with regard to the breach.
 

  However, under New York law, “alleged concealment of a breach is insufficient to transform what would normally be a breach of contract action into one for fraud.”
  
   Reuben H. Donnelley Corp. v. Mark I Marketing Corp.,
  
  893 F.Supp. 285, 290 (S.D.N.Y.1995) (citing
  
   MBW Advertising Network v. Century Business Credit Corp.,

  785 F.Supp. 411, 422 (S.D.N.Y.1992) (“[Failing to disclose a breach of a promise does not transform a contract action into one for fraud.”). Thus, Arista has failed to alleged a cause of action for fraud.
 

  This conclusion is supported by the well-settled principle of New York law that “a party cannot maintain a fraud claim if the alleged fraud is merely the breach of a contract.”

  176 A.D.2d 233, 234, 574 N.Y.S.2d 58, 59 (2d Dept.1991) (holding that where a fraud claim “is premised upon an alleged breach of contractual duties and the supporting allegations do not concern representations which are collateral or extraneous to the terms of the parties’ agreement, a cause of action sounding in fraud does not lie”).
 

  Rather, in order to allege a claim of fraud arising out of a contractual relationship, a plaintiff must not only allege the basic elements of fraud, but also either “(1) a legal duty separate and apart from the contractual duty to perform; (2) a fraudulent representation collateral or extraneous to the contract; or (3) special damages proximately caused by the fraudulent representation that are not recoverable under the contract measure of damages.”

   Pacs Indus. v. Cutler-Hammer, Inc.,
  
  103 F.Supp.2d 570, 571-72 (E.D.N.Y.).
 

  Even reading the complaint in the light most favorable to Arista, the Court cannot discern any legal duty to Arista that Design Labs may have violated that is independent of their duties of good faith and fair dealing implied in the contract.
  
   See New York University,
  
  87 N.Y.2d at 319-20, 639 N.Y.S.2d 283, 662 N.E.2d 763 (“Plaintiffs claim amounts to nothing more than a claim based on the alleged breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and the use of familiar tort language in the pleading does not change the cause of action to a tort claim in the absence of an underlying tort duty sufficient to support a claim for punitive damages”). In addition, Arista does not claim that Design Labs fraudulently concealed information collateral or extraneous to the contract. Rather, Arista contends that Design Labs failed to disclose its breach of the contract. Lastly, Arista has not alleged the existence of any special damages that would not be recoverable under a contract theory.
 

  Thus, Arista’s tort claim is clearly dupli-cative of its cause of action for breach of contract. Because Arista has not adequately alleged a tort, it failed to satisfy all of the requirements of the long-arm statute.
  
   Bank Brussels Lambert,
  
  171 F.3d at 785;
  
   PI,
  
  907 F.Supp. at 760. Accordingly, CPLR section 302(a)(3)(ii) does not support the exercise of personal jurisdiction over Design Labs.
 

  C. Motion to Dismiss by ADLE for Lack of Subject Matter Jurisdiction
 

  ADLE moves to dismiss Count V of the Amended Complaint, in which Arista seeks a declaratory judgment that ADLE’s U.S. Patent No. 5,333,091 (the “091 Patent”) is invalid. Subject matter jurisdiction over a claim for declaratory judgment of patent invalidity requires an “actual controversy” which is “of sufficient immediacy and reality” to warrant judicial action.
  
   EMC Corp. v. Norand Corp.,
  
  89 F.3d 807, 810 (Fed.Cir.1996). Where a patent owner has granted a plaintiff a covenant
  
   not
  
  to sue for present activity that would place the plaintiff at risk of infringement liability, dismissal is required for lack of an actual controversy.
  
   See Super Sack Mfg. Corp. v. Chase Packaging Corp.,
  
  57 F.3d 1054, 1058 (Fed.Cir.1995). This is true even where the covenant does not cover future products, because a present controversy is lacking.
  
   See Amana Refrigeration, Inc. v. Quadlux, Inc.,
  
  172 F.3d 852, 855 (Fed.Cir.1999).
 

  ADLE submitted to the Court an affidavit of Bernard J. Lacomis, president of ADLE, in which Mr. Lacomis “provides to Arista a covenant not to sue for infringement of the ’091 patent”
  
   (see
  
  Reply Affidavit of Bernard J. Lacomis and Expanded Covenant Not to Sue [hereinafter Expanded Covenant], pp. 1-2). The only two limitations on the covenant are as follows: “(a) The Covenant is limited to
   
   *655
   
  the ’091 patent, and does not constitute an implied covenant under any other patent[; and] (b) [t]he Covenant is conditioned upon the withdrawal or dismissal of Arista’s claim for a declaratory judgment regarding the validity of the ’091 patent.” The Court finds that the Expanded Covenant is unrestricted and constitutes a promise by ADLE not to sue Arista for any past, present, or future infringements of the ’091 patent. This interpretation is supported by statements made by ADLE’s counsel at oral argument, where he stated on the record that the covenant was unrestricted and would apply to any past, present, or future infringements by Arista.
 

  Because ADLE has provided Arista with an unlimited and unrestricted covenant not to sue, this Court finds that no controversy survives the covenant.
  
   See Super Sack,
  
  57 F.3d at 1058. Thus, the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over Count V of the Amended Complaint, and that Count is dismissed.

  Arista seeks leave of the Court to file a Second Amended Complaint which is not different from the amended Complaint in any meaningful way. With respect to the material portions of Count II, the Second Amended Complaint is as vague as the Amended Complaint. Arista’s changes are perfunctory and cosmetic and fail to allege any additional statements by Iggulden that would constitute an affirmative misrepresentation. Accordingly, the Second Amended Complaint fails to plead the dismissed fraud claim with the particularity required by Rule 9(b), and the changes advanced are futile.
 

  In regard to Counts III and IV, the Second Amended Complaint does not allege any additional facts that would support a finding that Design Labs has transacted business in New York State within the meaning of CPLR section 302(a)(1). In addition, Arista’s tort claim in the Second Amended Complaint remains duplica-tive of the breach of contract claim. Because the Second Amended Complaint does not cure any of the deficiencies in the Amended Complaint, the Court finds that it is futile and denies leave to file it.

1162556,1162556,563325,Salaz v. City of Tucson,"Evaristo SALAZ, Plaintiff/Appellee/Cross-Appellant, v. CITY OF TUCSON, a Municipal Corporation, Defendant/Appellant/Cross-Appellee","

  OPINION
 

  FERNANDEZ, Judge.
 

  The issue on appeal in this inverse condemnation case is the propriety of the court’s award of attorney’s fees against the City of Tucson. On cross-appeal, the issue presented is the propriety of the court’s dismissal of appellee Evaristo Sa-laz’s cause of action against the City brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983. We reverse the award of attorney’s fees and affirm the dismissal.
 

  This case arose out of the construction of water drainage improvements on the Coronado Ridge Wash. Salaz owned property located directly across Speedway Boulevard from a large parcel of land owned by Fairfield Communities, Inc. Although it is unclear from the record before us, it appears that the wash runs through both properties. Fairfield sought to develop its property, but the City of Tucson refused to give the required approvals until Fairfield secured an easement from Salaz for a downstream right-of-way. After negotiations, Salaz refused to sell any right-of-way to Fairfield. Thereafter, Fairfield and the City agreed in writing that the City would condemn a portion of Salaz’s property, if necessary, and Fairfield would reimburse the City for its acquisition costs. The drainage improvements were then constructed.
 

  Salaz initially filed suit against Fairfield Sunrise Village, Inc., for trespass and nuisance and then sued Fairfield Communities, Inc., and the City of Tucson on various other theories, including a cause of action against the City for violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The City then filed suit to condemn the property. The consolidated cases were tried to a jury, resulting in a verdict of $231,700 against the City for the value of Salaz’s land and a verdict of $400,000 against both Fairfield corporations as compensation for his personal injuries. In the condemnation portion of the case, the court awarded Salaz attorney’s fees against the City in the amount of $31,500. Prior to trial, the court dismissed Salaz’s § 1983 action against the City. Salaz sought special action relief from that dismissal, and this court declined to accept jurisdiction.
 

  ATTORNEY’S FEE AWARD
 

  In Arizona, attorney’s fees are recoverable only if they are permitted by the express provisions of a statute or by agreement.
  
   United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co. v. Frohmiller,
  
  71 Ariz. 377, 227 P.2d 1007 (1951);
  
   State Farm Mutual Automo
  
 
   *253
   

   bile Insurance Co. v. O’Brien,
  
  24 Ariz.App. 18, 535 P.2d 46 (1975). Arizona’s direct condemnation statutes contain no provision for an award of attorney’s fees. A.R.S. §§ 12-1111 through 12-1128. An inverse condemnation action is governed by the same statutes as a direct condemnation action.
  
   State v. Hollis,
  
  93 Ariz. 200, 379 P.2d 750 (1963).
 

  There is a limited statutory basis for the award of attorney’s fees in certain inverse condemnation cases under A.R.S. § 11-972(B). However, that statute is specifically limited by § 11-974 which provides as follows:
 

  This article may apply and be utilized by any acquiring agency by action of the governing or legislative body thereof and shall apply to all acquiring agencies when real property or improvements thereon are acquired or are to be acquired for a project for which federal financial assistance is to defray all, or part of, the costs of such project.
 

  Salaz made no showing to the trial court that the City’s governing body has utilized that article. Therefore, the only basis for an attorney’s fee award in this case would be the use of federal funds to defray all or part of the costs of the project. The record is devoid of any evidence that federal funds were used in the project. Instead, the record shows that Fairfield agreed to reimburse the City for all expenses incurred to acquire Salaz’s property and for the engineering costs of the improvements. Fair-field also agreed to pay 50% of the construction costs. We refuse to accept Sa-laz’s suggestion that the trial court must have presumed that, since a part of the project involved street work on Speedway Boulevard, federal funds would be involved.
 

  A.R.S. § 11-972(A) also provides for an award of attorney’s fees if the final judgment determines that the acquiring agency cannot acquire the real property by condemnation or if the proceeding is abandoned by the acquiring agency. Neither of those conditions exists in this case; therefore, § 11-972(A) does not apply. See
  
   All American Pipeline Co. v. Klump,
  
  153 Ariz. 607, 739 P.2d 828 (App.1987).
 

  We reverse the award of attorney’s fees, since we find no basis for the award under Arizona law.
 

  § 1983 CLAIM
 

  Salaz does not challenge the adequacy of his state law damage remedies available here and in fact sought and recovered damages in the condemnation action. Since there is no deprivation of his constitutional or statutory rights, there is no violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1983.
  
   Atkinson v. City of Fort Collins, Colorado,
  
  583 F.Supp. 567 (D.Colo.1984).
 

  There was no showing of any deliberate misuse of the City’s eminent domain powers, as was the case in
  
   Foster v. City of Detroit,
  
  405 F.2d 138 (6th Cir.1968), and
  
   Foster v. Herley,
  
  330 F.2d 87 (6th Cir.1964), neither of which was brought under § 1983. Nor do we find
  
   Lake Country Estates, Inc. v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency,
  
  440 U.S. 391, 99 S.Ct. 1171, 59 L.Ed.2d 401 (1979), applicable here.
 

  Reversed as to the award of attorney’s fees; affirmed as to the dismissal of Sa-laz’s § 1983 action.

"
6381287,6507812,63437596,Commonwealth v. Stewart,Commonwealth v. Stewart,"
Windle, P. J.,
The question raised by this appeal is whether appellant’s right to receive the net income for her life from two New York trusts is taxable by this State as an equitable interest in certain of the securities comprising the corpus of the trusts, under the terms of the State Personal Property Tax Act of June 22, 1935, P. L. 414, as amended by the Act of July 17, 1936, P. L. 51. Section 3 of the act provides for a personal property tax on “the equitable interest in any such personal *669property of the classes hereinafter enumerated [no question is raised in this regard], owned, held or possessed by any resident, where the legal title to such personal property is vested in a trustee, agent, or attorney-in-fact domiciled in another state, and where such resident is entitled to receive all or any part of the income therefrom . . .”.
Appellant, a resident of this county, is the beneficiary for life of two trusts created by her mother, a resident of New York, by irrevocable deeds of trust, in 1917 and 1926. The trustees are the Guaranty Trust Company of New York, a New York corporation, and two brothers of appellant, both residents of New York. The bonds and certificates of stock representing the corpus of the trust estate are, and have always been, kept in New York. The trustees have full power and authority over the investment of the assets of the trust estate during the life of the trust. On the termination of appellant’s life the corpus is disposed of by the trust deeds in the manner therein provided to appellant’s children or their issue or to other children of grantor or their issue. No power whatever is given appellant in that respect.
Appellant bases her appeal on the grounds that her right to receive income from the two trusts involved is not an equitable interest in any of the personal property of the classes enumerated in the statute in those trusts ' within the meaning of the State Personal Property Tax Act, supra; and that, if it is, the acts offend against the “due process” clauses of the Constitutions of the United States and of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and against the tax uniformity clause of the latter-mentioned instrument. The appeal must be sustained on the ground first mentioned.
The tax here in question is a tax on property — not ah income tax. Unless, therefore, appellant has a property right in the securities upon which this tax is sought to be imposed, she may not be required to pay it. We are of opinion she has no such property therein. Her right under *670the terms of her mother’s deeds is merely to receive from the trustees the income from the securities in question, when, if, and as said income is earned and received by them and after it has been reduced by the payment of expenses and commissions. She has no control over the investments and the management of the trust or over the disposition of the trust assets during her lifetime or after her death. She can never reduce them to her possession or the possession of her nominees or appointees. Her right is the bare one of receiving net income. Under those circumstances we can find no right of property in any of the trust securities to be in appellant.
The right of property connotes ownership. What muniments of ownership has appellant in the securities here taxed? She may not control them in any way, gain possession of them ever, or dispose of them or their proceeds or substituted investments by sale or gift while alive or by will after her death. True, she must receive the income from them during her life, but is that the only controlling factor here? We think not. We believe that more than that latter fact must exist to establish a right of property in trust assets and that no interest, equitable or otherwise, that is the subject of taxation under the acts in question, is by it alone created. Appellant’s interest as a property right that can be the subject of a tax extends no further than to income. She is the owner of that and when it is in the hands of her trustees before being paid to her they are holding it as trustees for her. They have legal title thereto as such trustees, but she has an equitable interest therein that amounts to a right of property in it, but not in that which produced the income. She can, in a court of equity, compel the trustees to pay the income in their hands to her, thus reducing it to her possession, just as the vendee of real estate under an agreement of sale, vested with equitable title in the realty by virtue thereof, can compel conveyance to him, or his nominee, of the legal title held in trust for him by the vendor. This, however, she cannot do as to the corpus of *671the trusts or any part thereof. Since the effort here is to tax her property right not in income but in the principal of the trusts, it cannot prevail.
We have read the cases cited by counsel in their briefs filed. We find no cases in this State that are in point. In Spangler v. York County, 13 Pa. 322, 328, the court intimates by certain language used that a life beneficiary of a fund who has no power of disposition thereof has no “distinct estate or property in the fund itself”. In New York, by statute, it is provided that “the persons for whose benefit a trust is created shall take no estate or interest in the lands but may enforce the performance of the trust in equity”, and on the strength of that situation was Archer-Shee v. Garland, L. R. [1931] A. C. 212, decided in England. That language is broad enough to cover trusts not so limited as to disposition and control of the corpus as those before us. We believe it states a sound rule of law at least as regards them. Uncontrolled as we are by the doctrine of stare decisis, we are adopting and applying it to the present situation in the belief that on principle and logic it is basically correct. We find nothing to the contrary in the law of this State.
The A. L. I. Restatement of Trusts, see. 2, com. (/), is of little help in this connection. There it says that the beneficiary of a trust has an equitable interest in the subject matter of the trust and goes on to define an equitable interest as “that kind of interest which has its origin in the principles, standards and rules developed by courts of chancery”. Whether it is a property right it does not pretend to say.
In the case of Brooke v. City of Norfolk et al., 277 U. S. 27, decided in 1928, the court, where the beneficiary, a resident in Virginia, of a trust created and maintained in Maryland, was assessed with a tax on the whole corpus of the trust, says:
“But here the property is not within the State, does not belong to the petitioner [beneficiary] and is not within her possession or control. The assessment is a bare *672proposition to make the petitioner pay upon an interest to which she is a stranger. This cannot he done.” (Italics supplied.)
Apparently, then, the Supreme Court of the United States believes that one in the situation of this applicant has no taxable interest in the assets of the trusts.
On the whole, we are of opinion that on principle and logic, as well as authority in other jurisdictions, the sound view of the law here involved is that appellant’s rights under her mother’s deeds of trust do not constitute a property right or interest in the securities of the trust fund that can be the subject of taxation under the terms of the act of assembly above mentioned and here relied on by the Commonwealth. The assessment made and now appealed from therefore cannot be sustained.
Had a contrary conclusion been reached, however, and it had been held that appellant has a property right in securities of the trust, we believe the Commonwealth’s contention is answered by the decision in the case of City of Baltimore v. Gibbs, 166 Md. 364, 171 Atl. 37, decided in 1934 in the Court of Appeals of Maryland. There, on facts different from those before us, it was not denied that appellee, a resident of Baltimore, had a property right in the corpus of a trust created by her, held and operated in Pittsburgh, from which she received the income for life. It was held by the court that such interest was not taxable in Maryland under a statute containing provisions not different in principle from the acts under consideration here. A writ of certiorari was denied by the Supreme Court of the United States on October 8, 1934 (293 U. S. 559, 55 S. C. 71). In the opinion of the Maryland court, the cases chiefly relied on by the Commonwealth here are discussed and differentiated. In our belief, the law as expounded in that case, confirmed as it is by the Supreme Court, is controlling in the matter before us and disposes of the constitutional question raised under the so-called “due process” clauses of both the Federal and State Constitutions (Constitution of United *673States, amendment XIV, sec. 1; Constitution of Pennsylvania, art. I, see. 10) in manner unfavorable to the Commonwealth.
In view of the above, the question of the uniformity of the tax under amendment XIV, sec. 1, need not be considered.
Appeal sustained.

8619007,8639457,65904863,Sorkin v. Board of Governors of State Colleges & Universities,Roberta Sorkin v. Board of Governors of State Colleges and Universities," Roe, C. J. This claim arises out of an incident which occurred on June 29, 1973 on the premises of Northeastern Illinois University which is located at St. Louis and Bryn Mawr Avenues, Chicago, Illinois. On said day the Claimant, Roberta Sorkin, arrived at the campus at approximately 4:30 p.m. alone with the intention of obtaining an application for summer classes from the Administration Building. At approximately 5:00 p.m. Claimant approached two concrete steps between a classroom building and the Commuter Center. The steps were constructed such that the top step of the two overhung the lower one, i.e. a gap existed between the top and bottom step. As Claimant ascended the steps her right foot caught the edge of the overhang which caused her to trip and break the fifth metatarsal bone in her right foot. In her complaint Claimant charged Respondent with the duty to exercise ordinary care in the maintenance of the premises to avoid injuries to persons lawfully on the premises and with the breach of that duty in one or more of the following ways: (a) allowing the stairway to deteriorate, (b) maintaining a gap in said stairway which Respondent knew, or should have known, that persons going up or down said stairs could catch their feet thereon and trip, (c) failing to repair said stairway when Respondent knew or should have known of its dangerous condition, and (d) otherwise carelessly and negligently operating said premises. After carefully examining all the testimony and other evidence put forth in this case we find that the Respondent breached no duty owed to Claimant. Furthermore, the evidence tended to indicate that the accident, if caused by the negligence of anybody, was caused by Claimant’s own negligence. As to Claimant’s first and third allegation of negligence we find that the steps in question had not deteriorated or otherwise fallen into a state of disrepair. This fact is quite obvious from Claimant’s exhibits numbers 2, 4, 5, 6. Said exhibits are pictures of the steps which Claimant testified accurately portrayed their condition at the time of the accident. They clearly show the steps to have been in good condition. As to the second and fourth allegation of negligence we do not feel that Respondent acted or failed to act other than with ordinary care in the maintenance of the steps. By Claimant’s own admission the gap referred to was in fact a characteristic of the design of the particular steps. The pictures of the steps also support this finding. Furthermore we take judicial notice of the fact that a large number of stairways in both the public and private sector are similarly constructed. Many stairways do not have any vertical support at all except for at the edges. To hold the State liable for the accident here would, in effect, be making the State an insurer of the public which we have consistently refused to do. Furthermore the evidence showed that the bottom step was between twelve and fifteen inches from front to back. In our opinion this is sufficient space for the secure placing of one’s foot in the act of ascending the steps without having to insert the foot beneath the overhang of the top step. We find Respondent acted with ordinary care in all respects. Although the findings have sufficed to deny the claim, there is also evidence which tends to show that the Claimant was a cause of her own accident. The accident took place during daylight hours on a sunny day. There was no evidence of any foreign substance, sticky or slippery. Claimant was familiar with the condition of the steps. She testified to having observed the steps from a distance of forty feet immediately prior to the accident and kept on walking, looking straight ahead, and did not look at them again until she was directly on top of them. A witness, Claimant’s sister, testified that Claimant was looking straight ahead at the time she fell. There was also testimony that Claimant had been aware of the steps for some time prior to the accident. Claimant had graduated from the university and had attended classes there for eight or nine months. She testified that three months prior to the accident she had observed the gap while sitting with classmates in the area of the steps. Because of failure of Claimant to prove breach of duty it is hereby ordered that this claim be, and hereby is denied. "

  MARTIN (Harry C.), Judge.
 

  These appeals result from proceedings under N.C.G.S. 15A-979(b). The evidence produced at the hearing on the motions to suppress tended to show that quantities of marijuana were seized by law enforcement officers in the house, barn, other outbuildings, and from the open fields of property referred to as “Wood’s Dairy Farm” in Lenoir County. The officers did not have a search warrant. Defendants Grimes, Prevette, and Stafford were arrested in the house. St. John was arrested in a cornfield, after apparently fleeing from the house. Sutton was arrested in his truck as he approached the area; he was never at the house. The record does not disclose where or when defendant Wood was arrested.
 

  The record on appeal contains the following:
 

  It was stipulated in open Court that the defendants, each and all of them, having standing to challenge the validity of the searches and seizures conducted by the officers on behalf of the State, on Constitutional grounds, and standing to object to the admission into evidence of any and all items, articles, and substances seized, and standing to insist that the same, and evidence of the same, be excluded. Relying upon the foregoing stipulation, no testimony was offered on Voir Dire by the defendants; the defendants’ only evidence consisted of Exhibits Nos. 4, 5 and 6, which were offered and
   
   *472
   
  received in evidence after the identification of said exhibits by State’s witnesses on cross examination.
 

  The State and defendants attempted to stipulate as to a question of law. Stipulations as to questions of law are generally held invalid and ineffective, and not binding upon the courts, either trial or appellate. 73 Am. Jur. 2d Stipulations § 5 (1974); 5 Am. Jur. 2d Appeal and Error § 712 (1962). This rule is more important in criminal cases, where the interests of the public are involved. The due administration of the criminal law cannot be left to the stipulations of the parties.
  
   Young v. United States,
  
  315 U.S. 257, 86 L.Ed. 832 (1942).
 

  Standing to object involves more than rising to address the court. The standing of a defendant to raise a constitutional issue is a question of law. In a case involving the standing of taxpayers to challenge the constitutionality of a statute, our Supreme Court held, “Standing, however, like jurisdiction, cannot be conferred by stipulation. . . . [W]hether the party has standing to attack the constitutionality of a statute is a question of law, which may not be settled by the parties.”

  The record before us does not contain facts necessary to determine whether defendants (or either of them) had an interest in connection with the searched premises that gave rise to “a reasonable expectation of freedom from governmental intrusion” upon those premises.

  394 U.S. 165, 22 L.Ed. 2d 176 (1969). Defendant must show that he has a legitimate and reasonable expectation of privacy in the areas which were the subject of the search or seizure he seeks to contest.

  --- U.S. ---, 99 S.Ct. 421, 58 L.Ed. 3d 387 (1978).
 

  Defendants relied upon the stipulation and did not introduce any evidence to establish their standing to object to the search.
   
   *473
   
  Fairness to defendants will not allow us to deprive them of an opportunity to do so.
 

  Since there has not been any factual determination of whether defendants (or either of them) had an interest in the searched premises that was protectible under the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution, we remand the cases to the superior court for this purpose.

MEMORANDUM AND ORDER
CAMBRIDGE, Chief Judge.
This matter is before the Court on Magistrate Judge Piester’s Report and Recommendation (filing 17). No objections to such report and recommendation have been filed as allowed by 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(C) and NELR 72.4.
The Court has reviewed the Magistrate Judge’s Report and Recommendation pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1) and NELR 72.4 and finds after de novo review that the report and recommendation should be adopted. As a result, Defendant’s motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction will be denied. Accordingly,
IT IS ORDERED:
1. The Magistrate Judge’s Report and Recommendation (filing 17) is adopted; and
2. Defendant’s motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(h)(3) (filing 8) is denied.
MEMORANDUM, ORDER, AND RECOMMENDATION
PIESTER, United States Magistrate Judge.
Before the court for consideration are defendant’s motion to dismiss (filing 8) and plaintiffs motion to disqualify defense counsel (filing 15). For the reasons discussed below, I shall recommend that defendant’s motion to dismiss be denied and shall farther deny plaintiffs motion to disqualify.
In its motion to dismiss1 defendant asserts that the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over this action because the amount in controversy does not satisfy the provisions of 28 U.S.C. § 1332(a).
A complaint that alleges in good faith a jurisdictional amount in excess of $50,000 will suffice to confer diversity jurisdiction upon the court. Larkin v. Brown, 41 F.3d 387, 388 (8th Cir.1994); 28 U.S.C. § 1332. However, where the defendant questions the legitimacy of the alleged amount, the plaintiff has the burden of proving the requisite *872amount. State of Mo. ex rel. Pemiscot Cty. v. Western Sur., 51 F.3d 170, 173 (8th Cir.1995). If it “appear[s] to a legal certainty that the claim is really for less than the jurisdictional amount,” the complaint will be dismissed. Larkin, supra (quoting St. Paul Mercury Indemnity Co. v. Red Cab Co., 303 U.S. 283, 289, 58 S.Ct. 586, 590, 82 L.Ed. 845 (1938)).
Plaintiff seeks recovery of fees and expenses arising from its representation of Harold E. Cluck in a previous lawsuit against the defendant. Cluck v. Union Pacific, 7:CV91-164. In its complaint, filed May 10, 1995, plaintiff specifically prays for “43,750.00 in attorney’s fees owed in regard to its representation of Harold E. Cluck against defendant” and for “24,485.58 in expenses incurred in regal’d to its representation of Harold E. Cluck against defendant.” (See filing 1.) Also in its complaint plaintiff alleges that defendant “acknowledged as reasonable” the $43,750 in attorney’s fees by depositing that amount with the clerk of this court. (Id. at ¶ 9.) An exhibit submitted with the complaint suggests that, on or about August 30, 1994, defendant did, in fact, deposit a sight draft in the amount of $43,750 with the clerk’s office “representing payment of the lien of Morris B. Chapman & Associates.” (Id. at Exhibit D.)
In its motion to dismiss defendant maintains that because it “has already offered, and attempted to pay, the sum of $43,750 to the Plaintiff,” that amount is not in controversy. (Filing 8.) Defendant further maintains that the remaining damages prayed for in plaintiff’s complaint are not sufficient to satisfy the jurisdictional requirement. Id.
The amount-in-eontroversy requirement in actions brought pursuant to this court’s diversity jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. § 1332, must be satisfied at the time the complaint is filed. See e.g. Zunamon v. Brown, 418 F.2d 883, 887 (8th Cir.1969); LFC Lessors, Inc. v. Pacific Sewer Maint. Corp., 739 F.2d 4 (1st Cir.1984); Lindsey v. M.A. Zeccola & Sons, Inc., 26 F.3d 1236 (3rd Cir.1994). The mere admission or acknowledgment by the defendant that an amount claimed in the complaint is actually due and owing to the plaintiff does not remove that amount from the jurisdictional calculation. Wheel Horse Sales, Inc. v. Spence, 566 F.2d 679, 681 (10th Cir.1977); Peoples Westchester Sav. Bank v. Ganc, 705 F.Supp. 164, 166 (S.D.N.Y.1989); United Bonding Ins. Co. v. Parke, 293 F.Supp. 1350, 1351-52 (E.D.Mo.1968). Likewise, part payment of a claimed amount, after a suit has been commenced, does not remove that amount from the calculation. Landry v. A-Able Bonding, Inc., 870 F.Supp. 715 (E.D.Tex.1994); Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Whiteford Systems, Inc., 787 F.Supp. 766 (S.D.Ohio 1992). However, where an unconditional payment is made to the plaintiff prior to commencement of the action, the amount paid cannot be said to be in controversy. See Ganc, supra.
As noted above, plaintiff filed its complaint on May 10,1995. By that time, defendant had already deposited $43,750 with the clerk’s office “representing payment of the Ken of Morris B. Chapman & Associates.” (See Filing 1, Exhibit D.) Defendant, apparently by virtue of that deposit, claims that it “ha[d] already offered, and attempted to pay, the sum of $43,750 to the Plaintiff.” (Filing 8.) Plaintiff argues that the deposit was merely an acknowledgment of partial KabiKty and that, as such, the amount should not be removed from the jurisdictional calculation. (Plaintiffs Brief, at 3.) Further, plaintiff submits an affidavit, in which plaintiffs attorney asserts that “[n]o part of the $43,750.00 contingency fee ... has been paid to Plaintiff by Defendant or any other party.” (Filing 11.)
Defendant offers nothing to contradict the sworn statement of plaintiffs attorney which indicates that actual payment to plaintiff of the $43,750 has never been made. Nor does defendant contend that plaintiff could have accessed the money deposited with the clerk’s office without foreclosing itself from seeking further amounts from the defendant. Based on these facts, I am unable to conclude to a “legal certainty” that plaintiffs claim is really for less than the jurisdictional amount. I shall therefore recommend that defendant’s motion to dismiss be denied. Larkin, supra.
In its motion to disqualify defense counsel, plaintiff claims that representation *873by attorney Raymond Hasiak and the entire Legal Department of Defendant Union Pacific Railroad Company constitutes a violation of Disciplinary Rule 6-102 of the Nebraska Code of Professional Responsibility because “it is obvious” that Hasiak will be called as a witness on behalf of defendant or as an adverse witness by plaintiff. Disciplinary Rule 5-102 provides:
(A) If, after undertaking employment in contemplated or pending litigation, a lawyer learns or it is obvious that he or a lawyer in his firm ought to be called as a witness on behalf of his client, he shall withdraw from the conduct of the trial and his firm, if any, shall not continue representation in the trial, except that he may continue the representation and he or a lawyer in his firm may testify in the circumstances enumerated in DR 5 — 101(B)(1) through (4).
(B) If, after undertaking employment in contemplated or pending litigation, a lawyer learns or it is obvious that he or a lawyer in his firm may be called as a witness other than on behalf of his client, he may continue the representation until it is apparent that his testimony is or may be prejudicial to his client.
Code of Professional Responsibility, DR 5-102.2
Under the foregoing rules, an attorney is only required to withdraw in the following situations: (1) where he or someone in his firm “ought to be called as a witness on behalf of his client;” or (2) where he or someone in his firm “may be called as a witness other than on behalf of his client” and “his testimony is or may be prejudicial to his client.”
Plaintiff asserts that Hasiak is listed as a possible defense witness in the initial disclosures of the defendant. (Filing 16, Exhibit A.) Plaintiff further asserts that Has-iak is the only representative of Union Pacific with information concerning the issues in this ease. (Filing 16, at ¶ 6.) Plaintiff thus concludes that “[i]t is apparent” that Hasiak will be called as a witness. (Filing 16, at ¶ 7.) However, at this point, it has not been established that Hasiak or others in his firm necessarily will be called to testify on behalf of Union Pacific. Further, there is no evidence, at this point, indicating that the testimony of Hasiak or others in his firm, if called as witnesses on behalf of plaintiff, would be prejudicial to Union Pacific. Thus, there is no need to disqualify defense counsel at this time. I shall therefore deny the motion to disqualify.
IT THEREFORE HEREBY IS ORDERED that plaintiff’s motion to disqualify defense counsel (filing 16) is denied.
FURTHER, IT THEREFORE HEREBY IS RECOMMENDED to the Honorable William G. Cambridge, Chief United States District Judge, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(B), that defendant’s motion to dismiss (filing 8) be denied.
The parties are notified that unless objection is made within ten days after being served with a copy of this recommendation, they may be held to have waived any right they may have to appeal the court’s order adopting this recommendation.
Dated December 27,1995.

  OPINION
 

  GREENWOOD, Judge:
 

  Defendant Dale Phillip Taylor appeals his conviction of aggravated assault, a third degree felony, in violation of Utah Code Ann. § 76-5-103 (1990). We affirm.
 

 
   *1295
   
  FACTS
  
   1
  


  On the morning of June 21, 1993, defendant entered Fankhauser Jewelry in Salt Lake City, with two rings he had found a few days earlier in a laundromat. One ring contained badly worn blue stones, while the other was made of 14 karat gold, and contained a karat-sized stone. Fankhauser Jewelry is owned by Miriam Davis (Davis) and her husband, Gary Davis. Their daughter, Linda Davis (Linda), is also employed at the store, and all three were present the day in question.
 

  Defendant testified at trial that he asked Davis for appraisals on both rings, since he did not know their value. Davis testified that defendant entered the store claiming to have a diamond ring belonging to his wife, although defendant denied making the statement. Davis examined the first ring and returned it to defendant, telling him it was worthless. However, Davis thought the ring with the karat-sized stone was of some value. Davis looked at the ring, cleaned it, examined it with a jeweler’s magnifier, and measured the size of the stone. Davis showed the ring to her husband, who also examined it.
 

  Davis offered to buy the ring from defendant for $3,000 in cash and merchandise. Defendant accepted, and in exchange for the ring received a check for $1,275, a $975 men’s ring, and a $750 gold-filled watch. Davis was not sure if there were sufficient funds in her account to cover the check, so she asked defendant not to cash the check until the next day. Defendant agreed. Nonetheless, after defendant left the store, he went to a bank and, learning that the account had sufficient funds, cashed the check.
 

  After defendant left the store, Davis used a diamond tester to more carefully examine the ring. The diamond tester indicated that instead of a one karat diamond, the ring contained a karat-sized cubic zirconium stone worth ten to fifteen dollars. Davis attempted to stop payment on the check, but it had already been cashed.
 

  About three hours later, defendant returned to Fankhauser Jewelry to have the watch adjusted. Linda told defendant the ring did not contain a diamond and demanded that defendant return the cash and merchandise. Defendant insisted the stone was genuine and refused to observe a testing of the ring. Defendant then told Davis that the cash he had received for the ring was in his ear and he would get it. Defendant left the store and proceeded to walk around the corner towards the parking lot. Linda followed defendant out of the store and to his ear. As they approached his car, defendant told Linda the money was not in his car, but in his bank.
 

  As defendant opened his car door, Linda put her hands up to keep the door from hitting her. Defendant started his car, but Linda turned off the ignition. Defendant grabbed Linda’s arms, shaking them and slamming them into the steering wheel several times. Defendant then threw Linda to the ground, started his car, and began backing his car towards her. Linda was forced to move to avoid being hit. Defendant then drove his car forward towards Linda, forcing her to move away a second time.
 

  Defendant was arrested and charged with two counts: (1) theft by deception, in violation of Utah Code Ann. § 76-6-^405 (1990); and (2) aggravated assault, in violation of Utah Code Ann. § 76-5-103 (1990). After the State concluded presenting its case-in-chief, defendant moved that the trial court dismiss the charges against him, arguing insufficiency of evidence. The trial court denied the motion to dismiss the aggravated assault charge, and took under advisement the motion to dismiss the theft by deception charge. As a result, defendant had to present to the jury his case regarding theft by deception.
 

  During cross-examination of defendant, the prosecutor asked what had happened to the property defendant received in exchange for the ring. The prosecutor also alluded to a pawn ticket from the state of Washington indicating defendant pawned the merchandise soon after the incident. However, the State did not offer the pawn ticket into evi
   
   *1296
   
  dence. Nevertheless, defendant admitted to pawning the merchandise in Washington. Finally, defendant was asked whether he disagreed with Davis’s testimony regarding the origin of the ring, which conflicted with his own testimony.
 

  At the conclusion of the trial, the jury retired to deliberate both counts against defendant. After four hours, the jury reached a verdict on the aggravated assault charge but could not agree on the theft by deception charge. After another hour of deliberation, the jury returned a verdict of guilty on the aggravated assault charge, but was still unable to reach a verdict on the theft by deception charge. Defendant again requested a ruling on the motion to dismiss the theft by deception charge. The trial court denied the motion and declared a mistrial as to the theft by deception charge.
 

  ISSUES
 

  Defendant raises the following issues on appeal: (1) Did the trial court err in not granting the motion to dismiss the theft by deception charge? (2) Did the trial court err by not promptly ruling on the motion to dismiss? and (3) Did prosecutorial misconduct occur at trial? Defendant argues all three constitute reversible’ error because they impacted the jury’s guilty verdict on the aggravated assault charge.
 

  STANDARD OF REVIEW
 

  A trial court’s ruling on a motion to dismiss is a question of law.
  
   State v. Maestas,
  
  652 P.2d 903, 905 (Utah 1982). Therefore, this court reviews the trial court’s decision for correctness, with no particular deference to its legal conclusions.
  
   State v. Mickelson,
  
  848 P.2d 677, 684 (Utah App.1992).
 

  The test for determining whether a prosecutor’s statements at trial constitute error is whether the remarks “called to the jurors’ attention matters which they would not be justified in considering in reaching a verdict.”
  
   State v. Emmett,
  
  839 P.2d 781, 785 (Utah 1992) (quoting
  
   State v. Johnson,
  
  663 P.2d 48, 51 (Utah 1983)). Only if the improper statements are deemed to be harmful will they require reversal.
  
   Id.
  


  ANALYSIS
 

  Motion to Dismiss Theft by Deception Charge
 

  Defendant argues that the State did not establish a prima facie case of theft by deception because there was not sufficient evidence on the required elements. Thus, the trial judge erred in not granting defendant’s motion to dismiss. The State, conversely, argues that the jury could have found proof of all of the elements of theft by deception from the evidence presentee] at trial.
 

  In determining whether there is sufficient evidence to send a case to the jury, the court uses the same standard as for a claim of insufficient evidence to support a jury verdict.
  
   State v. Dibello,
  
  780 P.2d 1221, 1225 (Utah 1989). In
  
   Dibello,
  
  defendant appealed a second degree murder conviction, contending there was insufficient evidence to warrant sending the case to the jury. In concluding the trial court did not err, the
  
   Dibello
  
  court noted that appellate courts should “uphold the trial court’s decision if, upon reviewing the evidence and all inferences that can be reasonably drawn from it, [the court] concluded] that some evidence exists from which a reasonable jury could find that the elements of the crime had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.”
  
   Id.
  
  Additionally, the evidence is to be viewed in a fight most favorable to the State.
  
   State v. Iverson,
  
  10 Utah 2d 171, 350 P.2d 152, 153 (1960). In viewing the evidence in this fight, if “the jury acting fairly and reasonably could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, the judge is required to submit the case to the jury for determination of the guilt or innocence of defendant.”
  
   Id.
  


  The Utah theft by deception statute reads in part as follows: “[a] person commits theft if he obtains or exercises control over property of another by deception and with a purpose to deprive him thereof.” Utah Code Ann. § 76-6-405 (1990). This court has previously ruled that “deception” has three separate components.
  
   State v. LeFevre,
  
  825 P.2d 681, 685 (Utah App.),
  
   cert. denied,
  
  843
   
   *1297
   
  P.2d 1042 (Utah 1992). In affirming defendant’s conviction in a cheek kiting scheme, the
  
   LeFevre
  
  court noted that to be guilty of deception under section 76-6-405: (1) defendant’s acts must satisfy the statutory definition of deception; (2) the deception must have occurred contemporaneously with the transaction in question; and (3) the victim must have relied on the deception, to some extent, in parting with the property.
  
   Id.
  


  In the present ease, we conclude that the State presented sufficient evidence to create a prima facie case that defendant’s acts met the three components of deception. For purposes of the first component — the statutory definition — Utah Code Ann. § 76-6-401(5) (1990) defines deception as occurring when someone intentionally:
 

  (a) Creates or confirms by words or conduct an impression of law or fact that is false and that the actor does not believe to be true and that is likely to affect the judgment of another in the transaction; or
 

  (b) Fails to correct a false impression of law or fact that the actor previously created or confirmed by words or conduct that is likely to affect the judgment of another and that the actor does not now believe to be true; or
 

  [[Image here]]
 

  (d) Sells or otherwise transfers or encumbers property without disclosing a lien, security interest, adverse claim, or other legal impediment to the enjoyment of the property, whether the lien, security interest, claim, or impediment is or is not valid or is or is not a matter of official record.
 


   Id.
  


  Defendant admitted that the ring he sold did not belong to him. However, the State presented testimony that defendant told the jeweler the ring contained a diamond and belonged to his wife. Because the State presented evidence that the ring did not belong to defendant, and that defendant may have lied as to how he obtained the ring and his authority to sell the ring, there was sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to con-elude that defendant intentionally “ereate[d] ... an impression of ... fact that is false and that the actor does not believe to be true and that is likely to affect the judgment of another in the transaction.”
  
   Id.
  
  A- finding of deception was further bolstered by evidence that defendant cashed the check the same day, despite agreeing to wait, and that defendant initially lied about the location of the money he had received in exchange for the ring. Further, defendant’s intent to deceive may be inferred from his fleeing with the cash and merchandise after being informed of the ring’s true value.
 

  As for the other components of deception, the conversation involving the ring occurred during defendant’s first visit to the store. Thus, the deception occurred contemporaneously with the transaction in question. Finally, Davis testified at trial that, when purchasing the ring, she relied in part on defendant’s assertions.
 

  While the evidence presented by the State may be weak, the jury is entitled to weigh the conflicting evidence and draw its own conclusion.
  
   State v. Pierce,
  
  722 P.2d 780, 781-82 (Utah 1986). Therefore, when viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the jury’s verdict, it appears that “some evidence exists from which a reasonable jury could find that the elements of the crime had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.”
  
   Dibello,
  
  780 P.2d at 1225. As a result, the trial court did not err in refusing to grant defendant’s motion to dismiss the theft by deception charge.

  Prosecutorial Misconduct
 

  Defendant asserts that the prosecutor’s conduct during the trial was improper and called the jury’s attention to matters which they should not have considered in reaching a verdict. First, defendant claims the prosecutor did not offer evidence to support his negative allusions made during cross-examination of defendant. During cross-examination, the prosecution referred to pawn shop records showing that defen
   
   *1298
   
  dant, soon after the incident, pawned the merchandise in Washington. The prosecution, however, did not introduce the pawn records into evidence. Defendant also alleges that questions regarding the disposition of the merchandise exceeded the scope of direct examination and were thus improper. Finally, defendant asserts that the prosecution improperly asked defendant to comment on the veracity of another witness.
 

  At trial, defendant did not object to the alleged instances of prosecutorial misconduct. Failure to object to improper questions “waives the claim unless the remarks reach the level of plain error.”
  
   State v. Palmer,
  
  860 P.2d 339, 342 (Utah App.),
  
   cert. denied,
  
  868 P.2d 95 (Utah 1993). Plain error exists when the error “should have been obvious to the trial court, and it was harmful.”
  
   Id.
  
  An error is harmful if it undermines the court’s confidence in the verdict.
  
   Id.
  


  In
  
   Palmer,
  
  defendant appealed his conviction of aggravated sexual abuse of a child. During cross-examination, the prosecution asked defendant whether he made incriminating statements to the victim’s stepfather. Defendant denied making these statements, and the prosecution did not introduce evidence to support its claims. The
  
   Palmer
  
  court noted, “ ‘[generally, Ã¢ÂÂ is error to ask an accused a question that implies the existence of a prejudicial fact unless the prosecution can prove the existence of the fact.’ ”
  
   Id.
  
  at 343 (quoting
  
   State v. Emmett,
  
  839 P.2d 781, 786-87 (Utah 1992)).
 

  The present case, however, is easily distinguishable from
  
   Palmer.
  
  Here, defendant admitted during cross-examination that he pawned the merchandise in Washington. Since defendant admitted pawning the merchandise, the prosecution did not need to produce the pawn records to establish the fact. The
  
   Palmer
  
  ruling precludes the State from implying prejudicial facts which it cannot substantiate. It does not require the State to substantiate facts that are verified by the defendant. Therefore, failing to introduce the pawn records into evidence was not prosecutorial misconduct.
 

  Defendant next asserts that cross-examination regarding the disposition of the merchandise exceeded the scope of direct examination, and thus was improper because it affected defendant’s credibility and character. However, Rule 611(b) of the Utah Rules of Evidence specifically allows for questioning during cross-examination pertaining to the witness’s credibility. Rule 611(b) reads in part as follows: “Cross-examination should be limited to the subject matter of the direct examination and matters affecting the credibility of the witness.” Utah R.Evid. 611(b). Therefore, cross-examination questions regarding the subsequent sale of the merchandise related to defendant’s credibility and were not improper.
 

  Finally, defendant argues that during cross-examination defendant was asked to comment on the veracity of another witness. Defendant alleges this drew the jury’s attention to improper information and is thus reversible error. Defendant is correct in stating that it is inappropriate for the prosecution “to ask a criminal defendant to comment on the veracity of another witness.”
  
   State v. Emmett,
  
  839 P.2d 781, 787 (Utah 1992). Moreover, the
  
   Emmett
  
  court noted that “[t]he prejudicial effect of such a question lies in the fact that it suggests to the jury that a witness is committing perjury even though there are other explanations for the inconsistency.”
  
   Id.
  


  In the ease at hand, the objectionable line of questioning was as follows:
 

  Q: So it’s your testimony that you never told anybody on that occasion that the way you came into possession of this ring was that it came from your wife, your ex-wife; is that correct? That’s what I’m hearing you say now.
 

  A: I never said it came from my wife.
 

  Q: Did you ever say it came from your ex-wife?
 

  A: No.
 

  Q: You heard the testimony, and you disagree with that testimony; is that correct?
 

  A: Yes.
 

  Any inference from the prosecutor’s questions that a previous witness lied is slight.
   
   *1299
   
  The questioning really served only to clarify defendant’s testimony in relation to prior testimony of another witness. It did not “seek information beyond the witness’s competence,” and did not “suggest[ ] to the jury that a witness is committing perjury.”
  
   Id.
  
  Moreover, we believe the questioning was not so obviously error that the trial court should have recognized it as such. Nor does the questioning undermine our confidence in the jury’s verdict.
  
   See Palmer,
  
  860 P.2d at 342. We therefore conclude that plain error did not occur and do not further address this issue.
 

  CONCLUSION
 

  At trial, the State succeeded in establishing a prima facie case of theft by deception. Therefore, the trial court properly denied defendant’s motion to dismiss that charge. Since a prima facie ease was established, there was no prejudice in not promptly ruling on the motion to dismiss.
 

  Defendant admitted he pawned the merchandise in Washington. As a result, the prosecution was not required to introduce evidence to establish that the merchandise was pawned. The prosecution’s questions regarding the disposition of the merchandise did not exceed the scope of cross-examination, since they related to defendant’s credibility. Finally, the prosecution’s questioning regarding the testimony of another witness was not plain error.
 

  We therefore affirm the conviction.

  STARR, Circuit Judge:
 

  This is a Social Security disability case. The claimant, Rose E. Brown, appeals from a judgment dismissing her action for review of a decision by the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services denying her claim for both disability and supplemental security income benefits under the Social Security Act. After careful review, we conclude that the Secretary’s decision was unsupported by substantial evidence.
 

  I
 

  For twenty-six years, Mrs. Brown was continuously employed and served successively as a waitress, delicatessen worker, butcher, and cook. Now fifty-nine years of age, Mrs. Brown is considered under applicable regulations to be of “advanced age,” 20 C.F.R. § 404.1563(d); her eleventh-grade education is classified as “limited.”
  
   Id.
  
  § 404.1564(b)(3). In November 1980, while performing her duties as a cook at a local church, Mrs. Brown sustained a back injury. Unable to work, she sought treatment. She was hospitalized twice. At the time, her treating physicians diagnosed her injury as a lumbosacral strain. Over the next eighteen months, several x-rays and a spinal CAT scan were interpreted as revealing lumbar lordosis, scoliosis, possible disc herniation, disc space narrowing, and spinal stenosis. These findings were interpreted as indicating degenerative disc disease. In April 1982, her former physician, Dr. Fleming, reported to a workers compensation insurer that Mrs. Brown would be “left with a partial permanent disability,” J.A. at 103, adding that she could “return to work now on a part-time basis to see if she [can] tolerate employment.”
  
   Id.
  


  In June 1982, the insurer engaged a consulting physician, Dr. Dorin, to examine Mrs. Brown. Dr. Dorin found that x-rays revealed disc space narrowing and sclerosis, which “could represent a discogenic disease or a low-grade infection.” J.A. at 107. The consulting physician concluded, however, that Mrs. Brown was not permanently disabled as a result of the injury and should have been able to return to her duties as a cook.
  
   Id.
  
  In early 1983, Mrs. Brown’s new treating physician, Dr. Jacques, increased the dosage of her prescribed painkiller. J.A. at 110. Following a neck injury suffered by Mrs. Brown in June 1983, further x-rays of the cervical region were interpreted as indicating scoliosis and degenerative arthritis. In October 1983, Dr. Jacques rendered a diagnosis of chronic low back pain, lumbosacral disc disease, spinal stenosis, scoliosis, and degenerative arthritis in the cervical region. J.A. at 196. His prognosis was that he did “not expect [a] complete cure. The disc disease itself is slowly progressive.” J.A. at 197. While not recommending surgery, Dr. Jacques added that he expected “no significant improvement in the underlying
   
   *705
   
  disease.”
  
   Id.
  
  Importantly, Dr. Jacques recommended “no heavy lifting or strenuous physical activity.”
  
   Id.
  
  at 196. He indicated that Mrs. Brown was unable to resume her duties as a cook due to the “heavy lifting and reaching” required, but that she could resume “non[-]physically strenuous duties.”
  
   Id.
  
  at 197.
  
   1
  


  Thus, over the three-year period since her first injury, Mrs. Brown had been diagnosed by several physicians as having chronic low back pain, lumbosacral disc disease, spinal stenosis, scoliosis, degenerative arthritis, neck pain, and hypertension. As of the time of this proceeding, she continued to receive biweekly outpatient treatment and was receiving various medications for back pain and hypertension.
 

  In August 1982, Mrs. Brown applied for disability insurance benefits
  
   2
  
  under Title II and Supplemental Security Income benefits
  
   3
  
  under Title XVI of the Social Security Act. Her applications were denied the following month, and her request for reconsideration was denied in March 1983. Mrs. Brown requested
  
   de novo
  
  consideration of her claims before an administrative law judge. After a hearing in November 1983, the AU entered his written decision denying her claims for benefits. The AU found that Mrs. Brown was not “disabled” within the meaning of the Act because her impairments would not prevent her from performing her “past relevant work.” This determination became the Secretary’s final decision in June 1984 when the Appeals Council denied the request for formal review. In May 1985, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, after consideration of cross-motions for judgment, affirmed the Secretary’s decision without opinion. The appeal before us is but another step on the long road of disability determination.
 

  II
 

  Like that of the District Court, our review is statutorily confined to determining whether the Secretary’s decision that Mrs. Brown was not disabled is supported by substantial evidence in the record. If substantial evidence exists, then the Secretary’s factfinding is conclusive. 42 U.S.C. § 405(g) (1985). In the classic formulation, substantial evidence is “such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.”

  305 U.S. 197, 229, 59 S.Ct. 206, 217, 83 L.Ed. 126 (1938)). Our review in substantial-evidence cases calls for careful scrutiny of the entire record.
  
   Dorsey v. Heckler,
  
  702 F.2d 597, 602 (5th Cir.1983).
 

  The pivotal statutory term, “disability,” is defined in pertinent part by the Act as the
 

  inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.
 

  42 U.S.C. § 423(d)(1)(A) (1982). The Secretary has established a sequential five-step process for evaluating a claimant’s alleged disability. 20 C.F.R. § 404.1520 (1983). A claimant may be found to be “not disabled” at any of the five stages of this review. First, an individual who is engaged in substantial gainful work is deemed to be not disabled, despite any medical evidence or other contraindications.
  
   Id.
  
  §§ 404.1520(b), 416.920(b). Second, an individual must have a severe “impairment” to be considered disabled.
  
   Id.
  
  §§ 404.1520(b), 416.-920(c). Third, if an “impairment” suffered by an individual is one of the requisite duration and is listed in the Secretary’s regulations, then the individual is considered disabled.
  
   Id.
  
  §§ 404.1520(d), 416.-
   
   *706
   
  920(d). Fourth, an individual who, though suffering from an “impairment,” is capable of performing work that he or she has done in the past is deemed not to be disabled.
  
   Id,
  
  §§ 404.1520(e), 416.920(e).
 

  During these first four steps, the claimant bears the burden of proof. At the fifth and final stage, the burden shifts to the Secretary to show that the individual, based upon his or her age, education, work experience, and residual functional capacity, is capable of performing gainful work.
  
   Id.
  
  §§ 404.1520(f), 416.920(f).

  In her appeal, Mrs. Brown presses two contentions:
  
   first,
  
  that the AU applied an improper standard of proof as to her claims of subjective pain in that he unduly emphasized the lack of objective medical evidence of pain; and,
  
   second,
  
  that his finding in the fourth step of the analysis as to her functional capacity to perform her past work was unsupported by substantial evidence.
 

  With regard to the first contention, the standard for evaluating claims of subjective pain is clear.
  
   4
  
  The governing statute provides that:
 

  there must be medical signs and findings, established by medically acceptable clinical or laboratory diagnostic techniques, which show the existence of a medical impairment ... which could reasonably be expected to produce the pain ... alleged.
 

  42 U.S.C. § 423(d)(5)(A) (Supp. II 1984)
  
   5
  
  ;
  
   see
  
  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1529, 416.929. Here, the AU expressly found that Mrs. Brown was afflicted with an underlying impairment, which he described as “severe.” AU Decision at 4 (Feb. 1, 1984). The statute also provides that, in evaluating the credibility of Mrs. Brown’s claim of subjective pain, it is well within the AU’s province to consider whatever medical evidence of pain or other symptoms exists, as well as Mrs. Brown’s statements and those of her physicians “as to the intensity and persistence of such pain or other symptoms which may reasonably be accepted as consistent with the medical signs and findings [as to an underlying impairment].” 42 U.S.C. § 423(d)(5)(A).
 

  In the case at hand, we are persuaded that the AU applied the proper legal standard. The record indicates that the AU did not conclude that a shortfall of objective evidence barred consideration of Mrs. Brown’s subjective allegation of pain. Rather, in weighing the relevant indicia— the underlying impairment, the medical evidence of pain, Mrs. Brown’s own statements, and the physician’s reports — the AU came to the independent judgment that her subjective claims of intractable pain were not credible. AU Decision at 5. We cannot conclude, as appellant would have us do, that the AU either placed undue emphasis on a lack of objective medical proof of pain oÃÂ­ simply ignored Mrs. Brown’s testimony. While contradictory evidence may exist, such credibility determinations are for the factfinder who hears the testimony; on this record, we find no reason to disturb the AU’s conclusion in this respect.
 

  IV
 

  The AU concluded that Mrs. Brown, although afflicted with a severe impairment which caused her some pain, could nevertheless engage in some of her past occupa
   
   *707
   
  tions. As a matter of law, and not surprisingly, the mere fact that working may cause a claimant pain or discomfort does not mandate a finding of disability.
  
   Epps v. Harris,
  
  624 F.2d 1267, 1274 (5th Cir.1980). Thus, the AU’s determination that Mrs. Brown was able to perform her past work despite some pain must be upheld if supported by substantial evidence. Viewing the record before us, however, we conclude that the AU’s determination in this respect was not undergirded by the requisite evidence.
 

  In reaching this conclusion, we pause first to observe the requirements imposed upon the AU in making these determinations. In evaluating a claimant’s ability to perform “past relevant” work, the AU is obliged by the regulations to review the claimant’s “residual functional capacity and the physical and mental demands of the work [the claimant has] done in the past.” 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1520(e), 416.920(e). This task requires a determination of the claimant’s “residual functional capacity for work activity on a regular and continuing basis,” which includes consideration of the claimant’s “ability to do physical activities such as walking, standing, lifting, carrying, pushing, pulling, reaching, handling and the evaluation of other physical functions.” 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1545(b), 416.945(b). This assessment is not in itself a determination of disability, but is rather a starting point for examining the claimant’s vocational background in light of her residual functional capacity.
  
   Id.
  
  §§ 404.1545(a), 416.945(a). The AU is required to consider the cumulative effects of all the claimant’s ailments and, if relevant, medications. Narrol
  
   v. Heckler,
  
  727 F.2d 1303, 1307 (D.C.Cir.1984);
  
   Diabo v. Secretary of Health, Education, & Welfare,
  
  627 F.2d 278, 282 (D.C.Cir.1980).
 

  Next, the AU must examine “the physical and mental demands” of the claimant’s past relevant work, 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.-1520(e), 416.920(e), which is the claimant’s substantial gainful work experience for the prior fifteen years.
  
   Id.
  
  §§ 404.1565(a), 416.965(a). This assessment must include an examination of pertinent work activities, including the nature and exertional requirements of tasks performed, such as the amount of walking, standing, sitting, lifting, and carrying.
  
   Narrol,
  
  727 F.2d at 1307; 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1545(a), 404.1565, 416.945(a), 416.965;
  
   see Cotter v. Harris,
  
  642 F.2d 700, 707 (3d Cir.1981). Ultimately, the AU must measure the requirements of the past work against the present capabilities of the claimant.
  
   Diabo,
  
  627 F.2d at 283.
 

  In this case, the relevant past employment during the prescribed period was Mrs. Brown’s work as a cook, butcher, and delicatessen worker. The AU credited the testimony of both the treating physician and the consulting physician as indicating that Mrs. Brown “should not engage in any work requiring strenuous activity or heavy lifting.” AU Decision at 4. The AU also observed that the treating physician had ruled out the possibility that Mrs. Brown could return to her position as a cook because of the heavy lifting and reaching involved in that occupation.
  
   Id.
  
  Curiously, the AU then found that Mrs. Brown’s only apparent “major limitation” was the avoidance of heavy lifting.
  
   Id.
  
  at 5. In so finding, he failed even to discuss the highly relevant and apparently uncontroverted evidence from both physicians which supported her claim that
  
   strenuous activity
  
  —not just heavy lifting — was also out of the question. The AU likewise failed to address the treating physician’s statement that Mrs. Brown could not perform cook work because of the
  
   reaching
  
  involved.
  
   6
  
 
   *708
   
  In addition, Mrs. Brown testified with regard to her functional abilities that she was advised not to lift or bend, Tr. at 9; she further stated that she could lift only eight pounds, Tr. at 17, could not bend,
  
   id.
  
  at 16, and could not stand or sit for more than fifteen or twenty minutes at a time. AU Decision at 3, Tr. at 16, 17-18. The AU’s implicit rejection, without even a breath of explanation, of the very evidence on which he relied for his earlier conclusions violated the elementary requirement that AU’s not only state their findings but explicate the reasons for their decision.
  
   See
  
  5 U.S.C. § 557(c); 20 C.F.R. § 404.953(a). The judiciary can scarcely perform its assigned review function, limited though it is, without some indication not only of what evidence was credited, but also whether other evidence was rejected rather than simply ignored.
  
   Cotter v. Harris, supra,
  
  642 F.2d at 705. What is more, in determining Mrs. Brown’s residual functional capacity, the AU offered no findings whatever as to what she
  
   could
  
  do; the extent of her ability to walk, stand, bend or reach is nowhere discussed, although such a determination is expressly required.
  
   See
  
  20 C.F.R. § 404.-1545(b).
  
   7
  


  The AU cited only Mrs. Brown’s testimony in describing her former employment. He stated that the cook position required her to be “on her feet” all day and to lift ten- to fifteen-pound objects, AU Decision at 3, whereas both the butcher and delicatessen positions required standing all day but no heavy lifting.
  
   Id.
  
  Although the AU expressed some doubt as to whether the lifting restriction indeed prevented Mrs. Brown from working as a cook, AU Decision at 4, he appears to have accepted this conclusion for purposes of his decision. Based upon Mrs. Brown’s testimony, the AU found that her former work as a butcher and delicatessen worker involved no “heavy lifting,”
  
   id.
  
  at 5, and concluded that her residual capacity permitted her to perform those jobs.
  
   Id.
  


  In so concluding, the AU made no findings as to the “physical and mental demands” of this past work. To compound this shortcoming, the AU failed completely to explore Mrs. Brown’s capacity
  
   vel non
  
  to perform those functions. As if more were needed, his conclusion appears to ignore the record evidence as to the nature of the tasks performed in the butcher and delicatessen jobs. We turn briefly to that evidence.
 

  The vocational report indicated that Mrs. Brown’s job as a cook involved lifting up to twenty pounds, walking six hours a day, standing three hours a day, occasional bending and constant reaching. J.A. at 90. The report stated that the butcher job required lifting ten to fifteen pounds, eight hours of walking and four hours of standing each day, and occasional bending and reaching. J.A. at 91. The delicatessen position, as described in the report, involved no heavy lifting, but entailed eight hours of walking and six hours of standing each
   
   *709
   
  day, with constant bending and reaching. J.A. at 92.
 

  Nothing in the AU’s decision indicates whether he considered this evidence or, if he did, why he rejected it. On this record, we are persuaded that the AU’s determination — albeit grudging in nature — that Mrs. Brown could not perform her cook duties because of the necessary heavy lifting is at war with his conclusion that she could work as a butcher. The AU cited Mrs. Brown’s testimony that she lifted ten to fifteen pounds as a cook. When her treating physician restricted her work activities to those involving no heavy lifting, the physician was expressly referring to the lifting she did as a cook. Although Mrs. Brown testified that her butcher work involved “no heavy lifting,” her vocational report states that that job entailed frequent lifting of ten- to fifteen-pound objects. Thus, the AU inexplicably found her incapable of working as a cook on account of the ten- to fifteen-pound lifting requirement in that capacity, yet capable of meeting the identical lifting requirement as a butcher.
 

  Even more important, the AU’s decision acknowledged the uncontradicted evidence that Mrs. Brown could not engage in strenuous activities or reaching. The AU, however, made no findings as to the extent of the physical demands (other than lifting) imposed by the butcher and delicatessen jobs. Both jobs, according to record evidence, required Mrs. Brown to be on her feet constantly. Her delicatessen work also required constant bending and reaching, far more than that demanded by her work as a cook. The AU merely asserted in conclusory fashion that Mrs. Brown could satisfy all exertional requirements of these former jobs; absent any discussion of what those requirements were, and given the flatly contrary evidence in the record as to the nature of those requirements, such an
  
   ex cathedra
  
  pronouncement cannot fairly be said to enjoy the requisite support in the record.
 

  We recognize that the AU had before him conflicting evaluations of Mrs. Brown’s limitations. Dr. Dorin, at one extreme, had concluded that Mrs. Brown had no permanent limitations and could return to work as a cook. Dr. Jacques’ evaluation, rendered a year later, was that Mrs. Brown could no longer work as a cook and should avoid heavy lifting and strenuous physical activity. The AU is certainly entitled to weigh conflicting opinions and to make his own assessment of their credibility. We merely hold here that that determination must be made within and according to the governing regulations.
 

  IV
 

  The absence of findings on the crucial issues of the requirements entailed in Mrs. Brown’s prior employment and her ability to engage in the full range of activities demanded by those jobs gravely undermines the AU’s decision, depriving it of the necessary substantial record support. We are left with no choice but to remand this case to the District Court with instructions to remand the case in turn to the Secretary for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. In so doing, we obviously intimate no view whatever as to whether Mrs. Brown is indeed “disabled” within the meaning of the Social Security Act. That determination must, alas, await the conclusion of this labyrinthine process which may seem to Mrs. Brown to have no end. We trust that the District Court and ultimately the Secretary will not leave the case to languish by the wayside of this tortuous path.
 


   It is so ordered.

   . ""Subjective pain"" is simply a claimant’s allegations of pain. Under the regulations, pain is a ""symptom"", 20 C.F.R. § 404.1529, which is, in turn, defined as a claimant’s own description of his or her impairment,
   
    id.

   . The Secretary suggests that the lack of such discussion by the AU should give us no pause because ""[t]here is ... no explanation with regard to [the treating physician’s] opinion on appellant’s limitation in reaching.” Brief at 21. This is scarcely a response to this clear omission, for the AU had a duty to probe all relevant evidence and to develop a proper record.

    see Narrol,
   
   727 F.2d at

   1307. Instead, he appears to have ignored altogether evidence of necessary restrictions upon Mrs. Brown’s activities, save for heavy lifting.
  


   7
  

   . The Secretary has contended that Mrs. Brown's residual functional capacity was consistent with the physical exertion requirements of “light work.""
   
    See 20
   
   C.F.R. § 404.1567(b). Since the butcher and delicatessen positions are classified as ""light work,” the Secretary concludes that Mrs. Brown may be deemed capable of performing them. Inasmuch as this analysis is nowhere to be found in the Secretary’s decision, this
   
    post-hoc
   
   argument is precluded by the teaching of
   
    SEC v. Chenery Corp.,
   
   318 U.S. 80, 87, 63 S.Ct. 454, 459, 87 L.Ed. 626 (1943). Quite aside from
   
    Chenery's
   
   bar, this analysis begs the question whether Mrs. Brown is indeed capable of “light work.” As defined by the Secretary’s regulations, “light work” involves lifting up to twenty pounds and frequent carrying of up to ten pounds,
   
    id.
   
   § 505.1567(b), yet this is precisely what Drs. Dorin and Jaques reported that Mrs. Brown was not to do, AU Decision at 4. “Light work” also requires a “good deal of’ walking or standing, or sitting most of the time with some arm and leg motion.
   
    Id.
   
   To be considered capable of light work, a claimant must be able to do ""substantially all” of these activities.
   
    Id.
   
   Absent any findings as to Mrs. Brown’s capacity to engage in these activities, it cannot so readily be concluded that she was indeed able to perform “light work.” The lifting prohibition alone would appear at this stage of record development to remove her from that category altogether.

ISHEE, J.,
for the Court:
¶ 1. On June 24, 2004, thirteen-year-old Brandon Wilson (Brandon) was injured in a swimming pool at a Hampton Inn Hotel (the Hotel) located in New Orleans, Louisiana. The Hotel was managed by defendant, Highpointe Hospitality (Highpointe), the president of which was Darryl La-Pointe (LaPointe). Highpointe is a Florida corporation authorized to do business in Louisiana, and LaPointe is a Florida resident. In October 2007, Brandon’s father, Barney Wilson (Wilson), filed suit on Brandon’s behalf in the Circuit Court of Warren County, Mississippi, naming High-pointe and LaPointe, among others, as defendants. Thereafter, Highpointe and La-Pointe filed a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. The circuit court granted the motion, and in December 2009, a final judgment was entered dismissing the case. Aggrieved, Wilson now appeals. Finding no error, we affirm.
FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY
¶ 2. In 2004, Brandon attended a church field trip to New Orleans, Louisiana, where he stayed at the Hotel. The Hotel was managed by Highpointe, a company that was incorporated in Florida and had its principal place of business in Florida. Highpointe was not licensed to do business in Mississippi. The president of High-pointe was LaPointe, who is a Florida resident. Neither defendant engaged in advertising or marketing for the Hotel. However, national, general advertising of the Hampton Inn Hotel franchise was conducted by the Hotel’s parent corporation, Hilton Hotel Corporation, mainly through the Internet.
¶ 3. On June 24, 2004, while staying at the Hotel on a church field trip, Brandon dove into the Hotel’s swimming pool and was injured. Brandon’s father, Wilson, sued on Brandon’s behalf in circuit court, alleging negligence and deceptive advertising. In addition to naming Highpointe and LaPointe in the suit, Wilson also named Crescent City Lodging, Inc., Hilton Hotel Corporation, and Charles Harris as defendants. Crescent City Lodging, Inc. is no longer in business due to extensive damage by Hurricane Katrina. Hilton Hotels Corporation settled with Wilson. Harris never made an appearance in the case, and the record does not reflect whether Wilson ever sought further relief from him.
¶ 4. On August 28, 2008, Highpointe and LaPointe filed a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. The motion was granted in November 2008, and a final *1001judgment was entered in December 2009 dismissing all of Wilson’s claims. Wilson now appeals the circuit court’s ruling on the motion to dismiss. Finding no error, we affirm.
DISCUSSION
¶ 5. The standard of review is de novo for analyzing a trial court’s grant or denial of a motion to dismiss. Smith v. City of Saltillo, 44 So.Sd 438, 439 (¶ 5) (Miss.Ct.App.2010) (citing Spencer v. State, 880 So.2d 1044, 1045 (¶ 6) (Miss.2004)). The following two-prong test exists to determine if a Mississippi court may exercise jurisdiction over a non-resident defendant: (1) whether a defendant is amenable to suit in Mississippi by virtue of the state’s long-arm statute, Mississippi Code Annotated section 13-3-57 (Rev. 2002); and, if so, (2) whether a defendant is “amenable to suit ... consistent with due process.” McDaniel v. Ritter, 556 So.2d 303, 308 n. 4 (Miss.1989) (citation omitted).
¶ 6. Mississippi’s long-arm statute provides, in pertinent part, the following:
Any nonresident person, firm, general or limited partnership, or any foreign or other corporation not qualified under the Constitution and laws of this state as to doing business herein, who shall make a contract with a resident of this state to be performed in whole or in part by any party in this state, or who shall commit a tort in whole or in part in this state against a resident or nonresident of this state, or who shall do any business or perform any character of work or service in this state, shall by such act or acts be deemed to be doing business in Mississippi and shall thereby be subjected to the jurisdiction of the courts of this state.
Miss.Code Ann. § 13-3-57. As such, in order for a Mississippi court to establish personal jurisdiction over a defendant, the plaintiff must show that the defendant falls within the “contract,” “tort,” or the “doing business” prong of the long-arm statute. Id. To be considered as “doing business,” the defendant must meet the following requirements: “(1) the nonresident corporation must purposefully do some act or consummate a transaction in Mississippi; (2) the cause of action must either arise from or be connected with the act or transaction; and (3) the assumption of jurisdiction by Mississippi must not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.” Williams v. Bud Wilson’s Mobile Home Serv., 887 So.2d 830, 832 (¶ 9) (Miss.Ct.App.2004) (citing Gross v. Chevrolet Country, Inc., 655 So.2d 873, 877 (Miss.1995)).
¶ 7. In this case, Highpointe and La-Pointe did not enter into a contract with a Mississippi resident to be performed in any way, shape, or form in Mississippi. Nor did Highpointe and LaPointe commit a tort in Mississippi. Any injury or damages to Wilson would have occurred in Louisiana.
¶8. Regardless, Wilson claims personal jurisdiction attaches in that Highpointe and LaPointe were “doing business” in Mississippi due to the advertising which was conducted by Hilton Hotels Corporation on behalf of its franchise, Hampton Inn Hotels. However, Wilson’s argument fails the “ ‘doing business’ in Mississippi” test discussed above.
¶ 9. The record reflects that Highpointe and LaPointe did not purposefully do any act or consummate any transaction in Mississippi. While Wilson asserts that the advertising in question constitutes “doing business” in Mississippi, neither High-pointe nor LaPointe were involved in the advertising. The advertising was planned *1002and executed solely by Hilton Hotels Corporation as part of a national, generalized advertising plan.
¶ 10. The record further reflects that neither Highpointe nor LaPointe do business in Mississippi; neither have any connection to Mississippi; and they have not received any benefits or protections from Mississippi. Additionally, the church sponsoring the field trip during which Brandon was injured, initiated the phone call to the Hotel in order to solicit information from the Hotel. Accordingly, it is clear that neither Highpointe nor LaPointe has purposefully availed itself to the State of Mississippi.
¶ 11. Finally, even assuming arguendo that Highpointe and LaPointe were to fall within Mississippi’s long-arm statute, an exercise of personal jurisdiction over either Highpointe or LaPointe would be inconsistent with due process. Since High-pointe and LaPointe clearly do not have sufficient minimum contacts with Mississippi, an attempt to exercise jurisdiction would fail to satisfy the due-process notions of “fair play and substantial justice.” Int'l Shoe Co. v. State of Washington, 326 U.S. 310, 316, 66 S.Ct. 154, 90 L.Ed. 95 (1945).
¶ 12. As stated by the United States Supreme Court, a trial court must be satisfied by the plaintiffs showing that the defendant did “some act by which the defendant purposefully avails itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum state.” Hanson v. Denckla, 357 U.S. 235, 253, 78 S.Ct. 1228, 2 L.Ed.2d 1283 (1958). Additionally, the defendant’s “conduct and connection with the forum State [must be] such that he should reasonably anticipate being haled into court there.” World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U.S. 286, 297, 100 S.Ct. 559, 62 L.Ed.2d 490 (1980).
¶ 13. Here, neither Highpointe nor La-Pointe had any contacts with Mississippi whatsoever, and neither had reason to anticipate being a party to litigation here. Accordingly, because we find that no personal jurisdiction exists over Highpointe and LaPointe, we affirm the ruling of the Warren County Circuit Court granting the motion to dismiss Wilson’s ease.
¶ 14. THE JUDGMENT OF THE WARREN COUNTY CIRCUIT COURT IS AFFIRMED. ALL COSTS OF THIS APPEAL ARE ASSESSED TO THE APPELLANT.

273918,273918,527518,"Anna Knoll and Rose Keller v. Socony Mobil Oil Company, Inc., a Corporation","Anna KNOLL and Rose Keller, Appellants, v. SOCONY MOBIL OIL COMPANY, Inc., a Corporation, Et Al., Appellees","

  WILLIAM E. DOYLE, District Judge.
 

  This is an appeal from a judgment in consolidated interpleader suits in which the trial court, in determining the right to deposited funds, made findings and conclusions with respect to the ownership of a one-half section of land situated in Graham County, Kansas, the oil and gas leases covering said land, and the proceeds for the sale of oil produced from said land which were on deposit with the clerk of the court. The appellants, Anna Knoll and Rose Keller, seek reversal contending that the lower court lacked federal interpleader jurisdiction; that it erred in its order of distribution of the oil sale proceeds and in proceeding with the trial after the appellants filed affidavits that the judge disqualify himself; that the court erred in failing to appoint counsel to represent appellant Rose Keller; and that the sum total of these actions was a deprivation of due process of law.
 

  Each of the consolidated actions was commenced by Mobil Oil Company pursuant to the interpleader provisions of Title 28 U.S.C. § 1335, as purchaser of oil produced from certain oil and gas leases on the Graham County, Kansas, lands. The complaints alleged that Mobil was the purchaser of crude oil produced from said lands and that the parties named as defendants (who, with the exception of appellants Anna Knoll and Rose Keller, appear on this appeal as ap-pellees along with Mobil) were in dispute over their respective ownership rights to the land and the leases thereunder; that because of these adverse and conflicting claims by the defendants Mobil could not with safety to itself pay or distribute monies due to them from the purchase of crude oil by Mobil. It prayed that the defendants be required to inter-plead and settle among themselves their respective rights to the monies due, and that they be restrained from instituting any further action against Mobile involving said monies. In conjunction with the filing of the complaints, Mobil deposited the monies due (which exceed $500.00) with the court.
 

  Appellants asserted a counterclaim against Mobil alleging that Mobil had been negligent in the previous distribution of royalties. The trial court dismissed this prior to trial on the basis that Mobil was a mere stakeholder and not
   
   *427
   

   an
  
  “opposing party” against appellants and hence a counterclaim filed pursuant to Rule 13, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, could not be supported.
 

  There was also a pretrial effort on the part of a defendant other than the present appellants to dismiss the interpleader for lack of jurisdiction. Surprisingly, this effort was opposed by the appellants who now question the trial court’s jurisdiction. The Court denied this motion holding that as a mere stakeholder the plaintiff’s interpleader actions were proper.
 

  The appellants failed to appear at either the pretrial conference or the trial itself. Indeed, they failed to appear at other hearings which involved matters which directly affected them. They did frequently file documents. As the result, however, of their having ignored the proceedings in the trial court, their problems are the more complex in the present review proceeding and we are limited to issues jurisdictional in character.
 

  All of the defendants, with the exception of Anna Knoll and Rose Keller, admitted all the allegations of the complaints. The appellants asserted a larger interest in said properties than was alleged in the complaints, denied the validity of the said oil leases, alleged that Mobil had been negligent in making payments to the defendants for oil purchases in amounts inconsistent with their respective interests in the properties, and further alleged fraud on the part of several of the defendants with respect to certain mesne conveyances of fee simple, mineral and royalty interests in the said properties.
 

  The trial was in a sense a default hearing although evidence was taken and statements of counsel were made into the record. From the evidence taken and the statements made it would appear that the conflict here is of long standing. In the early 1940’s the appellants conveyed to Adolph Knoll their interest in certain Kansas lands which later produced oil. Adolph transferred the entire interest to the brother of the appellants, Alex Knoll. In 1959 there was litigation in the United States District Court for the District of Kansas, involving the question whether the conveyance had been in trust. This litigation was finally culminated when an agreement was reached whereby the appellants and other members of the Knoll family were given small royalty interests. That agreement, however, did not settle the dispute and we find the appellants bringing an action in 1964 in the United States District Court for the District of Kansas against their brothers and sisters and Mdbil in which they asserted fraud in the settlement agreement and demanded an undivided one-ninth interest in the property. This case was dismissed for failure to join parties. Knoll v. Knoll, 10 Cir. 1965, 350 F.2d 407, cert. denied 383 U.S. 909, 86 S.Ct. 891, 15 L.Ed.2d 664, reh. denied 383 U.S. 973, 86 S.Ct. 1270, 16 L.Ed.2d 313.
 

  At the trial, the judge made rather extensive findings of fact and conclusions of law in which he recognized the prior settlement and decreed a distribution of the funds which had been deposited in the registry of the court.
  
   1
  
  The Court also
   
   *428
   
  permanently enjoined the appellants from ever asserting any title to the property inconsistent with the order and judgment.
 

  I.
 

  Appellants argue that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to entertain interpleader because, as they maintain, it does not appear that the named defendants had made adverse claims to the fund. A conclusive answer to this is that the present act (Title 28 U.S.C. § 1335) is not limited to adverse claimants who “are claiming,” but also includes two or more adverse claimants who “may claim” to be entitled. There must be a real risk of vexatious, conflicting claims
  
   2
  
  but certainly that is present here. In fact, the appellants were engaged in litigation and were asserting similar types of claims at the very time that the present suit was filed.
  
   3
  


  Appellants assert further that Mobil is not a disinterested stakeholder; that it was a named defendant in the 1964 suit and is “independently liable” to them as evidenced by their counterclaim alleging Mobil’s prior negligent distribution.
  
   4
  


  The fact that Mobil was defending litigation at the time the present action was brought does not preclude the court’s jurisdiction. Mobil had eschewed any interest in the fund and there is nothing in the record to suggest that Mobil’s interest in the fund deposited was or is anything more than a desire to obtain an adjudication as to rightful ownership of the fund. This is precisely the type of situation for which inter-pleader is designed. See Holcomb v. Aetna Life Insurance Co., 10 Cir. 1955, 228 F.2d 75.
 

  The further objection of appellants that Mobil is “independently liable” to them as shown by their counterclaim,
   
   *429
   
  is also without merit. The previous decisions of this Court preclude a holding that the existence of a prior independent liability defeats jurisdiction in an inter-pleader suit. Thus, in First National Bank in Dodge City v. Johnson County National Bank & Trust Co., 10 Cir. 1964, 331 F.2d 325, an effort to file a counterclaim was made by one in a position identical to that of the appellants. The holding was that Rule 13, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, precludes the filing of a counterclaim against one who asserts no primary claim against the “counter-claimant.”
 

  In a more recent decision, Erie Bank v. United States District Court for the District of Colorado, 10 Cir.1966, 362 F.2d 539, the Court went even further. It held that a court in an interpleader suit in which plaintiff asserts no claim to the deposited fund, lacks jurisdiction to proceed with the counterclaim and must dismiss it. In that case it was said:
 

  “The motion to dismiss the counterclaim, filed in the action below by the bank, goes to the jurisdiction of the court to further proceed as to the counterclaim. This court, in First National Bank in Dodge City v. The Johnson County National Bank and Trust Co., etc., et al., 10 Cir., 331 F.2d 325, held that in an interpleader suit, where the plaintiff asserts no claim to the inter-pleaded fund, a counterclaim cannot be asserted by one of the claimants to the fund against the plaintiff because they are not ‘opposing parties’ within the meaning of Rule 13, F.R.Civ.P. The facts presented here fall squarely within that decision and the bank’s motion to dismiss the counterclaim should have been granted.”
  
   5
  


  We read this as holding that in an interpleader suit wherein the plaintiff asserts no claim to the funds deposited, the Court lacks
  
   jurisdiction
  
  to hear a “counterclaim”. A necessary corollary of this holding is that the existence of alleged “independent liability” will not defeat interpleader jurisdiction. It follows that appellants’ contention that the trial court lacked interpleÃÂ¡der jurisdiction based on possible existence of independent liability is wholly without merit.
 

  II.
 

  A related jurisdictional issue is whether the trial court erred in enjoining appellants from asserting any title in or to the “above described property” in any manner inconsistent with the terms of its order and judgment. This was an
  
   in personam,
  
  exercise of jurisdiction. In an interpleader action, however,
  
   in personam
  
  jurisdiction extends only to the fund deposited with the court.
  
   6
  
  Since the trial court was limited to disposition of the
  
   res,
  
  we must hold that the court lacked jurisdiction to enter this order. The injunctive order was, therefore, void. In so holding we do not suggest that any claim which appellants may assert in the future has any merit. Indeed, the sad fact seems to be that appellants’ case is devoid of any substantial promise.
 

  III.
 

  On February 16, 1966, the appellant Rose Keller filed an affidavit seeking the disqualification of the trial judge. In it there are various general references to the judge’s previous rulings in other cases involving the appellants. Other than that it consists of a repetition of conclusions that the trial judge was biased against these two appellants. There are no facts other than the mentioned proceedings and rulings.
 

  On February 25, 1966, a hearing was held and the appellants did not even appear. A transcript of this proceeding shows that the trial judge was concerned about the affidavit of prejudice, but at the time no other judge was available in the district to consider it. The Court did not rule on
   
   *430
   
  the disqualification request at that time, but continued the matter in order to ascertain whether the appellants would appear. The Court stated that if they did appear he would attempt to obtain the services of another judge within the district. On the appointed day, that is, February 28, the appellants were not present and on, that occasion the court concluded that the affidavit was neither timely nor sufficient, and denied it.
 

  The statute provides that when a timely and sufficient affidavit is filed the judge shall proceed no further therein, but another judge shall be assigned to hear such proceeding.
  
   7
  
  There is also a requirement that the affidavit be filed not less than ten days before the term at which the proceeding is to be heard. This has been held to be a matter of substance and not merely one of form.
  
   8
  


  A basic assumption in activating the disqualification machinery is that the affidavit shall be sufficient. In order for the affidavit to be sufficient it must contain something more than conclusions. Facts showing the existence of personal bias and prejudice on the part of the judge are essential.
  
   9
  
  Thus, it is not sufficient to show that there exists a prejudice or bias based on the judge’s previously expressed view of the law.
  
   10
  
  The fact that a judge has decided a previous case against a litigant is also insufficient.
  
   11
  
  Moreover, the fact that the judge has made adverse rulings against the party during litigation is insufficient.
  
   12
  


  In denying appellants’ motion the trial court noted that it did not have terms of court, but concluded that a motion filed after the case was set for trial was not timely within the meaning of the statute. An order setting the case for trial had been entered on January 12, 1966; the trial date was February 28, 1966. The affidavit was not filed until February 16, 1966.
 

  We conclude that the court was correct in ruling that this request was untimely made. We must also conclude that the affidavit was insufficient — it lacked facts having the tendency to show personal bias and prejudice. The various references to previous rulings do not show personal prejudice or bias. The affidavit being replete with arguments and conclusions was palpably insufficient. The trial judge was as competent to conclude this as another judge would have been.
 

  IY.
 

  Finally, it is urged that the Court should have appointed counsel to represent appellants in view of their showing of inability to employ counsel notwithstanding efforts made in eleven different counties in Kansas as well as in other states. They refer to a statute, 28 U.S.C. § 1915(d) which relates to proceedings in forma pauperis, and provides that the court may
  
   request
  
  an attorney to represent any such person unable to employ counsel. By the terms of this section the Court is not required to assign counsel. The Court may request an attorney, but the appointment of counsel in a civil case is a privilege and not a right.
  
   13
  
  The position of appellants is that the Court is required to note the plight of the appellants and to proceed on
   
   *431
   
  his own motion to appoint counsel to represent them. We conclude that he was not under the circumstances here presented required to take such action.
 

  Appellants at last argue that there has been a deprivation of constitutional rights, especially in connection with the retention of appellants’ distributive share as a supersedeas bond. We discern no error in this action nor in any of the other acts of the trial court in relationship to these parties. On the contrary, every effort was made to extend to the appellants the opportunity to present their arguments and contentions and they chose to forego all of these opportunities. They were content to write letters and file documents, and then appeal.
 

  We have carefully examined the entire record herein and have been unable to discover any justifiable basis for reversal other than the one injunctive order.
 

  The judgment of the District Court is affirmed, with the exception of the order enjoining appellants from further litigation. It is ordered that this part of the judgment be vacated.
 


   1
  

   . In its journal entry of judgment dated March 25, 1966, the trial judge made findings of fact as follows: (1) That the Probate Court of Graham County, Kansas had, pursuant to a hearing in 1957, determined that each of the nine children of Rosa Knoll had inherited a %th interest in all property owned by her at her death, subject to any dispositions since that date; (2) That this property, being the property disputed by the defendants named in the interpleader suits filed by Mobil, was subsequently conveyed in fee by eight of the children, in-eluding Anna Knoll and Rose Keller, to their brother Adolph Knoll on August 4, 1942; (3) That in 1959, three of the children, Anna Knoll, Rose Keller, and Margaret Sluga, brought an action in the United States District Court for the District of Kansas (Civil Action No. W-1811) against Alex Knoll (who, the record shows, received the property by conveyance from Adolph Knoll and his wife in 1950), alleging that they were presently
   
    owners of
   
   a %th interest in the property; (4) That the court dismissed this action with prejudice on
    
    *428
    
   August 31, 1959, on the ground that the parties had reached a settlement agreement on July 29, 1959, whereby Alex Knoll conveyed to each of his brothers and sisters a %2cl of %th royalty interest in the oil and gas production from the land in return for a deed from the plaintiffs quitclaiming all their interest in the property; (5) That the settlement agreement was not obtained by fraud, as alleged by the appellants; (6) That the appellants could not repudiate this agreement as they purported to have done; (7) That the record title to the property was vested in Alex Knoll subject to a %2i °f %th royalty interest in the oil and gas production for each of the brothers and sisters, including appellants, and subject to other oil and gas leases of record; (8) That the oil and gas lease given by Alex Knoll to appellee Casey Jones in 1951 was valid, as were the subsequent mesne assignments of leasehold interests by Jones to appellees J. A. Terteling & Sons and J. A. Terteling and Sons, Inc.; (9) That there was no negligence on the part of Casey Jones or his assignees in obtaining the aforementioned leases; and (10) That the affidavit of appellant Rose Keller requesting the trial judge to disqualify himself was not timely filed and did not contain allegations sufficient in fact (or law) to establish his bias or prejudice against the appellants. Based upon these factual findings the trial court overruled appellant Rose Keller’s motion seeking disqualification of the trial judge, ordered the proceeds which had been deposited with the court to be distributed in accordance with the interests defined in the July 29, 1959 settlement agreement, and enjoined appellants from “asserting any title in or to the above described property in any manner inconsistent with the terms of this order and judgment.”

  ORDER AND JUDGMENT
  
   *
  


  PER CURIAM.
 

  Skoshi Thedford Farr appeals the district court’s denial of release on bail pending her appeal of her conviction for tax evasion in violation of 26 U.S.C. § 7201. Exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291 and 18 U.S.C. § 3145(c), we affirm.
 

  Under 18 U.S.C. § 3143(b)(1), detention pending appeal is presumed unless a judicial officer finds (A) “by clear and convincing evidence that the person is not likely to flee or pose a danger to the safety of any other person or the community,” and (B) “that the appeal is not for purpose of delay and raises a substantial question of law or fact likely to result in” reversal, a new trial, or a lesser sentence. The district court concluded that Ms. Farr had failed to show the required substantial question of law or fact. “Whether the particular circumstances of a case satisfy a prescribed statutory standard ... presents a mixed question of law and fact.”
  
   United States v. Kinslow,
  
  105 F.3d 555, 557 (10th Cir.1997) (per curiam). We “apply de novo review to mixed questions of law and fact concerning the detention or release decision, while accepting the district court’s findings of historical fact which support that decision, unless they are clearly erroneous.”
  
   Id.-, see also United States v. Stricklin,
  
  932 F.2d 1353, 1355 (10th Cir.1991) (per curiam).
 

  “[A] substantial question is one of more substance than would be necessary to a finding that it was not frivolous. It is a close question or one that very well could be decided the other way.”
  
   United States v. Affleck,
  
  765 F.2d 944, 952 (10th Cir.1985) (en banc) (internal quotation marks omitted). “[Wjhether a particular question is ‘substantial’ must be determined on a case-by-case basis[.]”
  
   Id.
  
  On appeal, Ms. Farr identifies four issues that she contends present substantial questions of law or fact: (1) double jeopardy; (2) admission of prejudicial Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b) evidence; (3) indictment under § 7201 instead of 26 U.S.C. § 7202; and (4) insufficiency of the evidence. None of these issues, however, appear to be close questions or questions that very well could be decided in favor of Ms. Farr.
 


   Double Jeopardy.
  
  Ms. Farr’s double jeopardy argument is based upon this court’s reversal of her first conviction under § 7201.
  
   See United States v. Farr,
  
  536 F.3d 1174, 1176 (10th Cir.2008)
  
   (“Farr I
  
  ”). But this court has already explicitly considered and rejected her double jeopardy argument.
  
   United States v. Farr,
  
  591 F.3d 1322, 1326 (10th Cir.),
  
   cert. denied,
  
  - U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 274, 178 L.Ed.2d 140 (2010);
  
   see also Farr I,
  
  536 F.3d at 1176, 1186 (leaving open the possibility that Ms. Farr could be retried under a new indictment). Thus, this issue does not present a substantial question in the current appeal.
 

  Rule 404(b)
  
   Evidence.
  
  The district court’s admission of Rule 404(b) evidence
   
   *759
   
  will be reviewed for abuse of discretion.
  
   United States v. Caldwell,
  
  560 F.3d 1214, 1220 (10th Cir.2009). Rule 404(b) allows the admission of evidence to prove elements such as “intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, ... or absence of mistake or accident.” As Ms. Farr acknowledges, to obtain a conviction, the government had to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that she acted willfully. The district court explicitly relied on this ground in admitting the evidence. Although Ms. Farr argues that the prejudicial impact of the evidence outweighed its probative value, on the limited record before this panel, we cannot conclude that there is a substantial question whether the district court abused its discretion in admitting the Rule 404(b) evidence.
 


   Proceeding under incorrect statute.
  
  Ms. Farr contends that she should have been charged under 26 U.S.C. § 7202 rather than 26 U.S.C. § 7201. It appears, however, that § 7201 encompasses her conduct.
  
   See Farr I,
  
  536 F.3d at 1186 (“[T]he government has adduced ample evidence from which a jury could find Ms. Farr guilty of evading the trust fund recovery penalty.”). “When a defendant’s conduct violates more than one criminal statute, the government may prosecute under either (or both, for that matter, subject to limitations on conviction and punishment).”
  
   United States v. Bradshaw,
  
  580 F.3d 1129, 1136 (10th Cir.2009). “Absent certain allegations of impropriety, it is not the role of the jury (or the judge) to decide whether the government has charged the correct crime, but only to decide if the government has proved the crime it charged.”
  
   Id.
  
  Accordingly, this issue does not present a substantial question for appeal.
 


   Insufficiency of evidence.
  
  Finally, Ms. Farr argues that there was insufficient evidence to convict her of tax evasion from November 12, 2001, to September 2002, when the IRS ceased communication with her. It is not clear why she focuses on 2001-2002, however, given that the indictment specified a time period from November 12, 2001, through at least August 15, 2006. In any event, based on this limited record, we cannot conclude that it is a close question whether the evidence was insufficient to sustain her conviction. This court noted in Ms. Farr’s first trial that “the government has adduced ample evidence from which a jury could find Ms. Farr guilty of evading the trust fund recovery penalty.”
  
   Farr I,
  
  536 F.3d at 1186;
  
   see also id.
  
  at 1187-88 & n. 11 (discussing the evidence).
 

  The district court’s denial of release on bail pending appeal is AFFIRMED.

  Opinion
 

  PUGLIA, P. J.
 

  Plaintiffs, individual insurance agents and brokers and their trade associations, appeal from a judgment denying the relief sought in a petition for writ of mandate and complaint for declaratory relief. This appeal concerns a provision of Proposition 103, an initiative measure adopted at the November 8, 1988, General Election. The trial court held the provision, which expressly repealed Insurance Code section 1643, impliedly repealed Financial Code sections 772, subdivision (b) and 1208 to the extent they prohibit state banks and their subsidiaries from licensure as, or from acting as, insurance agents or brokers. Accordingly, the trial court declined plaintiffs’ requests to direct the Commissioner of Insurance (Commissioner) to rescind insurance agency and brokerage licenses issued to state banks and to enjoin the licensing of state banks and their subsidiaries as insurance agents or brokers.
 

  On appeal, plaintiffs challenge the trial court’s determination of repeal by implication, noting such repeals are disfavored and arguing the criteria for finding an implied repeal are not met here. Plaintiffs contend (1) there is nothing within Proposition 103 or the ballot materials relating to it which gives undebatable evidence of an intent to supersede the Financial Code provisions at issue here and (2) Proposition 103 may be given effect without affecting those Financial Code provisions because they are not so inconsistent with Proposition 103 as to preclude concurrent operation.
 

 
   *606
   
  We agree with plaintiffs that application of the doctrine of repeal by implication, under the facts here presented, is unwarranted. Nonetheless, plaintiffs are not entitled to all of the relief they seek. The clear intent of the initiative was to allow state banks to sell insurance, and there is nothing within the provisions of Financial Code sections 772, subdivision (b) or 1208 which precludes that intent from being fully implemented. However, neither the initiative nor the accompanying ballot materials suggest the measure had any application to bank subsidiaries. Accordingly, since Financial Code section 772, subdivision (b) survives the passage of Proposition 103, it continues to preclude bank subsidiaries from licensure as, or from acting as, insurance agents or brokers.
 

  I
 

  Of the five initiative measures on the November 1988 ballot relating to insurance, Proposition 103 was the only one that received a majority of the votes for passage. The defining hallmark of Proposition 103 is a provision requiring that premiums for motor vehicle, fire and liability insurance policies issued or renewed after November 8, 1988, be reduced 20 percent below the rates in effect on November 8, 1987. (Ins. Code, § 1861.01, subd. (a).) The initiative also prohibits insurers, subject to limited exceptions, from cancelling or refusing to renew automobile insurance policies. (Ins. Code, § 1861.03, subd. (c).) Another provision of Proposition 103 repealed Insurance Code section 1643.
  
   1
  
  That section, with limited exceptions, prohibited banks, bank holding companies, and their subsidiaries and affiliates from being licensed as, or from acting as, insurance agents or brokers. Financial Code sections 772, subdivision (b) and 1208 deal generally with the same subject matter in respect to banks and their subsidiaries but are not mentioned in Proposition 103.
 

  On the day following passage of Proposition 103, a number of insurance companies jointly commenced a proceeding in the California Supreme Court challenging the constitutionality of the initiative on various grounds. The Supreme Court decided that case in May 1989 and upheld the initiative against most of the claims of unconstitutionality.

  was pending, several state banks filed applications with the Commissioner for licenses to sell general lines of insurance. Over the objection of plaintiffs, the Commissioner announced the Department of
   
   *607
   
  Insurance would not reject an application from a state-chartered bank for an insurance agency or brokerage license. In taking this position, the Commissioner relied upon a January 4, 1989, “interpretive opinion” of the Superintendent of Banks (Superintendent) which concluded Proposition 103 impliedly repealed Financial Code sections 772, subdivision (b) and 1208.
 

  Shortly thereafter, the Commissioner began to license state-chartered banks as insurance agents. The Commissioner made plain an intent to continue to issue such licenses to banking organizations as applications were received and processed.
 

  Plaintiffs then initiated in superior court the action from which this appeal arises, asking the court to: (1) declare the Superintendent’s “interpretive opinion” legally erroneous in its conclusion that Proposition 103 impliedly repealed Financial Code sections 772, subdivision (b) and 1208; (2) direct the Commissioner to rescind the licenses issued to banks pursuant to the invalid interpretation; and (3) enjoin the Commissioner from further licensing of banks to engage in the general insurance agency or brokerage business.
 

  Following hearing and argument, the trial court denied the requested relief, ruling Proposition 103, in expressly repealing Insurance Code section 1643, by implication repealed Financial Code sections 772, subdivision (b) and 1208, thereby eliminating any statutory impediments to the licensure of banks and their subsidiaries as insurance agents or brokers.
 

  II
 

  Before turning to the merits, we set forth the relevant provisions of those sections of the Insurance Code and Financial Code which are implicated in this action. With limited exceptions not relevant here, Insurance Code section 1643, which was expressly repealed by Proposition 103, provided that no bank, bank holding company, subsidiary, or affiliate thereof may be licensed as or act as an insurance agent or broker in California. Thus, Insurance Code section 1643 operated as a general prohibition against banks and their subsidiaries engaging in the insurance business.

   *608
   
  Financial Code section 1208 provides a commercial bank located in a place not exceeding 5,000 in population “may act as agent for any fire, life or other insurance company authorized to do business in California ... if the bank is engaged in such business on October 1, 1949, and is duly licensed under the Insurance Code[.]”

  Financial Code section 772 states in relevant part: “(a) [A] bank may invest in the capital stock, obligations, or other securities of one or more corporations. [¶] (b) No such corporation may act as an insurance company, insurance agent, or insurance broker.”
  
   4
  


  In his interpretive opinion the Superintendent concluded that in light of the express repeal of Insurance Code section 1643, Proposition 103 impliedly repealed Financial Code section 1208 to the extent that section constitutes an implicit denial of plenary authorization to banks (except for those banks expressly so authorized therein) to engage in the insurance business, and impliedly repealed subdivision (b) of Financial Code section 772 to the extent that section prohibits corporations in which banks have invested from acting as insurance agents or brokers. The trial court agreed with the Superintendent’s conclusions and held that banks and their subsidiaries may now engage in the insurance agency and brokerage business.
 

 
   *609
   
  We agree with the trial court’s conclusion that as a result of Proposition 103’s express repeal of Insurance Code section 1643,
  
   banks
  
  may now engage in the insurance agency and brokerage business. However, we disagree with the trial court’s conclusion that Proposition 103 impliedly repealed Financial Code section 772, subdivision (b). Neither the initiative itself nor the accompanying ballot materials in any way suggested the measure was designed to allow bank
  
   subsidiaries
  
  to act as insurance agents or brokers. In the absence of any such evidence, and because the continuing viability of Financial Code section 772, subdivision (b) may be harmonized with the provisions of the initiative, bank subsidiaries may not engage in the insurance agency and brokerage business. Furthermore, we disagree with the trial court’s conclusion that Proposition 103 impliedly repealed Financial Code section 1208. Nevertheless, that does not alter our conclusion that express repeal of Insurance Code section 1643 removes all statutory impediments to banks engaging in the insurance agency and brokerage business because there is nothing contained in Financial Code section 1208 that prohibits them from doing so.
 

  Ill
 

  We address first the issue whether Proposition 103 was intended to allow banks to be licensed as and to act as insurance agents and brokers. Although plaintiffs make several claims in support of their assertion the measure intended no such result, their arguments lack both merit and conviction.
 

  In ascertaining the meaning of an initiative, a court first looks to the language in which it is framed. (Cf.
  
   AFL-CIO
  
  v.
  
   Deukmejian
  
  (1989) 212 Cal.App.3d 425, 433 [260 Cal.Rptr. 479].) “If the language is clear, the [initiative] statute must be enforced according to its terms.”
  
   (Ibid.)
  
  “ ‘[It] is a settled principle in California law that “When statutory language [in an initiative] is . . . clear and unambiguous there is no need for construction, and courts should not indulge in it.” [Citation.]’ ”
  
   (In re Lance W.
  
  (1985) 37 Cal.3d 873, 886 [210 Cal.Rptr. 631, 694 P.2d 744].)
 

  The language of Proposition 103 unambiguously demonstrates the voters intended to remove restrictions on banks engaging in the insurance business and to permit them to sell all lines of insurance. Proposition 103 expressly repealed Insurance Code section 1643, the sole statutory prohibition forbidding banks from licensure as, or from acting as, insurance agents. Section 2 of Proposition 103 states that among its purposes are “to encourage a competitive insurance marketplace . . . and to ensure that insurance is fair, available, and affordable for all Californians.” (Prop. 103, § 2.) These words, when read “ ‘ “in a sense which harmonizes with the subject-matter
   
   *610
   
  and the general purpose and object” ’ ” of the measure
  
   (Creighton
  
  v.
  
   City of Santa Monica
  
  (1984) 160 Cal.App.3d 1011, 1018 [207 Cal.Rptr. 78]), leave no doubt the voters intended to make insurance more competitive by allowing banks to compete in the insurance marketplace. To accomplish that, Insurance Code section 1643 prohibiting banks from that activity was expressly repealed.
 

  While we believe the initiative is clear on its face, a resort to extrinsic interpretive materials buttresses our conclusion the measure was intended to allow banks to enter the insurance marketplace.  In ascertaining the intent of the voters, it is appropriate to consider the ballot pamphlet in which a measure is presented, including the summary, analysis and arguments.
  
   (Legislature
  
  v.
  
   Deukmejian
  
  (1983) 34 Cal.3d 658, 673, fn. 14 [194 Cal.Rptr. 781, 669 P.2d 17].)
 

  Plaintiffs argue there “is no hint anywhere in the ballot materials” that Proposition 103 would permit banks “unfettered entry” into the business of selling insurance. Yet, the Attorney General’s ballot summary for Proposition 103 states the initiative “[a]uthorizes insurance activities by banks,” an object which is consistent with the stated intent “to ensure that insurance is fair, available, and affordable for all Californians” (Prop. 103, § 2).
  
   5
  


  Plaintiffs acknowledge “the Attorney General’s summary may be one indication of the voters’ intent,” but assert the phrase “insurance activities” is too vague to be meaningful. However, besides section 7 which repeals Insurance Code section 1643, there is no other operative provision of Proposition 103 which specifically addresses insurance activities of banks. The only referent of the statement in the ballot summary that the initiative “authorizes insurance activities by banks” is section 7 which repeals Insurance Code section 1643. Thus, activities prohibited by Insurance Code section 1643 are included in, if not coterminous with, the “insurance activities” referred to in the ballot summary. By voting to repeal Insurance Code section 1643, the electorate intended at least to permit those activities previously prohibited by force of that section alone.
  
   6
  


  We note the issue whether Proposition 103 was designed to allow banks to enter the insurance marketplace was addressed, albeit briefly, in
  
   Calfarm,
  
 
   *611
   

   supra,
  
  48 Cal.3d 805. One of the challenges to Proposition 103 in
  
   Calfarm
  
  was that the measure violated the single-subject rule (Cal. Const., art. II, § 8, subd. (d)) because, inter alia, the repeal of laws that prohibited banks from selling insurance was not related to and would not further the goals of the measure. (48 Cal.3d at p. 841.) In rejecting this contention the
  
   Calfarm
  
  court held: “It is apparent that one could reasonably believe that . . . permitting banks to compete in selling insurance will lower the cost of insurance. [W]e do not review initiatives by attempting to predict whether each section actually will further the initiative’s purpose. Instead, we inquire only whether the provisions are ‘reasonably germane’ to the general purpose or objective of the initiative. [Citation.] All of the provisions of Proposition 103 relate generally to the cost of insurance or the regulation thereof, and all (including those of which intervenor complains [i.e., allowing banks to sell insurance]) at least arguably will help to achieve the goal of making insurance more affordable and available. We therefore find no violation of the single-subject rule.”
  
   (Id.
  
  at pp. 841-842.)
 

  We are enjoined to give meaning and effect to every part of an act in pursuance of the legislative purpose.
  
   (Select Base Materials
  
  v.
  
   Board of Equal.
  
  (1959) 51 Cal.2d 640, 645 [335 P.2d 672].)  We also presume from the repeal of a statute an intent to effect a substantial change in the law.
  
   (People
  
  v.
  
   Dillon
  
  (1983) 34 Cal.3d 441, 467 [194 Cal.Rptr. 390, 668 P.2d 697].)  “The general objective of the [measure] is a prime consideration; it is to be construed with a view to promoting rather than defeating its general purpose.”
  
   (Redevelopment Agency
  
  v.
  
   Malaki
  
  (1963) 216 Cal.App.2d 480, 487 [31 Cal.Rptr. 92].)  One of the main purposes of Proposition 103 as set forth in the ballot summary was to allow banks to engage in insurance activities. The voters’ express repeal of Insurance Code section , 1643 was the essential step in reaching that objective.
 

  IV
 

  Having concluded the intent of the initiative was to allow banks to enter the insurance marketplace, we address the question whether there is any existing statutory impediment to implementing this intent. The trial court concluded that because Financial Code section 1208 expressly permits only a limited class of banks restricted access to the insurance marketplace, that section by implication denies all other banks authority to engage in the insurance business. Although it found a prohibitive dimension to Financial Code section 1208, the trial court held that this implicit prohibition did not prevent banks from engaging in insurance activities because it concluded Proposition 103 had impliedly repealed Financial Code section 1208.
 

  Plaintiffs agree with the trial court that Financial Code section 1208 has an implicit prohibitive dimension but take issue with the trial court’s deter-
   
   *612
   
  initiation that section 1208 has been repealed by implication. Plaintiffs argue the evidence is “debatable” whether or not the voters intended to eliminate all hurdles to bank entry into the business of selling insurance. Noting Proposition 103 makes no mention of Financial Code section 1208, plaintiffs contend this omission was deliberate because the Financial Code prohibits insurance
  
   activities
  
  by banks and has a different purpose than the prohibition against
  
   licensure
  
  of banks to engage in such activities formerly contained in Insurance Code section 1643. The gist of plaintiffs’ argument is that the voters’ repeal of Insurance Code section 1643 was intended to do nothing more than remove the prohibition precluding banks from being
  
   licensed
  
  to sell insurance. But since Proposition 103 did not mention Financial Code section 1208, there is no reason to believe the voters intended to remove the barriers prohibiting banks from actually
  
   selling
  
  insurance. Plaintiffs assert the voters were content to await future action by the Legislature or state or federal bank regulators to remove what they contend is the implied prohibition in Financial Code section 1208 against banks actually selling insurance.
  
   7
  


  Viewed most generously, the persuasive force of plaintiffs’ arguments is exceedingly exiguous. Plaintiffs’ claims assume (1) former Insurance Code section 1643 did nothing more than preclude the licensing of banks to sell insurance, and (2) Financial Code section 1208 is somehow repugnant to the electorate’s decision taken through the repeal of Insurance Code section 1643 to allow banks to enter the insurance business. Both assumptions are patently erroneous.
 

  First, former Insurance Code section 1643 did more than merely prohibit the licensing of banks to sell insurance. By its terms, that section also prohibited banks from “act[ing] as an agent or broker for insurance.” (See fn. 2,
  
   ante.)
  


  Second, as earlier indicated, the ballot summary stated Proposition 103 “[a]uthorizes insurance activities by banks.” This statement of purpose is not merely hortatory, a call for future legislation. Indeed, the initiative calls for immediate implementation of its provisions and not in gradual or piecemeal fashion. (Cal. Const., art II, § 10, subd. (a); see Prop. 103, § 3.)
 

 
   *613
   
  Finally, and most importantly, there is nothing within Financial Code section 1208 which is inconsistent with the notion that all banks may now enter the insurance marketplace. Financial Code section 1208 is an express
  
   grant
  
  of authority to a limited class of banks to sell specified types of insurance. (Stats. 1919, ch. 337, § 1, p. 622; see Tenth-Annual Rep. of the Superintendent of Banks (1919) pp. 15-16.) It does not, merely because of its limited permissive application, impliedly prohibit all banks not described therein generally from selling insurance. The legislative history of the section confirms this interpretation. (Tenth-Annual Rep. of the Superintendent of Banks,
  
   supra,
  
  at pp. 15-16; see also
  
   Independent Ins. Agents
  
  v.
  
   Bd. of Governors
  
  (8th Cir. 1984) 736 F.2d 468, 477, fn. 6;
  
   Independent Bankers Ass’n
  
  v.
  
   Heimann
  
  (D.C. Cir. 1979) 613 F.2d 1164, 1170; cf.
  
   Saxon
  
  v.
  
   Georgia Ass’n of Independent Ins. Agents, Inc.
  
  (5th Cir. 1968) 399 F.2d 1010, 1013-1014.) And if there were any doubt that Financial Code section 1208 has this effect, that doubt is resolved by Corporations Code section 206, which authorizes “a corporation subject to the Banking Law . . . [to] engage in any business activity not prohibited by the respective statutes and regulations to which it is subject.”
 

  Prior to Proposition 103, the
  
   sole
  
  statutory provision prohibiting banks from being licensed as, or from acting as, insurance agents or brokers was Insurance Code section 1643. That barrier has now been removed by the passage of the initiative measure. Because nothing in Financial Code section 1208 provides to the contrary, there is no legitimate issue of its implied repeal by Proposition 103 tendered by this litigation.
 

  IV
 

  As we have noted, Financial Code section 772, subdivision (a) authorizes state-chartered banks to invest in the securities of one or more corporations, but subdivision (b) provides: “No such corporation may act as an insurance company, insurance agent, or insurance broker. . . .” Before its repeal, Insurance Code section 1643, also prohibited bank subsidiaries, as well as banks from acting as or being licensed as insurance agents or brokers.
  
   8
  


  The trial court concluded the only way to give effect to the intent of the electorate in repealing Insurance Code section 1643 was to find Financial Code section 772, subdivision (b) has been repealed by implication.  That conclusion was based on the principle that a repeal by implication will be found (1) where the two acts are so inconsistent that there is no
   
   *614
   
  possibility of concurrent operation, or (2) where the later provision gives undebatable evidence of an intent to supersede the earlier.
  
   (Hays
  
  v.
  
   Wood
  
  (1979) 25 Cal.3d 772, 784 [160 Cal.Rptr. 102, 603 P.2d 19].)
  
   9
  


  In our view, there is no inconsistency between the provisions of Financial Code section 772, subdivision (b) and those of Proposition 103 such as to warrant a finding of repeal by implication.  There is a strong presumption against the implied repeal of a statute or constitutional provision by subsequent enactment. (See
  
   Western Oil & Gas Assn.
  
  v.
  
   Monterey Bay Unified Air Pollution Control Dist.
  
  (1989) 49 Cal.3d 408, 419-420 [261 Cal.Rptr. 384, 777 P.2d 157];
  
   Hays
  
  v.
  
   Wood, supra,
  
  25 Cal.3d at p. 784.) “The presumption against implied repeal is so strong that, ‘To overcome the presumption the two acts must be irreconcilable, clearly repugnant, and so inconsistent that the two cannot have concurrent operation. The courts are bound, if possible, to maintain the integrity of both statutes if the two may stand together.’ [Citation.] There must be ‘no
  
   possibility
  
  of concurrent operation.’ [Citation.] Courts have also noted an implied repeal should not be found unless *. . .the later provision gives
  
   undebatable evidence
  
  of an intent to supersede the earlier . . . .’” (Italics in original;
  
   Western Oil & Gas Assn., supra,
  
  49 Cal.3d at pp. 419-420.)
 

  Moreover, it has been held a claim of repeal by implication should be viewed with even greater than ordinary circumspection when the claim stems from the express repeal of another statute. “ ‘[W]hen the legislature repeals certain acts and excludes mention of other acts even though they refer to the same subject, it is the intention of the legislature to leave standing those acts which are not mentioned.’ ”
  
   (People
  
  v.
  
   Deibert
  
  (1953) 117 Cal.App.2d 410, 417 [256 P.2d 355].)
 

  The first test for implied repeal is to determine whether there is “undebatable evidence” the later act was intended to supersede the earlier.
  
   (Hays
  
  v.
  
   Wood, supra,
  
  25 Cal.3d at p. 784.)  Proposition 103 is silent with regard to intent to allow bank subsidiaries either to sell insurance or to be licensed as insurance agents or brokers. Although the initiative did repeal Insurance Code section 1643, that in itself does not provide the undebatable evidence necessary to conclude both banks and their subsidiaries were to be allowed to enter the insurance business.
 

  Similarly unhelpful are the ballot materials accompanying the initiative. Although in his summary the Attorney General indicated the effect of the
   
   *615
   
  initiative was to allow banks to sell insurance, the summary made no mention of subsidiaries. The Attorney General’s summary “cannot supply language which does not appear [on the face of the initiative]”
  
   (Metropolitan Water District
  
  v. Dorff (1979) 98 Cal.App.3d 109, 115 [159 Cal.Rptr. 211]). A fortiori, the failure of the summary to include language otherwise lacking from the initiative is even more conclusive. There is no hint either in the initiative itself or in the accompanying ballot materials that Proposition 103 was designed to allow bank subsidiaries entry into the insurance business.
  
   10
  


  This analysis is buttressed by reference to Proposition 100, one of the four other initiative measures on the same ballot designed to affect the insurance industry in California. In his interpretive opinion, the Superintendent concluded reference to Proposition 100 was proper in light of the fact that this initiative, like Proposition 103, also concerned both banks and insurance. Like Proposition 103, Proposition 100, which failed to pass, would have expressly repealed Insurance Code section 1643. (Prop. 100, § 11) Unlike Proposition 103, Proposition 100 also would have expressly repealed Financial Code section 772, subdivision (b). (Prop. 100, § 11) Noting the Attorney General’s ballot summary for both Propositions was the same with regard to banks and insurance—i.e., “[authorizes insurance activities by banks”—the Superintendent reasoned “banks” as used in the summaries referred both to banks and to their subsidiaries. The Superintendent thus concluded that even though Proposition 103 made no express reference to Financial Code section 772, subdivision (b), the clear intent of the initiative was to allow both banks and their subsidiaries to enter the insurance marketplace.
 

  We agree with the Superintendent that in the unique circumstances of the November 1988 General Election in which there were five initiative measures relating to insurance on the ballot, two of which, Propositions 100 and 103, addressed both insurance and banks, resort to Proposition 100 as an interpretive aid is warranted. However, we disagree with the Superintendent’s conclusion that Financial Code section 772, subdivision (b) was impliedly repealed by the passage of Proposition 103. There was a substantial difference between Proposition 100 and Proposition 103: Proposition 103 made no mention whatsoever of section 772, subdivision (b). While the Superintendent labeled this failure an “insignificant point of detail,” we think otherwise. In rejecting Proposition 100 the voters rejected the express repeal of Financial Code section 772, subdivision (b). This rejection is not insignificant.
 

 
   *616
   
  The trial court also seemed to suggest that, absent a finding Financial Code section 772, subdivision (b) was impliedly repealed, the voters who approved Proposition 103 would be penalized for the failure of its drafters expressly to include repeal of an “obscure” provision such as Financial Code section 772, subdivision (b). Yet, those who drafted Proposition 100 were obviously aware of that section, and the drafters of Proposition 103 were aware of the provisions of Proposition 100, as they urged the electors to vote “ ‘Yes’ ” only on Proposition 103.
 

  “The enacting body is deemed to be aware of existing laws and judicial constructions in effect at the time legislation is enacted. [Citation.] This principle applies to legislation enacted by initiative. [Citation.]”
  
   (People
  
  v.
  
   Weidert
  
  (1985) 39 Cal.3d 836, 844 [218 Cal.Rptr. 57, 705 P.2d 380].)  We do not find in the record undebatable evidence the electorate, aware of the prohibitions contained in Financial Code section 772, subdivision (b), prohibiting bank subsidiaries from licensure as, or from acting as, insurance agents or brokers, intended to repeal them. In the absence of such undebatable evidence, we may not venture beyond the plain meaning of the initiative.
 

  The second test for implied repeal, whether the provisions of the sections at issue are so completely inconsistent that they cannot coexist, is likewise not satisfied in this case. The courts are bound to maintain the integrity of both the later and preexisting statutes if there is any possibility of concurrent operation.
  
   (Western Oil & Gas Assn., supra,
  
  49 Cal.3d at pp. 419-420.) The provisions of Proposition 103 and those of Financial Code section 772, subdivision (b) can be reconciled. By repealing Insurance Code section 1643, the voters manifested their intent to allow banks into the insurance business. By
  
   failing
  
  to repeal the provisions of Financial Code section 772, subdivision (b), they continued the prohibition against bank subsidiaries entering into such business. These acts are not so inconsistent that they cannot stand together. Indeed, they are not inconsistent at all. The repeal of Insurance Code section 1643, by removing the long-established barrier to banks themselves selling insurance, has significance in and of itself whether or not bank subsidiaries are granted a like indulgence.
 

  If there is a question as to the wisdom of allowing banks, but not their subsidiaries, to enter the insurance business, it is a sufficient answer that the wisdom of the initiative measure is not before us.  The courts “ ‘ “must follow the language used and give to it its plain meaning, whatever may be thought of the wisdom, expediency, or policy of the act, even if it appears probable that a different object was in the mind of the legislature.” ’ [Citation.]”
  
   (People
  
  v.
  
   Weidert, supra,
  
  39 Cal.3d at p. 843.) Accordingly, this court is in no position to expand upon the express terms of the initiative in
   
   *617
   
  order to further some hidden but assertedly wise objective of the voters. (Cf.
  
   Metropolitan Water District
  
  v.
  
   Dorff, supra,
  
  98 Cal.App.3d at p. 115.)
 

  Our preference for literalism is compelled by the constitutional doctrine of separation of powers. “ ‘It is an elementary proposition that courts only determine by construction the scope and intent of the law when the law itself is ambiguous or doubtful. ... To allow a court ... to say that the law must mean something different from ... its language, because the court may think that its penalties are unwise or harsh would make the judicial superior to the legislative branch of the government, and practically invest it with lawmaking power. The remedy ... is not in interpretation but in amendment or repeal.’ ” (Fn. omitted; 2A Sutherland, Statutory Construction (4th ed. 1984) § 46.03, p. 82.)
 

  The judgment is affirmed insofar as it denies plaintiffs’ request for a writ of mandate commanding the Commissioner to cease granting insurance license applications to banks and to rescind any such license previously issued to banks. The judgment is otherwise reversed and the matter remanded to the trial court with directions to issue a writ of mandate commanding the Commissioner to cease granting insurance license applications to bank subsidiaries and to rescind any insurance license previously issued to any such entity. The parties shall bear their own costs on appeal.
 

  Sparks, J., and Scotland, J., concurred.
 

  A petition for a rehearing was denied September 23, 1991, and appellants’ petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied November 14, 1991. Mosk, J., was of the opinion that the petition should be granted.

   At the time of its repeal Insurance Code section 1643 provided in relevant part: “No bank, or bank holding company, subsidiary, or affiliate thereof, or any officer or employee of a bank, bank holding company, subsidiary, or affiliate, may be licensed as an insurance agent or broker, or act as an agent or broker for insurance, in this state, or control a licensed insurance agent or broker, except that a bank or a bank holding company, subsidiary, or affiliate of a bank, may be issued a license to act as a life and disability insurance agent limited to the transaction of credit life and disability insurance, or an agent limited to the transaction of

   insurance which is limited solely to assuring repayment of the outstanding balance due on a specific extension of credit by a bank or bank holding company or its subsidiary in the event of the involuntary unemployment of the debtor, or both.

   Financial Code section 1208 provides: “A commercial bank located in a place the population of which does not exceed 5,000 persons according to the most recent official federal or state census may act as agent for any fire, life, or other insurance company authorized to do business in California by soliciting and selling insurance and collecting premiums and may receive for such services such fees and commissions as may be agreed upon with the insurance company if the bank is engaged in such business on October 1, 1949, and is duly licensed under the Insurance Code, and may act also as the broker or agent for others in making or procuring loans on real property located within 100 miles of the place in which the bank is located and may receive for such services a fee or a commission if it is engaged in such business on October 1, 1949, and is duly licensed. In engaging in either of such businesses the bank shall comply with all rules and regulations of the superintendent relating thereto and shall not guarantee either the principal or interest of any loan procured by it as broker or agent or assume or guarantee the payment of any premium on insurance policies written through it as agent or broker or guarantee the truth of any statement made by an insured in filing an application for insurance.”

   Financial Code section 772 in its entirety provides: “(a) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 1335, and subject to such regulations and rules as the superintendent may prescribe, a bank may invest in the capital stock, obligations, or other securities of one or more corporations. [¶] (b) No such corporation may act as an insurance company, insurance agent, or insurance broker. This prohibition shall not be deemed to exclude other possible restrictions with respect to the activities of such corporations.”
  


   5
  

   In other ballot materials the supporters of Proposition 103 state that with respect to insurance the initiative establishes a “new set of rules to create a competitive marketplace and prohibit excessive rates.”
  


   6
  

   Plaintiffs argue the ballot summary provides little detail regarding the kind or extent of insurance activities authorized for banks by Proposition 103. In our view, the connection between the ballot summary language regarding banks and Proposition 103’s repeal of Insurance Code section 1643 compensates for any lack of detail in the ballot summary.
  


   7
  

   In the trial court plaintiffs argued: “The repeal of [Insurance Code] Section 1643 removes state licensing barriers with respect to financial institutions that are not otherwise prohibited from selling insurance. State banks and bank subsidiaries generally remain precluded from insurance activities under [Financial Code] Section[ ] 1208 ... but the way is cleared for licensing those entities should the California [Legislature amend the banking laws to permit it. Similarly, there now is no state-law prohibition against licensing national banks ... as insurance agents or brokers; they may apply for such licenses if and when federal law is amended to allow those activities. [¶] There is nothing inherently irreconcilable in clearing barriers under one statutory scheme but having to await further legislative action under another statutory scheme to implement the contemplated changes fully.”
  


   8
  

   Insurance Code section 1643, subdivision (c) defined a subsidiary as any corporation owned in whole or in part by a bank; i.e., to be a subsidiary under that section, it was not necessary that a corporation be wholly owned or even controlled by a bank. Thus, under Financial Code section 772, any corporation in which a bank has invested was necessarily a bank subsidiary as defined in Insurance Code section 1643.
  


   9
  

   Plaintiffs argue certain statements made by the trial court in its ruling indicate the court did not apply the strict presumption against repeals by implication. The standard employed by the trial court is irrelevant. The issues presented in this proceeding involve pure questions of law and on review we are not bound to give deference to the trial court’s reasoning.

   Elections Code section 3570 provides in relevant part: “The ballot pamphlet shall contain [¶] (b) A copy of the specific constitutional or statutory provision, if any, which would be repealed or revised by each state measure.”

HOFFMAN, Judge:
Appellants contend that the lower court erred in quashing their appeal from an arbitration award. We agree and, accordingly, reverse the order of the lower court and remand for reinstatement of the appeal.
Appellee commenced this action in assumpsit against appellants in early 1977. The matter was submitted to compulsory arbitration, and on June 20, 1979, after hearing testimony, the arbitrators found for appellee in the amount of $7,500. The award of the arbitrators was docketed on June 27, 1979. Nineteen days later, on July 16, 1979, appellants filed an appeal from the arbitration award in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County. On that same day appellants purchased a money order for $241.18, the exact amount specified in a bill of costs which they had received from appellee, and their counsel sent it by certified mail to appellee’s counsel at the office address listed on papers which the latter had filed earlier in the litigation. Appel-lee’s counsel had, however, moved his office sometime during the pendency of the litigation, and consequently the envelope containing the money order for appellee’s accrued costs was returned unopened to appellants’ counsel on July 26, 1979, twenty-nine days after the docketing of the arbitration award. Realizing his mailing error, appellants’ counsel had the money order hand-delivered that same day to appellee’s counsel at his new address. Appellee has apparently retained the payment of costs to date.
On August 21, 1979, appellee filed a motion to quash appellant’s appeal from the arbitration award. The basis of the motion was appellants’ failure to pay appellee’s accrued costs within twenty days, pursuant to 5 P.S. § 71 (repealed).1 *199Appellee noted in his motion that appellants had tendered the costs on July 26, but contended that such tender was untimely. The lower court agreed and granted appellee’s motion to quash. This appeal followed.
Appellants contend that they made an honest effort to pay all appellee’s accrued costs within twenty days after the docketing of the arbitration award, and that the mere fact that they inadvertently mailed their payment to the wrong address does not warrant the quashing of their appeal.2 We *200agree. The payment of costs requirement of 5 P.S. § 71 has been held to be mandatory and jurisdictional. James F. Oakley, Inc. v. School District of Philadelphia, 464 Pa. 330, 334-35, 346 A.2d 765, 767 (1975). Nonetheless, our Court has held that
a valid attempt to make such timely and full payment, coupled with substantial though incomplete compliance with the requirement should not result in the harsh finality of an order quashing an appeal from arbitration. Rather, our courts should examine the appellant’s attempts at compliance in order to determine whether an honest effort has been made to meet the requirements of the statute.
Black and Brown, Inc. v. Home for the Accepted, Inc., 233 Pa.Super. 518, 522, 335 A.2d 722, 724 (1975) (footnote omitted). See also Sager & Sager Associates v. Bock, 280 Pa.Super. 459, 421 A.2d 812 (1980); Mikita v. Bailey Homes, Inc., 265 Pa.Super. 399, 401 A.2d 1367 (1979); Lehman v. Moody, 260 Pa.Super. 428, 394 A.2d 1002 (1978); Friedgen v. Evangelical Manor, 253 Pa.Super. 216, 384 A.2d 1309 (1978). In Sager & Sager Associates v. Bock, supra, we applied this principle and reversed an order quashing an appeal from compulsory arbitration under the following circumstances. After filing an appeal from an adverse arbitration award, the defendants inquired at the prothonotary’s office to ascertain the plaintiff’s accrued costs. Upon being informed that the docket reflected costs of $200, they paid that amount to the prothonotary. Subsequently, the plaintiff successfully moved to quash the appeal on the ground that the defendants had failed to pay certain filing and sheriff’s fees totalling $40.65, of which the prothonotary had failed to inform them. We reversed, holding that “[t]he fact that the prothonotary erroneously did not include plaintiff’s filing *201fee and sheriff’s fee in the total does not change the fact that defendants] made a timely attempt to pay all the costs, though this later proved to be incomplete compliance.” 280 Pa.Super. at 461, 421 A.2d at 813. Cf. Black and Brown, Inc. v. Home for the Accepted, Inc., supra (trial court properly quashed appeal from compulsory arbitration where appellant made no attempt whatsoever to pay any costs during appeal period).
We believe that the facts of the present case warrant the same result as that reached in Sager & Sager Associates v. Bock, supra. Appellants made an honest attempt to pay all appellee’s accrued costs within twenty days after the docketing of the arbitration award. Had they mailed their payment to the proper address they would have been in full compliance with the payment of costs requirement of 5 P.S. § 71. As soon as appellants discovered their mailing error, they attempted to rectify it by promptly hand-delivering payment to appellee’s attorney at his new office. We are unpersuaded by appellee’s efforts to characterize what appears to be an honest mistake as a calculated effort to delay the proceedings.3 Accordingly, we reverse the order of the lower court and remand for reinstatement of the appeal.
So ordered.

. Section 71, in relevant part, required a party wishing to appeal an arbitration award to “pay all costs that may have accrued in such suit or action,” § 71(11), “within twenty days after the day of the entry of the award of the arbitrators on the docket,” § 71(IV). *199Pursuant to the Act of April 28, 1978, P.L. 202, No. 53, § 2(a) [149], clause IV of section 71 was repealed effective June 23, 1978. Most of the remainder of section 71 was repealed effective June 27, 1980. Payment of accrued costs is no longer a requirement for perfecting appeals from compulsory arbitration. See Pa.R.Civ.P. 1308 (effective May 15, 1981) and its accompanying Explanatory Note.


. Appellants contend additionally that pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 5571(b), the statutory period for perfecting their appeal from compulsory arbitration was 30, rather than 20 days as the lower court held. Thus, appellants argue, their tender of the accrued costs on July 26, 29 days after the docketing of the award, constituted full and timely compliance with the payment of costs requirement in effect at the time they took their appeal. Appellee responds that this contention is waived because appellants did not raise it in the court below. We need not address this matter because of our conclusion that even if appellants had only 20 days in which to perfect their appeal, they substantially complied with the payment of costs requirement within that time period. We note, however, that at the time appellants filed their appeal in the lower court, the statutory period for perfecting an appeal from compulsory arbitration was (and still is) 30 days. In concluding that appellants’ tender of costs was untimely, the lower court relied on 5 P.S. § 71(IV), which established a 20-day period for the perfecting of appeals from compulsory arbitration. See note 1 supra. Section 71 (IV), however, was no longer in effect when appellants filed their appeal from arbitration, having been repealed effective June 23, 1978. See note 1 supra. Since the repeal of section 71 (IV), the time period for perfecting appeals from compulsory arbitration has been governed by 42 Pa.C. S.A. § 5571(b), which states in relevant part: “[A]n appeal from a tribunal or other government unit to a court ... must be commenced within 30 days after the entry of the order from which the appeal is taken .... ” See Acri v. Wintermeyer, 285 Pa.Super. 486, 428 A.2d 150 (1981) (local rule of court establishing 20-day period for appeals from compulsory arbitration invalid because in conflict with section 5571(b)); Turner v. May Corp., 285 Pa.Super. 241, 427 A.2d 203 (1981) (section 5571(b) establishes time period for perfecting appeals from compulsory arbitration); Lewis v. Erie Insurance Exchange, 281 Pa.Super. 193, 200 n.7, 421 A.2d 1214, 1218 n.7 (1980) (noting in *200dictum that “an award by a board of arbitrators in a compulsory arbitration would be subject to the thirty day appeal period specified in ... § 5571[(b)].”). The 30-day appeal period mandated by section 5571(b) has been expressly incorporated into our rules of civil procedure. See Pa.R.Civ.P. 1308(a)(1) (effective May 15, 1981). See also former Pa.R.Civ.P. 247.1 (rescinded effective May 15, 1981).


. We recognize, as the lower court pointed out in its opinion, that appellants should have been aware of appellee’s counsel’s new address inasmuch as it was plainly printed on the bill of costs submitted to them immediately after the arbitrators made their award. This oversight, however, does not alter our conclusion that appellants made an honest effort to comply fully with the payment of costs requirement and therefore should not suffer the “harsh finality” of having their appeal quashed.

   MEMORANDUM
  


  SYLVIA H. RAMBO, District Judge.
 

  The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Department of Environmental Protection, (“PADEP”), brought this action for the recovery of response costs incurred in the cleanup of Strontium-90, (“Sr-90”), a radioactive and hazardous nuclear byproduct material, at or from the Quehanna Wild Area Nuclear Site in the Quehanna Wild Area of the Moshannon State Forest in Clearfield County, Pennsylvania, (“site”). Defendant Lockheed Martin Corporation’s, (“LMC”), predecessor, the Martin-Marietta Corporation, was the last known user of Sr-90 at the site.
  
   1
  


  PADEP’s cost recovery claims arise from Section 107(a) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended 42 U.S.C. §§ 9601-9675, (“CERCHA”), and certain environmental statutes and common law of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, including the Hazardous Sites Cleanup Act, (“HSCA”), 35 P.S. §§ 6020.101-6020.1305; the Solid Waste Management Act, (“SWMA”), 35 P.S. §§ 6018.101-6018.1003; the Clean Streams Law, (“CSL”), 35 P.S. §§ 691.1-691.1001; and Section 1917-A of the Administrative Code of 1929, 71 P.S. § 510-17. LMC has brought a motion to dismiss PADEP’s Amended Complaint in its entirety.
 

  I.
  
   Background
  


  A.
  
   Facts
  


  The following facts are taken from PA-DEP’s Amended Complaint and matters of public record which are judicially noticeable. Specifically, the court takes judicial notice of certain facts and background information appearing in the Federal Register.
  
   2
  
  For the purposes of deciding LMC’s motion to dismiss, all of the facts are taken as true, and have been construed in the light most favorable to PADEP.
 

  1.
  
   Quehanna Wild Area Nuclear Site
  


  The Quehanna Wild Area Nuclear Site is located near Karthus, Clearfield County, Pennsylvania, in the Quehanna Wild Area of the Moshannon State Forest, and is approximately seven acres in size, heavily wooded, and sparsely populated.
  
   See
  
  Nuclear Regulatory Commission Notice, 71 Fed.Reg. 59,839-40 (Oct. 11, 2006) (“Commission Notice”). The site contains one large building, several smaller buildings, asphalt parking lots and driveways, a septic system leach field used for sanitary sewer waste, and an approximately one acre pond.
  
   Id.
  
  The main building was constructed to house a pool reactor and associated laboratories, hot cells, and of
   
   *568
   
  fices. Auxiliary buildings included a waste water treatment building, associated underground tanks, piping, and a water storage building.
  
   Id.
  


  The site was constructed in 1957 after the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania enacted legislation for the location of a research facility that was to be operated by the Curtiss-Wright Corporation.
  
   Id.
  
  In 1958, the Atomic Energy Commission
  
   3
  
  issued a license to Curtiss-Wright to operate a pool reactor at the facility; the license included use of the hot cells and laboratories.
  
   Id.
  
  In 1960, Curtiss-Wright donated the facilities to the Pennsylvania State University, (“Penn State”), which planned to use the reactor for training and research; Penn State leased the hot cells to LMC.
  
   Id.
  


  There were six hot cells in the main building on the site. (Doc. 3, Amend. Compl. ¶ 6.) The hot cells were large steel-lined, high-density concrete rooms that provided shielded work areas for high activity radiation work including encapsulation and irradiation.
  
   (Id.)
  
  From 1962 through 1967, LMC used the hot cells to manufacture thermoelectric generators known as SNAP generators. Commission Notice, 71 Fed.Reg. at 59,840. The SNAP generators contained Sr-90, a radioactive isotope that constitutes “byproduct material” within the meaning of the Atomic Energy Act (“AEA”).
  
   Id.
  
  At all times, LMC possessed and used Sr-90 pursuant to a Byproduct Material License No. 19-1398-29 issued by the Commission. Atomic Energy Commission, Notice of Issuance of Byproduct Material License, 27 Fed.Reg. 6341 (July 3, 1962); Notice of Proposed Issuance of Byproduct Material License, 27 Fed.Reg. 5518 (June 6,1962).
 

  In 1967, LMC terminated its lease for use of the hot cells after performing partial decontamination. Commission Notice, 71 Fed.Reg. at 59,840. However, “licensable quantities of Sr-90 contamination remained in the hot cells and associated facilities.”
  
   Id.
  
  These quantities of Sr-90 were left in the hot cells, piping, and tanks in the main building at the site. (Doc. 3, Amend. Compl. ¶ 10.) LMC was the last user of Sr-90 at the site. Commission Notice, 71 Fed.Reg. at 59,840. Also in 1967, Penn State returned the site back to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, which subsequently leased it to a subsidiary of Atlantic-Richfield Corporation, and later to other companies, all of whom worked with hazardous substances. PADEP took control over all operations at the site in December 2002.
  
   Id.
  


  2.
  
   Site Cleanup
  


  In the early 1990s, PADEP contracted with a company to perform a site assessment which revealed that nearly all parts of the interconnected structure, including the hot cells, Service Area, waste water treatment building, associated drain lines, reactor bay, the inside of the walls, under floor coverings of the administration area, and the underlying soils were contaminated with Sr-90. (Doc. 3, Amend. Compl. ¶11.)
 

  In 1998, a decommissioning plan was submitted by PADEP to the Commission, with a revision of the plan submitted in 2003. In May of 2005, a survey by the
   
   *569
   
  Commission revealed that the site did not meet release criteria approved in the 2003 decommissioning plan “because Sr-90 had leached to the surface of the concrete resulting in contamination levels in excess of the release limits.” Commission Notice, 71 Fed.Reg. at 59,840. Specifically, this finding indicated that concrete thought to contain only surface contamination was “volumetrically contaminated.”
  
   Id.
  


  Since the first decommissioning plan was submitted, PADEP has taken response actions at the site, including the removal and disposal of residual Sr-90; demolition of the site structures and monitoring; as well as sampling the site to ensure that it met release criteria for Sr-90 and other hazardous wastes. (Doc. 3, Amend. Compl. ¶ 16.) The decommissioning and cleanup of the site has been complete since, at the latest, June 27, 2009.
  
   See
  
  39 Pa. Bull. 3223 (June 27, 2009). As of the filing of its original complaint, PA-DEP has incurred more than $20,000,000 in unreimbursed response costs related to the cleanup and removal of the Sr-90 contamination left by LMC.
 

  B.
  
   Procedural History
  


  PADEP filed its initial complaint on April 30, 2009, (Doc. 1), and an Amended Complaint on May 7, 2009, (Doc. 3). On July 6, 2009, LMC filed its motion to dismiss and brief in support. (Docs. 16-17.) On August 12, 2009, PADEP filed its brief in opposition to LMC’s motion. (Doc. 23.) On August 31, 2009, LMC filed its reply brief. (Doc. 26.) The motion is ripe for disposition, and for the reasons that follow it will be denied.
 

  II.
  
   Legal Standard
  


  Among other requirements, a sound complaint must set forth “a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.” Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2). This statement must “give the defendant fair notice of what the ... claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.”

  551 U.S. 89, 94, 127 S.Ct. 2197, 167 L.Ed.2d 1081 (2007), and all reasonable inferences permitted by the factual allegations,

   Discussion
  


  In its motion to dismiss, LMC asserts that all of PADEP’s claims fail to state a claim as a matter of law. As to PADEP’s CERCLA claims, LMC makes a two pronged attack: (1) CERCLA has no applicability to the decommissioning of the Quehanna Facility; and (2) the releases allegedly caused by LMC at the site are excluded under the plain terms of the statute. As to PADEP’s state causes of action, LMC argues that each is preempted by the Atomic Energy Act. The court will address each of LMC’s arguments in turn.
 

  A.
  
   CERCLA
  


  Before the court addresses the specifics of LMC’s arguments, an overview of CERCLA is necessary. In response to widespread concern over the improper disposal of hazardous wastes, Congress enacted CERCLA, “a complex piece of legislation designed to force polluters to pay for costs associated with remedying their pollution.”
  
   United States v. Alcan Aluminum Corp.,
  
  964 F.2d 252, 258 (3d Cir.1992) (citing
  
   A Legislative History of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980,
  
  Senate Comm. of Env’t
  
   &
  
  Pub. Works
  
   (“A Legislative History”),
  
  S. Doc. No. 97-14, 97th Cong.2d Sess.1983, Vol. I, at 320 (one of the statute’s principal goals is “assuring that those who caused chemical harm bear the costs of that harm.... ”)).
 

  CERCLA is a remedial statute which provides for strict liability, and should be construed liberally to effectuate its goals.
  
   Alcan Aluminum,
  
  964 F.2d at 258-59; 42 U.S.C. § 9601(32). The statute embodies a bifurcated scheme to promote the cleanup of hazardous sites, spills, and releases. First, CERCLA grants broad authority to the executive branch to provide for the cleanup of hazardous waste sites.
  
   See
  
  42 U.S.C. §§ 9604-05, 9611-12;
  
   Alcan Aluminum,
  
  964 F.2d at 258. Second, CERCLA authorizes states and private parties to institute civil actions to recover the cost involved in the cleanup of hazardous wastes from those responsible for their creation, and to thereby ensure, so far as possible, that those who pollute the environment are liable for the response costs associated with cleaning it up.
  
   See
  
  42 U.S.C. § 9607(a)(1-4).
 

  Under § 9607, CERCLA liability is imposed for response costs where the plaintiff establishes the following four elements: (1) the defendant is a “responsible party”; (2) the hazardous substances were disposed of at a “facility”; (3) there is a
   
   *571
   
  “release” or threatened release of hazardous substances into the environment; and (4) the “release” causes the incurrence of “response costs.”
  
   See id.; see also Alcan Aluminum,
  
  964 F.2d at 258-59. Of these, LMC does not contest that the site meets the definition of “facility” as that term is defined by CERCLA, or that “response costs” were incurred by PADEP; however, it does challenge whether PADEP has properly pled, or, for that matter, could ever properly plead, that the other elements are present under the facts as alleged in the Amended Complaint and matters of public record. LMC also argues that as a matter of policy, CERCLA liability is inapplicable to sites decommissioned under the authority of the NRC. The court will address this latter argument first, and will then address LMC’s other grounds for dismissal.

   Applicability of CERCLA to an NRC supervised decommissioning
  


  LMC argues that PADEP’s CERCLA claim fails because CERCLA has no applicability to the decommissioning of the site pursuant to the Atomic Energy Act. It is undisputed that PADEP undertook its efforts to remedy the Sr-90 contamination as a licensee of the NRC pursuant to a decommissioning plan approved by the NRC. Indeed, the Amended Complaint acknowledges that the PADEP “has been remediating the ... Sr-90 at the site under decommissioning plans approved by the NRC and consistent with 10 C.F.R. § 70.3811.” (Doc. 3, Amend. Compl. ¶ 12.) As LMC points out in its brief in support of its motion, this admission is confirmed by the public record concerning the cleanup of radiological hazards at the site.
  
   See
  
  Commission Notice, 71 Fed.Reg. at 59,840.
 

  LMC argues, without citation to authority, that because the clean-up was a Commission supervised decommissioning that CERCLA is inapplicable. LMC’s argument finds no support in the statutory text of CERCLA or the Atomic Energy Act, and is not supported by the legislative history of either statute. CERCLA’s plain language does not limit the ability to recover costs only to those costs incurred when the state acts as an environmental regulator rather than pursuant to a decommissioning plan approved by the NRC. Instead, § 9607 broadly permits the recovery of “all costs of removal or remedial action incurred by ... a State.” 42 U.S.C. § 9607(a)(4)(A). The only limitation on the recovery of “all costs” is that the “incurrence of response costs” must has been caused by “a release or, a threatened release ... of a hazardous substance.”

  42 U.S.C. § 9607(a)(4).

  Putting aside for the time being that LMC challenges whether its handling of Sr-90 at the site constituted a “release” as that term is defined by CERCLA, there is little debate that PADEP took the actions that it did to remedy the continued presence of Sr-90 at the site, or that Sr-90 is a “hazardous substance” as that term is defined in 42 U.S.C. § 9601(14).
  
   5
  
  In its Amended Complaint, PADEP alleges that it “has incurred in excess of [ ]20 million dollars in unreimbursed response costs related to the cleanup and removal of Sr-90 contamination left behind by [LMC].” (Doc. 3, Amend. Compl. ¶ 20.) This is a sufficient factual allegation to “plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief.”
  
   Iqbal,
  
  129 S.Ct. at 1950.
 

  For its part, LMC argues that the legislative history “confirms that CERCLA was intended to be applicable
  
   only
  
  to those radiological ‘waste sites [that] do not otherwise come within section 170 of the Atomic Energy Act.’ ” (Doc. 17, Br. in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss, at 7 (emphasis and alterations in original) (citing
  
   A Legislative History
  
  at 715)).
  
   6
  
  At first blush, the passage cited by LMC appears to support its position that CERCLA was not meant to apply to waste sites regulated by the NRC under the Atomic Energy Act, but a fuller examination of that passage results in a different conclusion. Unedited, and in context, the passage cited by LMC reads as follows:
 

  Mr. HART.
 

  As you know, Colorado and several other Western States have serious problems with wastes at radium sites that have been abandoned by companies whose radium mining, milling, and processing activities produced the wastes. These sites are dangerous because they are not properly controlled or regulated and emit low-level radiation. We have found many radium waste sites scattered across Colorado — under restaurants, in empty lots where children play, near factories, and elsewhere. These sites need to be cleaned up to protect the health and safety of Colorado citizens. Ny question is this: Does the term “hazardous substance,” as defined
   
   *573
   
  in section 101(14) of this bill, include the wastes at these radium sites?
 

  Mr. STAFFORD.
 

  I will gladly assure the Senator from Colorado that if the radium
  
   waste sites do not otherwise come within section 170 of the Atomic Energy Act,
  
  and are not specified in the Uranium Mill Tailings Act, they will be eligible for funding and remedial action, subject to the other conditions of this bill.
 

  Mr. HART.
 

  I appreciate the assurances of the Senator from Vermont. I applaud his efforts in getting this legislation enacted and feel confident that it will go a long way toward removing a serious health and safety problem that has plagued Colorado and other States in which the mining, milling, and processing of radium have occurred.
 


   A Legislative History,
  
  at 715 (emphasis added).
 

  Furthermore, the very definition of “hazardous substance” that Senator Hart inquired about includes, by reference to § 102 (42 U.S.C. § 9602) of CERCLA, a list of substances, including Sr-90, that have been specifically designated by the Environmental Protection Agency as coming within the meaning of the term “hazardous substance.”
  
   See
  
  42 U.S.C. § 9601(14). Furthermore, it is clear that the back-and-forth between Senators Hart and Stafford was designed to reassure Senator Hart that certain radiological waste
  
   would be covered by CERCLA
  
  rather than excluded from coverage. Thus, the court concludes that the legislative history cited by LMC does not advance its argument that CERCLA is inapplicable to NRC decommissioned sites.
  
   7
  
  Accordingly, the court concludes that CERCLA cost recovery actions are permitted for the clean-up of NRC decommissioned sites so long as the actions otherwise meet the requirements for cost recovery imposed by CERCLA. It is to those other requirements that the court will now turn.

   Whether Sr-90 is excluded from the deÃÂ±nition of “disposal” pursuant to 42 U.S.C § 9601(29).
  


  PADEP asserts in its Amended Complaint that LMC is a responsible party under CERCLA and liable for the response costs associated with the remediation of Sr-90 contamination because it was the last user of Sr-90 at the site, it left behind Sr-90 at the site, and PADEP incurred response costs to remove Sr-90 from the site. (Doc. 3, Amend. Compl. ¶¶ 9-11, 19-20.) In contrast, LMC argues that PADEP has not alleged, nor could it, that LMC ever operated the facility at the time of a “disposal of any hazardous substance.” 42 U.S.C. § 9607(a)(2). The key to LMC’s argument lies in the definition of “disposal,” which excludes byproduct materials licensed by the NRC, such as Sr-90. Of course, if the definition were only
   
   *574
   
  that simple the court’s job would be blessedly less complicated; however, to reach the conclusion that “disposal” excludes byproduct material like Sr-90, the court is required to navigate a labyrinth no less complex than if it were constructed by Daedalus
  
   8
  
  himself.
 

  CERCLA defines “disposal” by reference to the definition of the same word in the Solid Waste Disposal Act (“SWDA”) at 42 U.S.C. § 6903(3).
  
   See
  
  42 U.S.C. § 9601(29) (“The term[ ] ‘disposal’ ... shall have the meaning provided in [42 U.S.C. § 6903(3)].”). The SWDA defines “disposal” as:
 

  The term “disposal” means the discharge, deposit, injection, dumping, spilling, leaking, or placing of any
  
   solid waste or hazardous waste
  
  into or on any land or water so that such solid waste ox-hazardous waste or any constituent thereof may enter the environment or be emitted into the air or discharged into any waters, including ground waters.
 

  42 U.S.C. § 6903(3) (emphasis added). This definition requires that one can only “dispose” of that which is “solid waste” or “hazardous waste.” The definition of “hazardous waste” is of little value, because it too incorporates the definition of “solid waste.”
  
   See
  
  42 U.S.C. § 6903(5) (The term “ ‘hazardous waste’ means a
  
   solid waste, or combination of solid wastes,
  
  which because of its quantity, concentration, or physical, chemical, or infectious characteristics may .... ” (emphasis added)). Thus, the court must look to the definition of “solid waste,” which is as follows:
 

  [A]ny garbage, refuse, sludge from a waste treatment plant, water supply treatment plant, or air pollution control facility and other discarded material, including solid, liquid, semisolid, or contained gaseous material resulting from industrial eommei'dal, mining and agx-icultural operations, and from community activities, but does not include ... source, special nuclear, or byproduct material as defined by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (68 Stat. 923) [42 U.S.C.A. § 2011
  
   et seq.l
  


  42 U.S.C. § 6903(27) (emphasis added). There is no disagreement that Sr-90 is a “byproduct material” as defined by the AEA, and the public record supports this conclusion.
  
   See
  
  Notice of Proposed Issuance of Byproduct Material License, 27 Fed.Reg. 5518 (June 8, 1962). Thus, concludes LMC, because the term “disposal” as used by CERCLA excludes Sr-90 because it is a byproduct material, it is statutorily impossible for LMC to have operated the site at the time of a “disposal of any hazardous substance”—because no “disposal” of Sr-90 can ever occur—and, therefore, LMC cannot be liable for the response costs incurred in the clean-up of Sr-90. LMC’s logic is correct, but it is not the end of the line.
 

  In its brief in opposition to LMC’s motion, PADEP correctly points out that the phrase “hazardous substance” is itself a term of art defined by CERCLA, and it just so happened to specifically
  
   include
  
  Sr-90 in its definition. CERCLA defines “hazardous substance” to include, among other things, “any element, compound, mixture, solution, or substance, designated pursuant to Section 102” of CERCLA. 42 U.S.C. § 9601(14). Pursuant to Section 102 of CERCLA—42 U.S.C. § 9602(a)—the EPA Administrator has designated a number of “hazardous substances” at 40 C.F.R. § 302.4(a), which states “[t]he elements and compounds and hazardous wastes appearing in Table 302.4 are desig
   
   *575
   
  nated as hazardous substances under Section 102(a)” of CERCLA. Sr-90 is listed in that table.
  
   See
  
  40 C.F.R. Tbl. 302.4, App. B.
 

  Thus, when reconciled, the language of the liability provisions of § 9607(a) is ambiguous because the “disposal of any hazardous substance” both
  
   excludes
  
  and
  
   includes
  
  Sr-90. One could reasonably interpret this language to make “disposal” the operative word, and because it excludes Sr-90 any handling of that substance would not give rise to CERCLA liability. On the other hand, one could determine that “hazardous substance” is the operative language because the main purpose of CERCLA is to make polluters pay for response costs, and since that phrase includes Sr-90, PADEP is not precluded from continuing its claim. Of course, it would be impermissible for the court to read either the term “disposal” or the term “hazardous substance” out of § 9607(a) (2).
  
   See Hawaii v. Office of Hawaiian Affairs,
  
  — U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1436, 1444, 173 L.Ed.2d 333 (2009) (“ ‘We must have regard to all the words used by Congress, and as far as possible give effect to them.’ ”) (quoting
  
   Louisville & Nashville R.R. Co. v. Mottley,
  
  219 U.S. 467, 475, 31 S.Ct. 265, 55 L.Ed. 297 (1911));
  
   see also Hibbs v. Winn,
  
  542 U.S. 88, 101, 124 S.Ct. 2276, 159 L.Ed.2d 172 (2004) (“[a] statute should be construed so that effect is given to all its provisions, so that no part will be inoperative or superfluous, void or insignificant .... ” (internal quotations omitted)).
 

  Of course, the maxim of giving all words of a statute their due weight is fine when a statutory phrase does not lend itself to two different conclusions, as is the case here. Nevertheless, the absence of textual clarity does not lead to judicial despair; instead, the court is charged with determining what Congress meant by the apparent ambiguity in the statutory language.
  
   See Fla. Dep’t of Revenue v. Piccadilly Cafeterias, Inc.,
  
  554 U.S. 33, 128 S.Ct. 2326, 2342, 171 L.Ed.2d 203 (2008) (Breyer, J., dissenting) (“Statutory interpretation is not a game of blind man’s bluff. Judges are free to consider statutory language in light of a statute’s basic purposes.” (citing
  
   Dole Food Co. v. Patrickson,
  
  538 U.S. 468, 484, 123 S.Ct. 1655, 155 L.Ed.2d 643 (2003) (Breyer, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part)));
  
   see also Robinson v. Shell Oil Co.,
  
  519 U.S. 337, 346, 117 S.Ct. 843, 136 L.Ed.2d 808 (1997) (the Supreme Court’s construction of a statute’s meaning based in part on its consideration of the statute’s
  
   “primary purpose”
  
  (emphasis added)).
 

  Thus, because a literal reading of CERCLA produces absurd results, the relevant inquiry is what Congress could have meant by including the definition of “disposal” that it did, and at the same time granting the Administrator of the EPA free reign to list certain substances as “hazardous substances” subject to CERCLA liability. The court begins with the premise that CERCLA is a remedial statute which should be construed liberally to effectuate its goals.
  
   U.S. v. Alcan Aluminum,
  
  964 F.2d 252, 258 (3d Cir.1992). Most significantly, in CERCLA, Congress enacted “a complex piece of legislation designed to force polluters to pay for costs associated with remedying their pollution.”
  
   Id.
  
  (citing
  
   A Legislative History
  
  at 320 (one of the statute’s principal goals is “assuring that those who caused chemical harm bear the costs of that harm.... ”)). It would seem inconsistent with this plainly stated, broad remedial purpose to totally preclude a cost recovery action for the disposal of Sr-90.
 

  While it is true that the ambiguity in the statute is the result of a conflict created by a congressionally defined term — disposal'— and an administratively defined term— hazardous substance — in the context of the
   
   *576
   
  entire statutory framework of CERCLA, the court finds this distinction immaterial. There is no way to unambiguously determine what Congress meant by the phrase “disposal of any hazardous substance” without reference to the definitions of both “disposal” and “hazardous substance.” The fact that Congress chose to give the EPA discretion to define specifically what substances constitute “hazardous substances,” means that this court can appropriately infer an implicit congressional delegation of interpretative authority of CERCLA to the EPA.
  
   See Comite Pro Rescate De La Salud v. P.R. Aqueduct and Sewer Auth.,
  
  888 F.2d 180, 186 (1st Cir.1989) (holding that ambiguity within the definitional section of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”), 42 U.S.C. § 6901 — whose definitions were incorporated by CERCLA — as well as the fact that the RCRA was part of the overall complex environmental regulatory scheme, means that the court should defer to the EPA’s application of the definitional section because the “agency is often in a better position than a court to offer a proper answer” as to the scope and construction of the statute).
 

  Here, the EPA, pursuant to the regulatory power granted by § 102 of CERCLA-42 U.S.C. § 9602—has listed over 750 radionuclides as “hazardous substances” for purposes of CERCLA.
  
   See
  
  40 C.F.R. Tbl. 302.4, App. B. Many of these radionuclides undoubtedly fall within definitions of “source, special nuclear, or byproduct material as defined by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (68 Stat. 923) [42 U.S.C.A. § 2011
  
   et
  
  seq.]” that are specifically excluded under the definition of “disposal” in CERCLA. Certainly, when creating Appendix B to § 302.4, the Administrator of the EPA was aware of the exclusion referenced by LMC but nonetheless included Sr-90—and 750 other radionuclides—on the list of hazardous substances to be subject to CERCLA liability. For purposes of resolving the ambiguity in § 9607(a)(2) of CERCLA, the court will defer to the expertise of the EPA in its interpretation of the definitional section, as the EPA “has, or will develop, the type of experience that will permit it properly to [apply]” the statute.
  
   Comite Pro Rescate De La Salud,
  
  888 F.2d at 186. After all, “the proper application of the definitional exceptions] raises the very sort of interstitial legal question, related to proper administration of a complex statutory scheme, to which an agency is often in a better position than a court to offer a proper answer.”
  
   Id.
  
  Accordingly, the court concludes that disposal of Sr-90 can indeed constitute a “disposal of any hazardous substance” for purposes of CERCLA liability pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 9607(a)(2).
 

  3.
  
   Whether PADEP has alleged a “disposal” within the meaning of CERCLA
  


  LMC argues that even if Sr-90 could be subject to “disposal” for purposes of CERCLA liability, PADEP has not alleged sufficient facts to plausibly state the LMC disposed of Sr-90 at the site. According to CERCLA, the actions that constitute “disposal” include “the discharge, deposit, injection, dumping, spilling, leaking, or placing of any solid waste or hazardous waste into or on any land or water....” 42 U.S.C. §§ 9601(29), 6903(3). In its brief, LMC cites to Paragraph 10 of PADEP’s Amended Complaint, where PA-DEP states that “[LMC] ... left behind and failed to dispose properly of some of the Sr-90 in the hot cells, piping and tanks after its ceased operations at the site.” (Doc. 3, Amend. Compl. ¶ 10.) LMC argues that this allegation is insufficient to state a cause of action under the statutory definition of disposal.
  
   (See
  
  Doc. 17, Br. in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss at 12.) Inexplica
   
   *577
   
  bly, LMC fails to point out that PADEP also alleges the following, in Paragraph 11:
 

  During the assessment, remediation and decommissioning, Sr-90 contamination was found in nearly all parts of the interconnected structure, including the hot cells, Service Area, waste water treatment building and associated drain lines, reactor bay, the inside of walls, under floor coverings of the administrative area, and in the underlying soils.
 

  (Doc. 3, Amend. Compl. ¶ 11.) These allegations are sufficient because they plausibly assert that Sr-90 was found in places that it was not supposed to be, and that LMC was the party responsible for allowing this to happen. As long as the facts alleged are sufficient to “raise a right to relief above the speculative level” such that the plaintiffs claim is “plausible on its face,” a complaint will survive a motion to dismiss.
  
   Twombly,
  
  550 U.S. at 555, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955.
  
   See also, Ashcroft v. Iqbal,
  
  — U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949 (explaining a claim has “facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged”). Moreover, the public record lends further support to the plausibility of PADEP’s factual allegations, as the NRC itself stated that “[LMC] was the last user of Sr-90 at the [site],” and that “Sr-90 had leached to the surface of the concrete resulting in contamination levels in excess of the release limits,” which “indicated that concrete thought to contain only surface contamination was volumetrically contaminated.”
  
   See
  
  Commission Notice, 71 Fed.Reg. at 59,840.
 

  Notwithstanding the facial plausibility of PADEP’s allegations, LMC argues that because it performed a partial decontamination pursuant to Commission guidelines in 1967 when it ended its work at the site, and because the license for residual Sr-90 contamination was assumed by Penn State, it could not have disposed of Sr-90 within the meaning of CERCLA. In effect, LMC’s argument is nothing more than that which it made previously: Because it possessed Sr-90 with the permission of the NRC, and transferred ownership of any residual Sr-90 through the Commission regulated licensure process, that it cannot be liable for any disposal of Sr-90 because no disposal occurred until the time of the NRC approved decommissioning performed by PADEP.
 

  The court is highly skeptical that LMC’s argument has any merit. Assuming that PADEP can demonstrate at trial that the disposal of Sr-90 occurred while LMC operated the site, unless other exceptions apply, it seems irrelevant that the site was licensed by the NRC at the time of the disposal. Certainly, LMC would have a hard time arguing that the NRC approved the leaching of Sr-90 into all of the interconnected structures at the site. The fact that other operators were “licensed” to possess the residual Sr-90 after LMC left the site is more a function of the fact that someone must be responsible for byproduct material present on the site, than an exculpatory blessing by the NRC absolving LMC of any and all liability under CERCLA or any other federal statute. The cases cited by LMC in support of its proposition are not analogous to the present situation.
 

  Both
  
   Prudential Ins. Co. v. U.S. Gypsum,
  
  711 F.Supp. 1244 (D.N.J.1989), and
  
   3550 Stevens Creek Assocs. v. Barclays Bank,
  
  915 F.2d 1355 (9th Cir.1990) address whether a CERCLA claim can be predicated on the use of asbestos-containing materials in the construction and maintenance of building structures. Both courts held that no cause of action exists under those circumstances because a “disposal” does not occur when a hazardous substance is used as intended in a building structure.
   
   *578
   

   See Prudential, supra,
  
  at 1254-55, and
  
   3550 Stevens Creek Assocs., supra,
  
  at 1360-62. It would be one thing if PADEP had alleged, and the public record supported, the premise that the Sr-90 used by LMC had “stayed put” and had not contaminated the entire interconnected structure. However, this is not the case, and unlike the structures in either
  
   Prudential
  
  or
  
   3550 Stevens Creek
  
  Assocs., both PA-DEP’s allegations and the public record indicate that the entire structure became contaminated. Thus, it is difficult for the court to see how either of the cases cited by LMC are analogous.
 

  At this stage of the proceedings, the court concludes that PADEP adequately alleged that LMC disposed of Sr-90 during its operation of the site.
  
   (See
  
  Doc. 3, Amend. Comp. ¶¶ 9-11.) This is all that is required to survive a motion to dismiss.
  
   Twombly,
  
  550 U.S. at 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955 (stating that as long as the facts alleged are sufficient to “raise a right to relief above the speculative level” such that the plaintiffs claim is “plausible on its face,” a complaint will survive a motion to dismiss). Accordingly, the court will move on to address LMC’s remaining arguments.
 

  4.
  
   “Financial Protection” and “Release”
  


  Liability attaches under CERCLA only where there is “a release, or a threatened release which causes the incurrence of response costs, of a hazardous substance.” 42 U.S.C. § 9607(a)(4).
  
   9
  
  LMC’s second line of attack concerns the definition of “release” contained in this section, which reads, in relevant part:
 

  The term “release” means any spilling, leaking, pumping, pouring, emitting, emptying, discharging, injecting, escaping, leaching, dumping, or disposing into the environment (including the abandonment or discarding of barrels, containers, and other closed receptacles containing any hazardous substance or pollutant or contaminant), but excludes ... (C) release of source, byproduct, or special nuclear material from a nuclear incident, as those terms are defined in the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 [42 U.S.C. §§ 2011 et seq.], if such release is subject to requirements with respect to financial protection established by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission under section 170 of such Act....
 

  42 U.S.C. § 9601(22) (emphasis added). This definition makes it clear that to be statutorily excluded from “releasing” a hazardous substance — and thereby, be exempt from CERCLA liability — the release must be (1) from a “nuclear incident,” and (2) “subject to requirements of financial protection” under the AEA. LMC argues that its handling of Sr-90 meets both of these requirements.
 

  First, LMC argues that the presence of residual Sr-90 contamination alleged by PADEP falls within the AEA’s definition of a “nuclear incident.” As defined by the AEA, the term “nuclear incident” means:
 

  [A]ny occurrence ... within the United States causing ... bodily injury, sickness, disease, or death, or loss of or damage to property, or loss of use of property, arising out of or resulting from the radioactive, toxic, explosive, or other hazardous properties of source, special nuclear, or byproduct material....
 

  42 U.S.C. § 2014(q) (emphasis added). In its Amended Complaint, PADEP alleges that the release of Sr-90 caused “structural contamination” to the buildings at the site, which required those structures to be “remove[d] and dispose[d].” (Doc. 3,
   
   *579
   
  Amend. Compl. ¶ 19.) Furthermore, the public record reflects that “Sr-90 had leached to the surface of the concrete resulting in ... volumetric[ ] contamination].” Commission Notice, 71 Fed.Reg. at 59,840. These allegations are sufficient to meet the statutory definition of a “nuclear incident.”
  
   See Pa. v. Gen. Pub. Utils. Corp.,
  
  710 F.2d 117, 123 (3d Cir.1983),
  
   superceded by statute on other grounds as recognized by In re TMI Litig. Cases Consol. II,
  
  940 F.2d 832, 857 (3d Cir.1991) (holding that at that preliminary stages of litigation, a claim of even “temporary loss of use of property ... irrespective of any causally-related permanent physical harm to property” is adequate to assert the occurrence of a nuclear incident).
 

  LMC also contends that it meets the second requirement for the exclusion from the definition of “release,” namely that the release was subject to the requirements of “financial protection established by the [NRC] under section 170 of the [AEA].” 42 U.S.C. § 9601(22). The AEA defines “financial protection” as simply “the ability to respond in damages for public liability and to meet the costs of investigating and defending claims and settling suits for such damages.” 42 U.S.C. § 2014(k). LMC argues that the byproducts materials license issued by the Commission in 1962 included an indemnity agreement that constitutes “financial protection” for purposes of the AEA. In support of its argument, LMC cites to the “Notice of Proposed Issuance of Byproduct Material License” reported in the Federal Register, which reads, in relevant part:
 

  [The site] will not be a “Production facility” as defined in section 11th of the [AEA]...Therefore, the publication in the Federal Register on March 21, 1961 (26 F.R. 2376), with respect to this [site], entitled, “Notice of Interim Establishment of Required Financial Protection and Indemnification Fee” should be disregarded, and neither financial protection will be required of nor will indemnity be extended to this licensee under section 170c of the [AEA]. However, there is Price-Anderson indemnity coverage under a contract between the Commission and [LMC] pursuant to section 170d of the [AEA].
 

  27 Fed.Reg. 5518 (June 6, 1962) (emphasis added). According to LMC, the indemnity coverage provided in the contract between it and the Commission pursuant to section 170d of the AEA is “financial protection” as that term is defined by the AEA because it would permit LMC to “respond in damages for public liability and to meet the costs of investigating and defending and settling suits for such damage.” 42 U.S.C. § 2014(k). Indeed, although the term “indemnification” is not defined in the AEA, its plain meaning is consistent with the meaning ascribed by Congress to the phrase “financial protection.”
  
   See
  
  Black’s Law Dictionary, 8th Ed. (2004) (defining “indemnification” as “the action of compensating for loss or damage sustained”). If this were the end of the statutory language, the court would be inclined to agree with LMC that its use of Sr-90 was subject to AEA “financial protection,” unfortunately, the AEA is not that clear.
 

  PADEP argues that whether the indemnity agreement between the Commission and LMC constitutes financial protection is a fact specific inquiry that is inappropriate for disposition on a motion to dismiss. Specifically, it argues that the face of the license, by its terms, did not require financial protection, and not all indemnity agreements between the Commission and a licensee constitute financial protection because indemnity agreements and financial protection serve two different purposes.
 

  Concerning the first argument, the court agrees that the terms of the license clearly
   
   *580
   
  indicate that financial protection is not required. The Federal Register notice clearly states that “neither financial protection will be required of nor will indemnity be extended to this licensee under section 170c of the [AEA]. However, there is Price-Anderson indemnity coverage under a contract between the Commission and Martin-Marietta pursuant to section 170d of the [AEA].” 27 Fed.Reg. 5518.
 

  PADEP’s second point also has merit. Although the parties make only a passing reference to the fact that § 2210 reads differently now than it did in 1962 when the byproduct materials license was issued by the Commission, the court believes that it makes considerably more sense to look at the 1962 version of the statute when considering what the Commission meant by its reference to sections 2210(c) and (d). In 1962, section 2210 read, in relevant part:
 

  § 2210. Indemnification and limitation of liability.
 

  (a)Financial protection for public liability claims; indemnification agreement; waiver of immunity.
 

  Each license issued under section 2133 or 2134 of this title and each construction permit issued under section 2235 of this title shall, and each license issued under section 2073, 2093, or 2111 of this title may, have as a condition of the license a requirement that the licensee have and maintain financial protection of such type and in such amounts as the Commission shall require in accordance with subsection (b) of this section to cover public liability claims. Whenever such financial protection is required, it shall be a further condition of the license that the licensee execute and maintain an indemnification agreement in accordance with subsection (c) of this section. The Commission may require, as a further condition of issuing a license that an applicant waive any immunity from public liability conferred by Federal or State law.
 

  (b) Amount and types of financial protection.
 

  The amount of financial protection required shall be the amount of liability insurance available from private sources, except that the Commission may establish a lesser amount on the basis of criteria set forth in writing, which it may revise from time to time, taking into consideration such factors as the following: (1) the cost and terms of private insurance, (2) the type, size, and location of the licensed activity and other factors pertaining to the hazard, and (3) the nature and purpose of the licensed activity:
  
   Provided,
  
  That for facilities designed for producing substantial amounts of electricity and having a rated capacity of 100,000 electrical kilowatts or more, the amount of financial protection required shall be the maximum amount available from private sources.
  
   Such financial protection may include private insurance, private contractual indemnities, self insurance, other roof of ÃÂ±nancial responsibility, or a combination of such measures.
  


  (c) Indemnification from public liability in excess of level of financial protection; aggregate indemnity.
 

  The Commission shall, with respect to licenses issued between August 30, 1954, and August 1, 1967, for which it requires financial protection, agree to indemnify and hold harmless the licensee and other persons indemnified, as their interest may appear, from public liability arising from nuclear incidents, which is in excess of the level of financial protection required of the licensee. The aggregate indemnity for all persons indemnified in connection with each nuclear incident shall not exceed $500,000,000 including
   
   *581
   
  the reasonable costs of investigating and settling claims and defending suits for damage. Such a contract of indemnification shall cover public liability arising out of or in connection with the licensed activity. With respect to any production or utilization facility for which a construction permit is issued between August 30, 1954, and August 1, 1967, the requirements of this subsection shall apply to any license issued for such facility subsequent to August 1,1967.
 

  (d) Indemnification agreements for construction or operation of production or utilization facilities, or other activities; applicability to contracts; sovereign immunity.
 

  In addition to an other authority
  
   the Commission may have, the Commission is authorized until August 1, 1967, to enter into agreements of indemnification with its contractors
  
  for the construction or operation of production or utilization facilities or other activities under contracts for the benefit of the United States involving activities under the risk of public liability for a substantial nuclear incident.
  
   In such agreements of indemnification the Commission may require its contractor to provide and maintain financial protection
  
  of such a type and in such amounts as the Commission shall determine to be appropriate to cover public liability arising out of or in connection with the contractual activity, and shall indemnify the persons indemnified against such claims above the amount of the financial protection required, in the amount of $500,000,000 including the reasonable costs of investigating and settling claims and defending suits for damage in the aggregate for all persons indemnified in connection with such contract and for each nuclear incident ....
 

  42 U.S.C. § 2210(a)-(d) (1964) (bold,- italicized, and underlined emphasis added).
  
   10
  
  It is clear from the quoted language that not all indemnity agreements constitute “financial protection” under the AEA. The notice in the Federal Register unequivocally stated that “neither financial protection will be required nor will indemnity be extended to [LMC] under [§ 2210(c) ].” 27 Fed.Reg. 5518. Instead, the Commission entered into a contract for “indemnity coverage” with LMC pursuant to § 2210(d). By its plain terms, that section read, at all relevant times, that “[i]n such agreements of indemnification the Commission
  
   may
  
  require its contractor to provide and maintain financial protection.” 42 U.S.C. § 2210(d) (1964) (emphasis added). This language paints a clear picture that while some indemnity agreements may contain financial protection guarantees, not all of them do. Otherwise, it would be superfluous for Congress to have established two separate schemes — one for financial protection and one for indemnity.
 

  The conclusion that indemnity and “financial protection” are not coextensive is bolstered in § 2210(b), which defines the amount and types of financial protection. That section unequivocally discussed financial protection in terms of “liability insurance available from private sources,” and states that “[s]uch financial protection may include private insurance, private contractual indemnities, self insurance, other proof of financial responsibility, or a combination of such measures.” 42 U.S.C. § 2210(b) (1964). Conspicuously absent from the list of types of “financial protection” is the sort of contractually provided
   
   *582
   
  public indemnity that is at issue in this case.
 

  Thus, contrary to the arguments made by LMC, the court does not find that the § 2210(d) indemnity is by default financial protection as that term is otherwise used in § 2210. Instead, this is a factual issue that is inappropriate for disposition on a motion to dismiss. The court simply does not know whether the contract between LMC and the Commission required financial protection- — -a provision that the Commission could have insisted upon in the agreement pursuant to the language of § 2210(d) — and, thus, the court cannot determine at this stage whether the “release” exemption applies to the release of Sr-90 at the site.
 

  5.
  
   “Federally permitted release”
  


  Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 9607®, “[r]ecovery by any person ... for response costs or damages resulting from a federally permitted release shall be pursuant to existing law in lieu of this section.” LMC argues that even if other “release” exemptions do not apply, the “release” of Sr-90 is nevertheless exempt from CERCLA liability because they were “federally permitted release[s]” as that term is defined by 42 U.S.C. § 9601(10)(K), which reads, in relevant part:
 

  The term “federally permitted release” means ... (K) any release of source, special nuclear, or byproduct material, as those terms are defined in the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 ... in compliance with a legally enforceable license, permit, regulation, or order issued pursuant to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954.
 

  42 U.S.C. § 9601(10)(K). LMC argues that the public record reflects that any Sr-90 that was left behind by LMC was done so in accordance with a Byproduct Material License issued by the Commission pursuant to the AEA, and cites to the following language contained in the Commission Notice found in the Federal Register: “In 1967, LMC terminated its lease for use of the hot cells after performing a partial decontamination. However, licensable quantities of Sr-90 contamination remained in the hot cells and associated facilities.” Commission Notice, 71 Fed.Reg. at 59,840. According to LMC, this notice makes clear that its “license unambiguously permitted the alleged ‘releases’ of Sr-90.” (Doc. 17, Br. in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss at 16.) The issue is not that simple.
 

  First, it bears noting that the exception LMC invokes is an affirmative defense, thus LMC, as the party claiming the defense not only has the initial burden of proof, but also the ultimate burden of proving the applicability of the exception.
  
   See In re Acushnet River & New Bedford Harbor: Proceedings re Alleged PCB Pollution,
  
  722 F.Supp. 893, 901 (D.Mass.1989);
  
   Lincoln Properties, Ltd. v. Higgins,
  
  1993 WL 217429, at *22 (E.D.Cal.1993). Moreover, if some of the harm resulted from permitted releases, and other parts of the harm from non-permitted releases, the burden is on LMC to prove that the harm is divisible.
  
   See U.S. v. Iron Mountain Mines, Inc.,
  
  812 F.Supp. 1528, 1540-41 (E.D.Cal.1992).
  
   See also In re Acushnet River & New Bedford Harbor: Proceedings re Alleged PCB Pollution,
  
  722 F.Supp. 893 (D.Mass.1989) (Summary
 

  judgment is not appropriate when there are issues of material fact as to whether alleged polluter could be held liable for cleanup costs, despite polluter’s claim that its releases were federally permitted, in that there was evidence that some of the pollution may have come from nonpermitted discharges.);
  
   Carson Harbor Village, Ltd. v. Unocal Corp.,
  
  287 F.Supp.2d 1118, 1183-84 (C.D.Cal.2003) (noting that even if defendant establishes some releases were “federally permitted,” plaintiff can recover
   
   *583
   
  if “non-federally permitted” releases contributed to the injury).
 

  Second, as argued by PADEP, the term “federally permitted release” was defined by Congress in relation to and “in compliance with a legally enforceable license.” 42 U.S.C. § 9601(10)(K). Given the explicitness and clarity of this definition, it is apparent that in order to determine whether the release of Sr-90 by LMC was “in compliance” with its license, the court must examine both the license itself and the extent of the release. While the court is aware that the license at issue is not like a disposal license where one could easily compare how much the licensee was authorized to dispose versus how much was actually disposed; the scope of the license is relevant to determine whether LMC’s handling of Sr-90 at the site was consistent with its licensed activity. Both the Amended Complaint and the public record reflect that Sr-90 contaminated the entire site and leached places that it was never intended to be such that some of the concrete structures at the site were “volumetrieally contaminated.”
  
   See
  
  Commission Notice, 71 Fed.Reg. at 59,840.
 

  The fact that the Commission may have authorized LMC to leave behind some Sr-90 does not mean that it authorized the later release of that substance. At this stage of the proceedings the court is permitted only to review PADEP’s allegations, “exhibits attached to the complaint and matters of public record.”
  
   Pension Benefit Guar. Corp. v. White Consol. Indus., Inc.,
  
  998 F.2d 1192, 1196 (3d Cir.1993) (citations omitted). While the public record in this matter is voluminous and detailed, it does not answer the ultimate question whether all of the releases of Sr-90 were “in compliance with” LMC’s byproduct materials license. If they were, and LMC can demonstrate this at trial — or on summary judgment if there is no dispute about the nature and scope of the release or the scope of LMC’s license— then LMC is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on this exception. At this stage, however, there are factual questions which preclude ruling in LMC’s favor on the validity of this exception.

   Summary of CERCLA Conclusions
  


  In Part III.A.1, above, the court concluded that CERCLA cost recovery actions are permitted for the clean-up of NRC decommissioned sites so long as the actions otherwise meet all of the requirements for cost recovery imposed by CERCLA. In Parts III.A.2 and 3, above, the court concluded that disposal of Sr-90 can indeed constitute a “disposal of any hazardous substance” for purposes of CERCLA liability pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 9607(a)(2), and that PADEP adequately alleged that LMC “disposed” of Sr-90 during its operation of the site. In Part III. A.4, above, the court concluded that it could not determine at this stage of the proceedings whether the “release” exemption found in 42 U.S.C. § 9601(22) applied to the release of Sr-90 at the site because there is a factual dispute as to whether the contract between LMC and the Commission required financial protection — a provision that the Commission could have insisted upon in the agreement pursuant to the language of § 2210(d). Finally, in Part III.A.5, above, the court concluded that it could not determine at this stage of the proceedings — based solely on the amended complaint and the matters of public record — whether the release of Sr-90 at the site was “in compliance with” the byproduct materials license held by LMC, and thus, subject to the exclusion of CERCLA liability for “federally permitted releases.” For all of these reasons, the court will deny LMC’s motion to dismiss PADEP’s CERCLA claims.

  B.
  
   State Law Claims
  


  In addition to federal claims under CERCLA, PADEP seeks to recover its response costs for remedying the Sr-90 contamination under a host of state statutory and common law claims. Specifically, PADEP seeks to recover under the Hazardous Sites Cleanup Act (“HSCA”), 35 P.S. §§ 6020.101-6020.1305; the Solid Waste Management Act (“SWMA”), 35 P.S. §§ 6018.101-6018.1003; the Clean Streams Law (“CSL”), 35 P.S. §§ 691.1-691.1001; and under a theory of common law nuisance pursuant to Section 1917-A of the Administrative Code of 1929, 71 P.S. § 510-17. LMC argues that each of these claims is preempted by the Atomic Energy Act’s pervasive federal licensing scheme controlling the use and disposal of radioactive materials.
 

  “It is well established that within Constitutional limits Congress may preempt state authority by so stating in express terms.”
  
   See Pac. Gas and Elec. Co. v. State Energy Res. Conservation & Dev. Comm’n,
  
  461 U.S. 190, 203, 103 S.Ct. 1713, 75 L.Ed.2d 752 (1983) (citations omitted). Here, there is no express preemption language contained in the AEA. Absent express preemption, there can be implied preemption where the “scheme of federal regulation [is] so pervasive as to make reasonable the inference that Congress left no room to supplement it,” or, in the absence of complete displacement of state regulation, state law is preempted if it “stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.”
  
   Id.
  
  at 204, 103 S.Ct. 1713 (citations omitted). Put another way, the test for whether a specific state cause of action is preempted “is whether ‘the matter on which the state asserts the right to act is in any way regulated by the federal government.’ ”

   Supreme Court Cases
  


  Since the enactment of the AEA in 1959, the Supreme Court has addressed its preemptive effect in three decisions:
  
   Pacific Gas, supra; Silkwood v. Kerr-McGee,
  
  464 U.S. 238, 104 S.Ct. 615, 78 L.Ed.2d 443 (1984); and
  
   English v. Gen. Elec. Co.,
  
  496 U.S. 72, 110 S.Ct. 2270, 110 L.Ed.2d 65 (1990).
 

  In
  
   Pacific Gas,
  
  utility companies brought suit against the State of California to enjoin the enforcement of a state statute that imposed a moratorium on the construction of new nuclear power plants in the state until adequate storage and disposal methods became available for nuclear waste. The Supreme Court held the Atomic Energy Act preempted the field in terms of the “radiological safety aspects involved in the construction and operation of [nuclear facilities].”
  
   Id.
  
  at 205, 103 S.Ct. 1713. However, the Court stated that the AEA’s preemption of state law was limited: “[T]he federal government has occupied the entire field of nuclear safety concerns, except the limited powers expressly ceded to the states.”
  
   Id.
  
  at 212, 103 S.Ct. 1713. Those powers ceded to the states include those ceded by the Commission under the Price-Anderson Amendments, the regulation of radioactive air pollutants pursuant to the Clean Air Act amendments, and certain siting and land use requirements for nuclear plants.
  
   See id.,
  
  at 212-13 n. 25,103 S.Ct. 1713.
 

  Ultimately, the Court determined that Congress intended for the states to continue to make economic decisions. The Court determined that the “avowed” purpose of the California statute was economic in nature, this it was not within the preempted field, and that “the states retained the power to determine whether it made eco
   
   *585
   
  nomic sense to build a nuclear power plant.”
  
   Missouri v. Westinghouse Elec., LLC,
  
  487 F.Supp.2d 1076, 1084 (E.D.Mo.2007) (citing
  
   Pac. Gas.,
  
  461 U.S. at 223, 103 S.Ct. 1713).
 

  In
  
   Silkwood,
  
  464 U.S. 238, 104 S.Ct. 615, the Supreme Court addressed whether punitive damages could be awarded in a tort action for injuries caused by radiological contamination at a NRC licensed nuclear facility. The Court examined the legislative history of the AEA, and found “ample evidence that Congress had no intention of forbidding the states from providing [remedies for those suffering injuries from radiological exposure].”
  
   Id.
  
  at 251, 104 S.Ct. 615. Ultimately, the Court decided that state punitive damages awards were not preempted, and explained as follows:
 

  [I]t is clear that in enacting and amending the [AEA], Congress assumed that state-law remedies, in whatever form they might take, were available to those injured by nuclear incidents. This was so even though it was well aware of the NRC’s exclusive authority to regulate safety matters. No doubt there is tension between the conclusion that safety regulation is the exclusive concern of the federal law and the conclusion that a state may nevertheless award damages based on its own law of liability. But as we understand what was done over the years in the legislation concerning nuclear energy, Congress intended to stand by both concepts and to tolerate whatever tension there was between them. We can do no less. It may be that the award of damages based on the state law of negligence or strict liability is regulatory in the sense that a nuclear plant will be threatened with damages liability if it does not conform to state standards, but that regulatory consequence was something that Congress was quite willing to accept.
 

  We do not suggest that there could never be an instance in which the federal law would preempt the recovery of damages based on state law. But insofar as damages for radiation injuries are concerned, preemption should not be judged on the basis that the federal government has so completely occupied the field of safety that state remedies are foreclosed but on whether there is an irreconcilable conflict between the federal and state standards or whether the imposition of a state standard in a damages action would frustrate the objectives of the federal law. We perceive no such conflict or frustration in the circumstances of this case.
 


   Id.
  
  at 256, 104 S.Ct. 615 (emphasis added).
 

  The third Supreme Court case to address this issue was
  
   English v. General Elec. Co.,
  
  496 U.S. 72, 110 S.Ct. 2270, 110 L.Ed.2d 65 (1990). In that case, an employee of a nuclear-fuel production facility brought suit against her employer, claiming that the employer took retaliatory action after she made nuclear safety complaints. The question before the court was whether federal law preempted a state cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress. The Court held that the state law claim did “not fall within the pre-empted field of nuclear safety,”
  
   id.
  
  at 90, 110 S.Ct. 2270, and did not conflict with the provision of the AEA that encouraged employees to report safety violations and established a procedure to protect them from any resulting retaliation.
  
   Id.
  
  at 82, 110 S.Ct. 2270. In so doing, the Court found that “not every state law that in some remote way may affect the nuclear safety decisions made by those who build and run nuclear facilities can be said to fall within the pre-empted field.”
  
   Id.
  
  at 79, 110 S.Ct. 2270. Instead, for a state law to be pre-empted, “it must have some direct and substantial effect on the decisions made by those who build or operate nuclear facilities concerning radiological safety levels.”
  
   Id.
  


 
   *586
   
  To summarize, the Supreme Court has unequivocally stated that the federal government occupies the field of nuclear safety entirely, and this field preemption is all encompassing where that state statute at issue involves nuclear safety. In other words, if a state statute “was enacted with the purpose of protecting against radiation hazards, or if state regulation directly affected radiological safety regardless of the regulation’s purposes” it is preempted.
  
   Missouri v. Westinghouse Elec., LLC,
  
  487 F.Supp.2d 1076, 1085 (E.D.Mo.2007) (citing
  
   English,
  
  496 U.S. at 79, 110 S.Ct. 2270.) However, where nuclear safety is not directly affected by the state statute, it is preempted only if “there is an irreconcilable conflict between the federal and state standards or whether the imposition of a state standard in a damages action would frustrate the objectives of the federal law,”
  
   Silkwood,
  
  464 U.S. at 256, 104 S.Ct. 615, or where there is “some direct and substantial effect on the decisions made by those who build or operate nuclear facilities concerning radiological safety levels.”
  
   English,
  
  496 U.S. at 79, 110 S.Ct. 2270.
 

  Thus, the question in this case is whether the state claims brought by PADEP directly involve nuclear safety concerns, if so they are preempted. If they do not, then the court must determine whether they bear a direct and substantial effect on the decisions made by those who run nuclear facilities and/or whether there are irreconcilable conflicts between them and the AEA.
 

  2.
  
   PADEP’s state law claims
  


  LMC argues that each of the Pennsylvania state law claims infringe upon the preempted field of nuclear safety, and it cites to the declaration of policy with respect to each statute. It is true that each of the state statutes upon which PADEP’s claims rest appear to have been enacted to address public health and welfare.
  
   See
  
  35 P.S. § 6020.102(2), (5) (stating that the HSCA (Count II) was intended to address contaminated sites that “pose a real and substantial threat to the public health and welfare.”); 35 P.S. § 6018,102(4) (stating that the purpose of SWMA (Count III) was “to ... protect the public health, safety and welfare from the short and long term dangers of transportation, processing, treatment, storage, and disposal of all wastes.”); and 35 P.S. § 691.4(3) (stating that it was the object of the Clean Streams Law (Count IV) to “prevent further pollution of the waters of the Commonwealth ... [and] ... to restore to a clean, unpolluted condition every stream in Pennsylvania that is presently polluted[.]”).
 

  LMC argues that the state laws in question are analogous to those that the state of Missouri sought to enforce in
  
   Missouri v. Westinghouse Elec., LLC,
  
  487 F.Supp.2d 1076 (E.D.Mo.2007). That ease involved the cleanup of environmental contamination at the Hematite Nuclear Facility that was owned by Westinghouse.
  
   Id.
  
  at 1078. The Hematite site had operated as a nuclear fuel processing plant for almost forty years, and was contaminated with radiological and chemical wastes. In 2000, shortly after it acquired the site, Westinghouse began to decommission the facility under the supervision of the NRC.
  
   Id.
  


  The state of Missouri filed suit under section 107 of CERCLA, the Missouri Hazardous Waste Management Law, and the Missouri Clean Water Law.
  
   See id.
  
  In the complaint, Missouri sought injunctive relief, requiring that Westinghouse perform a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (RI/FS) to determine the nature and extent of the contamination and develop a plan to decontaminate the area.
  
   Id.
  
  Missouri also demanded that Westinghouse implement the remedy selected through the RI/FS process and reimburse the state for past or future response costs incurred at the site.
  
   Id.
  
  In May of 2006,
   
   *587
   
  Missouri and Westinghouse entered into a Consent Decree and submitted it to the district court for approval. The Consent Decree sought reimbursement for all response costs, but also required Westinghouse to remediate the site under the supervision of the Missouri Department of Natural Resources (“MDNR”), which would have been given the authority to “halt, conduct or direct any action required by [the] Consent Decree, or to direct any other response action undertaken by MDNR or [Westinghouse] at the Site.”
  
   Id.
  
  at 1080 (internal citations omitted). The United States and other corporate entities intervened in the case, and objected to approval of the Consent Decree because Missouri sought “to regulate the safety of radiological materials.”
  
   Id.
  


  The district court first concluded that the Consent Decree was unenforceable under section 107 of CERCLA because that section only permits a state to recover the costs incurred in remedial action, it does not give the state the authority to engage in or compel a responsible party to take any specific remedial action.
  
   Id.
  
  at 1081. Only the President of the United States, pursuant to sections 104 and 106 of CERCLA, is given the authority to take necessary action to control the release and decontamination of a polluted area, including the power to permit a responsible private party to conduct an RI/FS.
  
   Id.
  
  Thus, the district court concluded that there was no federal basis for Missouri’s regulatory action, and the Consent Decree was salvageable only if state law provided such authority.
 

  After a thorough analysis of the Supreme Court’s preemption cases, the district court concluded that the Consent Decree was “an attempt to regulate the safety of nuclear contaminants,” and that it was therefore preempted by the AEA “[u]nder the test espoused in
  
   Pacific Gas.” Id.
  
  at 1085. The district court rested its determination on the fact that the Consent Decree “squarely addresses the State’s health and safety concerns from radiological contamination.”
  
   Id.
  
  at 1088.
 

  The court finds
  
   Westinghouse
  
  distinguishable. Unlike the Consent Decree in
  
   Westinghouse,
  
  the state statutes at issue in this case, despite their broad statements of policy, do not directly involve nuclear safety concerns. While the purpose of the state statutes in question bear generally on the issue of public safety, they do not address the use, disposal, or manner of remediation of radiological waste, and do not impose additional burdens upon radiological safety than those already imposed by the AEA. The AEA “does not impair [s]tate authority to regulate activities of [NRC] licensees for the manifold health, safety, and economic purposes other than radiation protection.”

Even a cursory review of the state statutes in question reveals that they are directed at safety concerns generally, and not at radiological safety, and, thus, are not covered by the AEA’s field preemption. Here, unlike the State of Missouri in
  
   Westinghouse,
  
  PADEP is not seeking to monitor, control, impose remediation standards or otherwise dictate how the site is remediated; rather, it only seeks reimbursement for the costs incurred in performing a federally-required clean up. This clean
   
   *588
   
  up was conducted under the authority of the NRC through its decommissioning process, not pursuant to any of the statutes in question.
 

  Since nuclear safety is not directly affected by the state statutes in question, they are preempted only if “there is an irreconcilable conflict between the federal and state standards or whether the imposition of a state standard in a damages action would frustrate the objectives of the federal law,”
  
   Silkwood,
  
  464 U.S. at 256, 104 S.Ct. 615, or where there is “some direct and substantial effect on the decisions made by those who build or operate nuclear facilities concerning radiological safety levels.”
  
   English,
  
  496 U.S. at 79, 110 S.Ct. 2270. The court does not believe that either of these bases for preemption are applicable here.
 

  First, PADEP is not seeking to enforce any state standards on the remediation of the site. As stated previously, and as is averred in the Amended Complaint, the site was remediated pursuant to an NRC authorized decommissioning.
  
   (See
  
  Doc. 3, Amend. Compl. ¶ 15.) The AEA is silent on the issue of cost recovery, and this action was brought simply for the recovery of those costs incurred for the remediation. The authority to recoup the costs comes from CERCLA, as well as each of the state causes of action asserted by PADEP. Nothing in the statutes themselves or in the nature of the causes of action brought by PADEP possess an irreconcilable conflict that would frustrate the objectives of federal law.
 

  Second, the court does not believe that allowing the state causes of action to proceed would cause a direct or substantial effect on the decisions made by LMC or others who operate nuclear facilities concerning radiological safety levels. This case is about reimbursement of money spent, not the regulation of radiological hazards. The Supreme Count in
  
   Silkwood
  
  acknowledged “a tension between the conclusion that safety regulation is the exclusive concern of federal law and the conclusion that a state may nevertheless award damages based on its own law of liability,” but ultimately concluded that “Congress intended to stand by both concepts and ... tolerate whatever tension there was between them.”
  
   Silkwood,
  
  464 U.S. at 256, 104 S.Ct. 615. The Court concluded that “[i]t may be that the award of damages based on [state law] is regulatory in the sense that a nuclear [facility] will be threatened with damages liability if it does not conform to state standards, but that regulatory consequence was something that Congress was quite willing to accept.”
  
   Id.
  
  Since the court perceives no conflict with or frustration of the objectives of the AEA by permitting PADEP’s state causes of action to proceed, the court concludes that these causes of action are not preempted.
 

  IV.
  
   Conclusion
  


  For the reasons listed above, PADEP’s CERCLA action is well pled and permissible notwithstanding the fact that the site was decommissioned pursuant to NRC authority. Moreover, the court finds that PADEP’s state law causes of action are not preempted by the Atomic Energy Act. Accordingly, the court will deny Defendant LMC’s motion to dismiss and will issue an order consistent with this memorandum.

   . As the Third Circuit has observed, ''CERCLA was passed in great haste during the waning days of the 96th Congress. As a result, the statute is riddled with inconsistencies and redundancies.”
   
    Alcan Aluminum,
   
   964 F.2d at 258 n. 5. This court would add that the statute was carelessly drafted as well. One area of apparent carelessness is section § 9607(a), which is the section of CERCLA that imposes liability for the incurrence of response costs. That section reads, in relevant part:
  

   Notwithstanding any other provision or rule of law, and subject only to the defenses set forth in subsection (b) of this section — Ã¢ÂÂ 
  

   (1)the owner and operator of a vessel or a facility,
  

   (2) any person who at the time of disposal of any hazardous substance owned or operated any facility at which such hazardous substances were disposed of,
  

   (3) any person who by contract, agreement, or otherwise arranged for disposal or treatment, or arranged with a transporter for transport for disposal or treatment, of hazardous substances owned or possessed by such person, by any other party or entity, at any facility or incineration vessel owned or operated by another party or entity and containing such hazardous substances, and
  

   (4) any person who accepts or accepted any hazardous substances for transport to disposal or treatment facilities, incineration vessels or sites selected by such person,
   
    from which there is a release, or a threatened
   
 
    *572
    

    release which causes the incurrence of response costs, of a hazardous substance,
   
   shall be liable for—
  

   (A) all costs of removal or remedial action incurred by the United States Government or a State or an Indian tribe not inconsistent with the national contingency plan;
  

   (B) any other necessary costs of response incurred by any other person consistent with the national contingency plan;
  

   (C) damages for injury to, destruction of, or loss of natural resources, including the reasonable costs of assessing such injury, destruction, or loss resulting from such a release; and
  

   (D) the costs of any health assessment or health effects study carried out under section [9604(1) ].
  

   42 U.S.C. § 9607(a) (emphasis added). As courts have observed, including the Third Circuit, Congress intended the italicized language to relate not only to § 9607(a)(4), but also to § 9607(a) (1-3), but apparently grossly misdrafted the language.

   Memorandum of Understanding between EPA and NRC, 67 Fed.Reg. 65,375 (Oct. 24, 2002).

    Id.
   
   at 65376. The MOU is silent about the cost recovery aspects of CERCLA, and does not limit (or expand) the scope of those actions — like this one — which are brought pursuant to § 9607(a). Put simply, there is nothing in the MOU that leads the court to conclude that Congress intended CERCLA’s cost recovery provisions to be inapplicable to sites decommissioned under the authority of the NRC. Moreover, as the MOU itself acknowledges, ”[s]tates are not signatories to this MOU....”

  The appellants in these combined appeals were jointly tried and convicted by a jury on various counts of a twelve-count indictment charging them with conspiracy to burglarize United States Post Offices, burglary of two Post Offices and the interstate transportation of goods stolen from three Post Offices.
 

 
   *907
   
  Six defendants were originally indicted, but only five were jointly tried below and only three of the five have appealed their convictions. The sixth defendant, William Kenneth Knight, plead guilty to the charges at Tampa, Florida, and later testified as a witness for the government at the appellants’ trial. Based largely on Knight’s testimony, the government’s evidence established that Knight, along with appellants Grogan and Pegram, burglarized Post Offices in Lexington and Saulsbury, Tennessee; that Knight and appellant Pegram burglarized a Post Office in New Albany, Mississippi and transported the fruits of the crime to Decaturville, Tennessee. They were there turned over to appellant Conder, who transported them to Chicago, Illinois; and that appellant Grogan disposed of the postage stamps stolen from each of the Post Offices in Chicago, Illinois.
 

  Most of the issues raised in these appeals concern all three appellants, although the individual appellants have stressed some issues more strongly than others. In addition, appellants Grogan and Pegram have raised issues which concern only them. We will turn first to these individual issues.
 

  I. APPELLANT GROGAN’S RIGHT TO DEFEND PRO SE.
 

  Appellant Grogan contends that the District Court committed reversible error in refusing to permit him to conduct his defense
  
   pro se.
  
  In particular Grogan, who refused this Court’s offer to appoint counsel on appeal, contends in his brief that the District Court erred by refusing to permit him to enter objections or cross-examine witnesses during the course of the trial.
 

  The record shows that upon the initial arraignment of all the defendants Grogan informed the District Court that he wished to represent himself and that he did not wish to have counsel appointed to represent him. The District Court acknowledged Grogan’s right to proceed
  
   pro se,
  
  but after fully explaining his rights to him, urged him to accept appointed counsel. Grogan again declined counsel. However, some weeks later, after he had complained to the District Court of not having the proper books and facilities to prepare certain motions which he wished to file, the District Court appointed counsel to assist Grogan. At the time of the appointment the Court again acknowledged Grogan’s right to proceed
  
   pro se
  
  and made it clear that the appointed counsel was not to force himself on Grogan. Grogan acquiesced to the appointment, and, as will be more fully discussed below, availed himself of appointed counsel’s assistance. During the period of approximately six months prior to trial, numerous motions were filed on Grogan’s behalf. While it appears that Grogan may have prepared and argued at least some of these motions, all of the motions were signed and filed by Grogan’s appointed counsel. More significantly, when the trial commenced Grogan’s counsel, along with the attorneys for the four other defendants, participated in the selection of the jury, made an opening statement and conducted cross-examination of the first nine prosecution witnesses. Grogan made no objection to counsel’s performance of any of these activities, but on the second day of trial, just before the government’s chief witness, co-defendant Knight, was about to testify, Grogan’s counsel informed the Court that Grogan wished to participate in his own defense by making objections to the admissibility of evidence. The District Court ruled, however that Grogan would not be permitted to object personally to the admissibility of evidence, and it is this ruling to which Grogan objects.
 

  While not as often the subject of litigation, the right of a defendant in a criminal case to defend
  
   pro se
  
  is as clearly established as a criminal defendant’s right to counsel.
  
   See, e. g.,
  
  Carter v. Illinois, 329 U.S. 173, 174, 67 S.Ct. 216, 91 L.Ed. 172 (1946); Adams v. United States ex rel. McCann, 317 U.S. 269, 279, 63 S.Ct. 236, 87 L.Ed. 268 (1942); Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458, 468-469, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461 (1938); United
   
   *908
   
  States v. Burkeen, 355 F.2d 241, 245 (6th Cir.),
  
   cert. denied,
  
  Matlock v. United States, 384 U.S. 957, 86 S.Ct. 1582, 16 L.Ed.2d 553 (1966); United States v. Johnson, 333 F.2d 1004, 1005 (6th Cir. 1964). The right to defend
  
   pro se
  
  and the right to counsel have been aptly described as “two faces of the same coin,” United States v. Plattner, 330 F.2d 271, 276 (2d Cir. 1964), in that the waiver of one right constitutes a correlative assertion of the other. While it may be within the discretion of a District Court to permit both a criminal defendant and his attorney to conduct different phases of the defense in a criminal trial, see United States v. Burkeen,
  
   supra,
  
  for purposes of determining whether there has been a deprivation of constitutional rights a criminal defendant cannot logically waive or assert both rights. The defendant must make a choice, and he should not be permitted to manipulate his choice so that he can claim reversible error on appeal no matter which alternative he apparently chose in the District Court.
  
   See
  
  United States v. Plattner,
  
   supra,
  
  330 F.2d at 276.
 

  In this case by accepting counsel’s assistance during the long pretrial period and by accepting counsel’s representation during the early stages of the trial, Grogan clearly manifested an intent to be represented by counsel rather than to proceed entirely
  
   pro se.
  
  When counsel informed the Court that Grogan wished to personally enter objections, the District Court ruled only “at this time that Mr. Grogan will not be permitted to make objections during the course of the direct testimony.” The Court made it clear at the time of this ruling that consideration would be given to any further application by Grogan for permission to participate in his own defense, but no such further application was made, nor did Grogan request that his counsel be discharged or that he be permitted to proceed entirely
  
   pro se.
  
  In this regard it is important to note that although Grogan argues that the District Court also denied him the right to personally conduct the cross-examination of witnesses, our examination of the record discloses no instance where Grogan made or the District Court denied any request that he be permitted to personally cross-examine the witnesses avainst him.
 

  Finally, the record shows that the denial of the request for permission to enter objections to evidence was not made without recognition of Grogan’s right and his original desire to conduct his own defense. To the contrary, the record shows that the Court’s purpose in making the ruling was to maintain the orderly conduct of the jury trial then in progress, a matter clearly within its discretion.
  
   See, e. g.,
  
  Batsell v. United States, 403 F.2d 395, 401 (8th Cir. 1968),
  
   cert. denied,
  
  393 U.S. 1094, 89 S.Ct. 865, 21 L.Ed.2d 785 (1969); Sanchez v. United States, 311 F.2d 327, 333 (9th Cir. 1962),
  
   cert. denied,
  
  373 U.S. 949, 83 S.Ct. 1678, 10 L.Ed.2d 704 (1963); Brasier v. Jeary, 256 F.2d 474, 478 (8th Cir.),
  
   cert. denied,
  
  358 U.S. 867, 79 S.Ct. 97, 3 L.Ed.2d 99 (1958). In this case five defendants were being jointly tried under a twelve-count indictment involving a rather complicated factual pattern. Each of the five defendants was represented by a separate attorney. Under these circumstances the District Court’s concern that granting permission to Grogan or any of the other defendants to personally enter objections to evidence would only serve to confuse an already complicated trial seems well founded.
 

  We therefore conclude in light of all the circumstances including Grogan’s acceptance of representation by counsel that the District Court’s denial of Grogan’s request for permission to personally enter objections to the admissibility of evidence had neither the purpose nor the effect of violating Grogan’s constitutional rights in the premises.
 

  II. APPELLANT PEGRAM’S RIGHT TO SECURE THE ATTENDANCE OF WITNESSES AT THE TRIAL.
 

  The other issue affecting only one of the appellants is whether the District Court committed error in denying appel
   
   *909
   
  lant Pegram’s petition for the issuance of subpoenas and writs of habeas corpus ad testificandum at government expense pursuant to Rule 17(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure for five persons, all of whom were incarcerated in either federal or state penal institutions.
 

  In his petition Pegram stated that “these witnesses are necessary to his defense in this case in that their testimony will be used for alibi as well as impeachment purposes” along with an allegation that he was without funds to pay the costs of securing the attendance of the witnesses. The District Court denied the petition for failure to state with sufficient particularity the nature of the testimony sought from the witnesses.
 

  Rule 17(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, 18 U.S.C., authorizes the District Court to order the issuance of subpoenas and secure the attendance of witnesses without cost for defendants who are unable to pay the necessary fees “ * * * upon a satisfactory showing * * * that the presence of the witness is necessary to an adequate defense.” The inclusion of the requirement of a “satisfactory showing” to the District Court has been held to vest the District Court with a broad discretion in granting or denying petitions under Rule 17(b).
  
   See
  
  Welsh v. United States, 404 F.2d 414, 417 (5th Cir. 1968); Findley v. United States, 380 F.2d 752, 754 (10th Cir. 1967).
 

  Here it is clear that the District Court committed no abuse of discretion in denying appellant Pegram’s application for the subpoenas and the writs. The mere allegation that the witnesses would be necessary for “alibi as well as impeachment purposes” is the most general of statements and does not constitute the sufficient averment of facts to constitute a “substantial showing” that the witnesses would be necessary to the presentation of an adequate defense.
  
   See
  
  Findley v. United States,
  
   supra.
  


  III. PRETRIAL DISCOVERY MOTIONS.
 

  The first issue which affects each of the appellants concerns the correctness of the District Court’s rulings on certain pretrial discovery motions.
 

  The first motion for discovery, filed approximately one month after the arraignment of all the appellants, requested permission to inspect and copy certain records and documents obtained by the government in the investigation of the case. The District Court granted part of the request and denied part, but the appellants have raised no issue on appeal concerning the correctness of the denial of part of the first motion. Our review of the record discloses no error in the Court’s ruling on this first motion.
 

  Approximately one month thereafter appellant Condor filed a motion for production of “all evidence of every kind and character which will be favorable to this accused in the trial of this case.” Among other things the motion requested all evidence tending to impeach or discredit the testimony of William Kenneth Knight and specifically requested all evidence of any leniency promised to Knight in exchange for his testimony. The motion also requested the government to state where and when Knight could be interviewed by counsel for defendants. The final branch in the motion requested that “the entire file of the government in this case be made available to counsel for this defendant.” The Court denied all the requested information except the request for an opportunity to interview codefendant Knight.
 

  Pursuant to the Court’s ruling the government made Knight available for an interview by counsel for all of the other defendants. It appears, however, that the attempt to interview Knight was unsuccessful because Knight, upon the advice of his attorney, refused to talk to counsel for the other defendants. After the attempt to interview Knight failed all-of the defendants joined in a new motion for discovery, including certain interrogatories directed to the
   
   *910
   
  government. Without enumerating each of the requests for information, it is sufficient to state that the main thrust of the motion again was to obtain all evidence favorable to the defendants and especially evidence which would impeach codefendant Knight.
 

  It is the denial of these latter discovery motions which the appellants claim as error, but for the reasons set forth below we hold that the District Court committed no error in this regard.
 

  First, some of the information sought was clearly not discoverable under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Rule 16(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, 18 U.S.C., permits a defendant, upon a proper showing of materiality to the preparation of his defense and reasonableness of the request, to inspect and copy books, papers, documents, tangible objects, buildings or places, which are in the possession of the government. By its very terms Rule 16(b) is limited to inspection and copying of tangible objects. Clearly therefore, the interrogatories filed by the defendants here were not an appropriate mode of discovery under Rule 16(b).
  
   See
  
  1 Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure: Criminal § 254 (1969). Similarly, the names and criminal records of government witnesses are not discoverable under Rule 16(b).
  
   See, e. g.,
  
  Hemphill v. United States, 392 F.2d 45, 48 (8th Cir.),
  
   cert. denied,
  
  393 U.S. 877 (1968); United States v. Birrell, 276 F.Supp. 798, 826 (S.D.N.Y.1967); United States v. Cobb, 271 F.Supp. 159, 162 (S.D.N.Y.1967); United States v. Margeson, 261 F.Supp. 628, 629 (E.D.Pa.1966).
 

  Second, the requirement of Rule 16(b) of a showing of the reasonableness and materiality of the request is not satisfied by a mere conclusory allegation that the requested information is material to the preparation of the defense. United States v. Birrell,
  
   supra,
  
  276 F.Supp. at 825-826; United States v. Cobb,
  
   supra,
  
  271 F.Supp. at 161-162; United States v. Soyka, 265 F.Supp. 126, 129 (S.D.N.Y.1967),
  
   reversed on other grounds,
  
  394 F.2d 443 (2d Cir. 1968). Here, except for the request to examine any statement given the government by codefendant Knight, the appellants offered nothing to the District Court other than the bare allegation that the requested information would be material to the preparation of the defense. With respect to the appellant’s request to examine any statement given to the government by Knight, the appellants showed that they had attempted to interview Knight but that Knight had refused to talk to them. Appellants also showed that they expected Knight to testify for the government at the trial and that they expected Knight’s testimony to be an important part of the government’s evidence against them at the trial. Appellants alleged that they therefore needed advance knowledge of Knight's testimony in order to prepare their defense. However, appellant’s recognition of the fact that Knight was to testify as a government witness was alone sufficient grounds for the District Court to deny discovery of his statements since Rule 16(b) specifically exempts from pretrial discovery the statements of government witnesses. And since the appellants made no showing of the reasonableness or materiality of the other requests, the District Court committed no abuse of discretion in denying them.
 

  Finally, it should be noted that while Rule 16(f) requires all motions for discovery to be made within 10 days after arraignment and further provides that the motion shall contain all the relief sought and that subsequent motions will be permitted only upon a showing of cause why such motion is in the interest of justice, none of the motions here were filed within 10 days of the arraignment nor was there any attempt to show why the subsequent motions were in the interest of justice. The failure to comply with the requirements of Rule 16(f) alone might not always be determinative of a defendant’s right to discovery, but the appellants’ utter failure to comply with the time requirements of the Rule here would justify the District Court’s
   
   *911
   
  denial of the motions as a proper exercise of discretion.
 

  Appellants also contend that an additional burden of disclosure of all evidence favorable to them was placed on the government by the Constitutional requirement of due process, as enunciated by Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), but our reading of that case discloses no such additional burden.
  
   Brady
  
  holds only that the suppression at trial of evidence favorable to an accused is a denial of due process. This is a far cry from requiring the government to determine prior to trial what evidence in its files will be favorable to the accused, a crystal-ball type decison which might often be impossible without advance knowledge of the nature of the defense which will be presented at trial.
  
   See
  
  United States v. Cobb,
  
   supra,
  
  271 F.Supp. at 163. We are therefore of the view that the disclosure required by Rule 16 is much broader than that required by the due process standards of
  
   Brady. See
  
  1 Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure: Criminal § 254 (1969). Since we have already determined that the denial of the discovery motions was not an abuse of discretion granted to the District Court under Rule 16, and since the appellants have not offered the slightest hint that the government actually suppressed any exculpatory evidence at the trial, we hold that the denial of the broad discovery motions for all evidence favorable to the appellants was not a denial of due process.
  
   See
  
  Hemphill v. United States,
  
   supra,
  
  392 F.2d at 48.
 

  IV. THE JENCKS ACT STATEMENTS.
 

  This issue is related to the prior issue in that it concerns another facet of the appellants’ attempt to discover codefendant Knight’s pretrial statements in order to discredit his testimony at trial.
 

  Prior to the trial codefendant Knight gave government agents several statements which, for purposes of this appeal, will be assumed to be subject to the Jeneks Act (18 U.S.C. § 3500). Following Knight’s direct testimony at trial as a government witness, the appellants made a timely motion to examine all of his pretrial statements. The government objected to disclosure of all of the statements, claiming that the statements contained much matter which was unrelated to Knight’s direct testimony at trial. Therefore the District Court, pursuant to subsection (c) of the Jeneks Act, conducted an in camera inspection of the statements and excised those parts of the statements which it considered to be unrelated to the witness’ direct testimony. Those parts of the statements which the Court found to be relevant to the witness’ direct testimony were submitted to the appellants for impeachment purposes in their cross-examination of Knight, and those parts of the statements which were not given to the appellants were preserved for review by this Court in accordance with the provisons of subsection (e) of the Act. We have examined all of Knight’s pretrial statements and have compared them with his direct testimony at trial. Our examination shows that all of the matter excised by the District Court was unrelated to Knight’s testimony at trial and we therefore hold that there was no error in the District Court’s determinations in this regard.
 

  V. CROSS-EXAMINATION ISSUES.
 

  These issues are related to the prior issues since they too involve appellants’ efforts to impeach codefendant Knight’s trial testimony. The first is whether the District Court erred in refusing to permit appellants to cross-examine Knight about specific crimes, other than the crimes involved in this trial, for which he had been indicted but to which he had neither pled guilty nor been convicted. The District Court ruled that such cross-examination for impeachment purposes had to be limited to questions about convictions for felonies or misdemeanors involving moral turpitude or such crimes to which he had pled guilty. This ruling was clearly correct.
  
   See,
  
 
   *912
   

   e. g.,
  
  Michelson v. United States, 335 U.S. 469, 482, 69 S.Ct. 213, 93 L.Ed. 168 (1948); United States v. Benson, 369 F.2d 569, 572 (6th Cir. 1966); Henderson v. United States, 202 F.2d 400, 406 (6th Cir. 1953).
 

  The second cross-examination issue is whether the District Court improperly refused to permit the appellants to question Knight during cross-examination about his place of residence. One of the questions asked of Knight during cross-examination was his place of residence. Upon an objection by the government the District Court ruled that since Knight was in protective custody of a United States Marshal for the duration of the trial, he would be required to divulge only the state of which he was a resident. Appellants contend that this ruling was error because it precluded them from laying a proper foundation for impeaching Knight through the use of character witnesses who could testify as to his reputation for truth and veracity in the general locality of his residence. This contention is completely without merit. It is true that a witness’ place of residence is a proper subject for cross-examination as a foundation for later impeachment through the use of character witnesses.
  
   See
  
  Smith v. Illinois, 390 U.S. 129, 88 S.Ct. 748, 19 L.Ed.2d 956 (1967); Alford v. United States, 282 U.S. 687, 51 S.Ct. 218, 75 L.Ed. 624 (1931). However, our examination of the record discloses no denial of the right to cross-examine on that subject. Despite the District Court’s ruling that he had to divulge only the state in which he resided, Knight subsequently testified that he had been incarcerated in Tampa, Florida, until approximately one month prior to the trial and that for the one month period between his release from custody and the beginning of the trial he had worked and lived in Tampa, Florida. This information alone, without exact street address, was a sufficient disclosure of Knight’s place of residence in light of his protective custody during the trial and the possibility of reprisals against him because of his testimony for the government.
  
   See
  
  Capriola v. United States, 61 F.2d 5, 10 (7th Cir. 1932).
 

  Even assuming that the District Court’s ruling had the effect of preventing appellants from laying a proper foundation for the impeachment of Knight through the use of character witnesses, the appellants were not prejudiced thereby. Knight’s testimony, both on direct and cross-examination, disclosed that he had ten felony convictions, that he was a former narcotics addict, that he had committed perjury while testifying for the state in a state criminal proceeding in Alabama, and that he was free on a recognizance bond pending sentencing on his guilty plea to the charges in this ease. Further impeachment of his credibility through the use of character witnesses would at best have been superfluous. In any event this was not a case in which the trial court had cut off all inquiry into the witness’ background, thereby denying the defendants “the opportunity to place the witness in his proper setting and to put the weight of his testimony and his credibility to a test” (Alford v. United States,
  
   supra,
  
  282 U.S. at 692, 51 S.Ct. at 219). We therefore find no abuse of discretion or prejudicial error in the Court’s ruling.
 

  VI. PRETRIAL PUBLICITY.
 

  The final issue is whether the District Court erred in refusing to grant the appellants’ motion for a continuance or a mistrial because of alleged prejudicial publicity about the case. When the indictments were obtained in this case in the fall of 1967, local newspapers quoted the United States Attorney as having stated that the case was part of a “colossal criminal enterprise” and that it was “the first several corresponding trials to be held in various sections of the nation.” The record does not indicate whether the United States Attorney actually made the statements attributed to him, but it does show that immediately prior to the trial and during the early stages of the trial in June of 1968 the local newspapers repeated the above quoted pas
   
   *913
   
  sages in stories concerning the trial. The record also shows, however, that the newspaper articles dealing with the trial consisted of only four or five short paragraphs, once accompanied by photographs of the defendants, and that, with one exception the articles were located in the back pages of the newspapers. The news articles were thus a small and inconspicuous part of the general body of news of which they were a part. Furthermore, the insignificant character of the news articles must be contrasted with the fact that each of the jurors selected in this case stated during voir dire examination that he had neither seen nor read anything about the case and the fact that the District Court carefully instructed the jurors not to read or listen to any news accounts of the trial during the course of the trial. Under these circumstances the District Court committed no error in denying the motions for a continuance or a mistrial.

LYNAUGH, Director, Texas Department of Criminal Justice, Institutional Division, Et Al., Defendants-Appellees","

  PER CURIAM:
 

  Edward Charles Varnado has had hip problems since 1967, well before his incarceration in the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, Institutional Division. He has had several operations. A prosthetic device was implanted in his hip at John Sealy Hospital in Galveston in 1985 during his incarceration. He was discharged from John Sealy and returned to his unit two months after the surgery. For 16 months after his return to the unit, Varnado was served his meals in the unit infirmary so that he would not have to stand in line and carry his own tray in the general population dining hall. Such a privilege is known as having a “diet card.”
 

  In June 1987, 18 months after surgery, unit medical personnel determined that the construction of new ramps in the general population dining hall obviated Varnado’s need for a diet card. For most of three
   
   *321
   
  months — June, July, and August 1987— Varnado took his meals with the general population. He alleges that he stood in the serving line 45 to 60 minutes for each meal. In August 1987, he was transferred to a unit for handicapped prisoners.
 

  He claimed that during the period in which he ate with the general population, he experienced pain in his hip. Physicians at John Sealy determined that wires in the prosthesis had broken and that Varnado would need another operation. Varnado attributed the pain and the breaking of the wires to his standing in line for prolonged periods waiting to be served food.
 


   Pro se
  
  and
  
   in forma pauperis,
  
  he has sued prison officials pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, claiming that the revocation of the diet card resulted in the breaking of the wires, which resulted in pain and the necessity for another operation. He claims inadequate medical treatment. The district court held a hearing in conformity with
  
   Spears v. McCotter,
  
  766 F.2d 179 (5th Cir.1985). Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915(a), the district court dismissed the action as frivolous. Varnado has timely filed notice of appeal.
 

  “To state a claim for relief under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for denial of medical treatment, a prisoner must allege deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs.”
  
   Woodall v. Foti,
  
  648 F.2d 268, 272 (5th Cir. Unit A June 1981)
  
   (citing Estelle v. Gamble,
  
  429 U.S. 97, 106, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976)). A dismissal is proper if “the claim’s realistic chance of ultimate success is slight [or] the claim has no arguable basis in law and fact.”
  
   Pugh v. Parish of St. Tammany,
  
  875 F.2d 436, 438 (5th Cir.1989).
 

  Varnado contends that the revocation of his diet card was, or resulted in, cruel and unusual punishment. Varnado’s prison medical records show, however, that he was seen by medical personnel on his unit and at John Sealy numerous times for problems relating to his hip. Varnado’s prison medical record deals almost exclusively with his hip problem. Such records also show that medical personnel determined that the opening of ramps in the dining hall made the diet card unnecessary. Varnado’s contentions amount to a disagreement with his medical treatment; he only argues that the use of the ramps did not meet his needs and exacerbated his hip problem, contentions that fall short of a constitutional or federal claim.
 

  Unsuccessful medical treatment does not give rise to a § 1983 cause of action.
  
   Johnson v. Treen,
  
  759 F.2d 1236, 1238 (5th Cir.1985). Nor does “[m]ere negligence, neglect or medical malpractice.”
  
   Fielder v. Bosshard,
  
  590 F.2d 105, 107 (5th Cir.1979). Even if Varnado’s allegations are true and correct, then, at worst, the judgment about the ramps was only mistaken; such allegations do not amount to deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs. The district court properly dismissed the action.
 

  Varnado also raises in this Court additional incidents regarding his medical treatment that occurred after his
  
   Spears
  
  hearing that were not presented to the district court. “[Ijssues raised for the first time on appeal ‘are not reviewable by this court unless they involve purely legal questions and failure to consider them would result in manifest injustice.’ ”
  
   U.S. v. Garcia-Pillado,
  
  898 F.2d 36, 39 (5th Cir.1990)
  
   (quoting Self v. Blackburn,
  
  751 F.2d 789, 793 (5th Cir.1985)). Varnado’s additional allegations are factual issues that may not be raised for the first time on appeal.
 

  Varnado also questions the authenticity of his medical records. A district court may not use prison records to counter a plaintiff’s
  
   Spears
  
  testimony.
  
   Williams v. Luna,
  
  909 F.2d 121, 124 (5th Cir.1990). Varnado’s allegations, however, address the nature of his treatment and not the lack thereof. He does not question that the diet card was revoked because of the new ramps. The district court did not improperly use the medical records.
 

  Finally, Varnado has filed in this Court motions for appointment of counsel, to supplement the record, and for production of documents. The appeal has no merit, and the requested medical records could not
   
   *322
   
  alter that fact. The motions are denied, and the judgment of the district court is
 

  AFFIRMED.

ORDER

CLEVENGER, Circuit Judge.
Upon review of this recently docketed petition for review, we consider whether it should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.
Joseph F. De Melo petitions this court for review of a decision of the United States Department of Labor’s Administrative Review Board. The Board dismissed De Melo’s complaint for lack of jurisdiction on June 22, 2004.
This court does not have jurisdiction to review the Board’s decision. This court’s jurisdiction is primarily prescribed by 28 *32U.S.C. § 1295, which does not include jurisdiction to review a decision of the Board. In his petition, De Melo asserts that we have jurisdiction pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 5851. That statute provides for review of a decision of the Secretary “in the United States court of appeals for the circuit in which the violation, with respect to which the order was issued, allegedly occurred.” Because our court is not a regional circuit court of appeals, clearly we do not have jurisdiction under that statute.
Additionally, we note that De Melo’s petition for review was not timely filed under 42 U.S.C. § 5851. That statute requires that any petition for review be filed “within sixty days from the issuance of the Secretary’s order.” Here, the petition for review was received by this court on the 77th day after issuance of the order. Because the petition was not timely filed, we need not transfer this petition to a regional circuit court of appeals. See 28 U.S.C. § 1631 (court may transfer an action to a court “in which the action or appeal could have been brought at the time it was filed or noticed”).
Accordingly,
IT IS ORDERED THAT:
This appeal is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.

   *129
   
  PER CURIAM.
 

  Defendant appeals from a judgment for plaintiff in a personal injury action. The only issue presented on appeal is whether the judgment should be reversed because of the failure of the trial court to give defendant’s requested instruction that oral admissions of a party should be viewed with caution.
  
   See
  
  ORS 17.250(4); Oregon Uniform Jury Instruction 4.01.
 

  Plaintiff was driving an automobile west on Interstate 80N near Troutdale. Defendant’s truck was also traveling westward. The truck consisted of a tractor and two 27-foot trailers connected by a ""dolly.” Defendant and plaintiff were traveling about 55 miles per hour. When plaintiff was about two car lengths behind the truck, he pulled into the left, or passing, lane. He saw the truck turn on its left turn signal as he reached the dolly point on the truck. Plaintiff put on his brakes and sounded his horn, but the truck turned into plaintiff’s lane, bouncing plaintiff’s car between the guardrail and the truck several times. The truck driver testified that he looked but did not see plaintiff and did not know plaintiff was there until he felt a bump as the truck and car collided.
 

  Plaintiff testified that after the accident he talked to the truck driver, who stated that he did not see plaintiff and that ""he had quite a few things on his mind at the time.” According to plaintiff’s testimony, the truck driver also stated that he had had a death in his family and that his son had run away from home. At the trial the truck driver testified that he did not ""recall” making such statements, but he also testified as follows:
 

  ""Q Did you mention to [plaintiff] that you had a recent tragedy in your family and you were thinking about that?
 

  ""A I did, after we talked in the car with the Deputy.”
 

  He also admitted that his son had run away about that time but he could not recall whether it was on his mind when the accident occurred.
 

 
   *130
   
  Defendant requested the standard uniform jury instruction that oral admissions are to be viewed with caution.

  The court, in a colloquy with counsel before argument, indicated that he would give such an instruction, but he failed to do so. It is obvious from the record that this failure was strictly an oversight.
 

  The defendant did not except to the failure of the court to give the requested instruction, but, under our statute, it was not necessary to do so. ORS 17.510. However, after the jury was instructed, the following exchange took place:
 

  ""THE COURT: Any exceptions by the plaintiff?
 

  ""MR. McCULLOCH: No.
 

  ""MR. GEARIN:
  
   I have been thinking for 15 minutes, Judge. Usually, I am rather voluble in my exceptions. I can’t think of anything. Other than that they’re all right.”
  
  (Emphasis added.)
   
   *131
   
  consideration of all the matters thus submitted, that the judgment of the court appealed from was such as should have been rendered in the case, such judgment shall be affirmed, notwithstanding any error committed during the trial * *
 

 
   *130
   
  Thus, it would appear that defendant’s counsel, as well as the trial court, overlooked the fact that the instruction was not given.
 

  The instruction was clearly proper and it should have been given under the circumstances of this case. The only remaining issue is whether this error requires a reversal of the judgment.
 

  Article VII, § 3, of our constitution states, in pertinent part:
 

  ""* * * If the supreme court shall be of opinion, after
 

 
   *131
   
  If an examination of the entire record establishes that the judgment was such as should have been rendered, we are required by this constitutional provision to disregard the error and affirm the judgment.
  
   See generally
  
  Justice Lusk,
  
   Forty-Five Years of Article VII, Section 3, Constitution of Oregon,
  
  35 Or L Rev 1 (1955).
 

  An examination of the transcript clearly indicates that the primary issues at trial focused upon the amount of the damages and not upon liability. The defendant’s truck driver should have seen the plaintiff who was almost halfway past the tractor and two trailers when the driver turned into him. It is obvious from the record that the truck driver moved from the right lane to the passing lane without first ascertaining that such movement could be made in safety.
  
   See
  
  ORS 487.220(1)(a) (formerly ORS 483.304(2)).
 

  Considering the entire record in this case, we conclude that the verdict and the judgment entered thereon ""was such as should have been rendered in the case,” and, therefore, the judgment is affirmed under Article VII, § 3, of our constitution.
 

  Affirmed.

   The jury instruction in effect at the time read:
  

   ""4.01. Testimony regarding the oral admissions or statements of a party unfavorable to his interest are to be viewed with caution, for the party himself may have been misinformed, or may not have clearly expressed the meaning, or the witness may have misunderstood him, or it may he that the witness who testifies to the admission, by intentionally or inadvertently altering a few of the expressions really used, gives an effect to the statement completely at variance with what the party actually did say. On the other hand, if you can say from the evidence that the alleged admissions were clearly and understandingly made by the party, that they are precisely identified, and that the language is correctly remembered and accurately reported by the witness, you are authorized to consider such admissions for what you deem them to be worth against the party making them, but in reaching such a result you must, for the reasons given, proceed with caution.”

   MEMORANDUM AND ORDERÃ¢ÂÂ 
  


  PAULEY, District Judge.
 

  AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP and AstraZeneca UK Ltd. (collectively, “Plaintiffs” or “AstraZeneca”) allege patent infringement by Mayne Pharma (USA) Inc. (“Defendant” or “Mayne”), formerly known as Faulding Pharmaceutical Company. In particular, AstraZeneca accuses Mayne of infringing U.S. Patent Nos. 5,714,520 (the “ ’520 patent”), 5,731,355 and 5,731,356 (collectively, the “asserted patents”) by filing the Abbreviated New Drug Application (“ANDA”) No. 76-452 with the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”).
 

  This Court conducted a Markman hearing to construe three disputed claim terms in the asserted patents: (1) “edetate;” (2) “propofol;” and (3) “an amount of edetate sufficient....” After consideration of the parties’ claim construction briefs and their presentations at the Markman hearing, this Court construes the disputed claim elements as set forth below.
 


   BACKGROUND
  


  AstraZeneca is the holder of the approved New Drug Application (“NDA”) No. 19-627 for the manufacture and sale of propofol injectable emulsion. It owns the asserted patents. (Complaint, 03 Civ. 6487, dated Aug. 26, 2003 (“Compl.”) ¶¶ 6, 8.) Those patents have a common specification and relate to a pharmaceutical composition of propofol and edetate.
 

  AstraZeneca alleges that the filing
  
   1
  
  of the “ANDA 76-452 was an act of infringe
   
   *408
   
  ment of one or more claims of the [asserted] patents, under the United States Patent . Law, 35 U.S.C. § 271(e)(2)(A).”
  
   2
  
  (Compl. ¶ 10.) Mayne acquired ANDA No. 76-452 from Baxter Healthcare Corporation, and is now the applicant of record. (Compl. ¶ 13.) AstraZeneca filed its original lawsuit on October 4, 2002. (Compl. ¶ 12.)
 

  During the pendency of the initial ANDA lawsuit, Mayne amended ANDA No. 76-452. (Compl. ¶ 14.) The amended ANDA sought approval “to engage in the commercial manufacture, use or sale of propofol injectable emulsion, 10 mg'mL, in a modified 20 mL vial, as well as in 50 mL and 100 mL vials before the expiration dates of the [asserted] patents.” (Compl. ¶ 15.) AstraZeneca alleges that the “submission of [the] amendment- to ANDA 76-452 was an act of infringement of one .or more claims of the [asserted] patents, under the United States Patent Law, 35 U.S.C. § 271(e)(2)(A).” (Compl. ¶ 23.)
 

  The asserted patents include claims that recite the three disputed elements: (1) “edetate;” (2) “propofol;” and (3) “an amount of edetate sufficient....” However, for the purpose of this claim construction, both parties rely on the specification and, more particularly, claim 1 of the ’520 patent. (Plaintiffs’ Revised Claim Construction Brief, dated Aug. 25, 2004 (“PL Mem.”) at 5, 11; Defendant’s Claim Construction Brief, dated Aug.' 17, Ã¢ÂÂ  2004 (“Def.Mem.”) at 2.) Accordingly, where necessary, this Court will cite only to the ’520 patent.
 


   DISSCUSSION
  


  1.
  
   Canons of Claim Construction
  


  “It is the
  
   claims
  
  that measure the invention.”
  
   SRI Intern, v. Matsushita Elec. Corp. of Am.,
  
  775 F.2d 1107, 1121 (Fed.Cir.1985) (en banc) (emphasis in original). Claim construction “is a question of law, to be determined by the court, construing the letters-patent, and the description of the invention and specification of claim annexed to them.”
  
   Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc.,
  
  517 U.S. 370, 384, 116 S.Ct. 1384, 134 L.Ed.2d 577 (1996);
  
   Cybor Corp. v. FAS Techs., Inc.,
  
  138 F.3d 1448, 1451 (Fed.Cir.1998) (en banc). Claim construction requires a district court to determine “what the words in the claim mean.”
  
   Markman,
  
  517 U.S. at 374, 116 S.Ct. 1384. However, a court must construe “only those [claim] terms ... that are in controversy, and only to the extent necessary to resolve the controversy,”
  
   Vivid Techs., Inc. v. Am. Science & Eng’g, Inc.,
  
  200 F.3d 795, 803 (Fed.Cir.1999).
 

  To determine the proper meaning of claim elements, a court must first consider the intrinsic evidence,
  
   i.e.,
  
  “the patent itself, including the claims, the specification and, if in evidence, the prosecution history.”
  
   Vitronics Corp. v. Conceptronic, Inc.,
  
  90 F.3d 1576, 1582 (Fed. Cir.1996). With this understanding, “the patent is [regarded as] an integrated document, with the claims ‘pointing out and distinctly claiming,’ 35 U.S.C. § 112, the invention described in the rest of the specification.”
  
   Astrazeneca AB v. Mutual Pharm. Co.,
  
  384 F.3d 1333, 1337 (Fed.Cir.2004). Courts look to the intrinsic evidence because it comprises the public record, and public policy mandates that competitors be able to ascertain the metes and bounds of patent claims by reviewing the public record.
  
   See Texas Digital Sys.,
  
 
   *409
   

   Inc. v. Telegenix, Inc.,
  
  308 F.3d 1193, 1202 (Fed.Cir.2002);
  
   Vitronics,
  
  90 F.3d at 1583.
 

  “Even within the intrinsic evidence, however, there is a hierarchy of analytical tools.”
  
   Digital Biometrics, Inc. v. Identix, Inc.,

   See, e.g., Ecolab, Inc. v. Envirochem, Inc.,

While “a patentee is free to be his or her own lexicographer and thus may use terms in a manner contrary to or inconsistent with one or more of their ordinary meanings,” the patentee must clearly state the special definition of the term in the patent specification or prosecution history.

  II.
  
   The ’520 Patent
  


  The ’520 patent discloses a number of formulaic variations of the pharmaceutical composition that is the subject of the claimed invention. In particular, the ’520 patent is directed to sterile pharmaceutical compositions containing propofol for use-as anesthetics. These compositions comprise an oil-in-water emulsion of propofol which further contains an amount of edetate that is sufficient to retard the growth of microorganisms for over twenty-four hours if the composition is contaminated. (Col. 4, lines 38 — 45.)
  
   3
  
  The oil-in-water emulsion is a distinct two-phase system in equilibiium that is kinetically stable, but thermodynamically unstable. (Col. 4, lines 46-50.)
 

  By way of background, propofol is an injectable anesthetic that has hypnotic properties and can be used as a general anesthetic for sedation. Propofol is marketed under the tx-ademai-k “Diprivan” for use in treating humans and under the trademark “Rapinovet” for veterinary use. (Col. 1, lines 7-13.) However, microbial contamination of propofol compositions can cause nosocomial infection among intensive
   
   *411
   
  care unit (ICU) patients. As a result, a “giving set”
  
   4
  
  used to administer propofol compositions must be changed every six to twelve hours. (Col. 2, line 62-Col. 3, line 3.) However, changing the giving set often is cumbersome and costly. (Col. 3, lines 4-19.) The inventors claim that their experiments have revealed that adding ede-tate to the composition obviates the need to replace the giving set at such short intervals. (Col. 4, lines 30-33.)
 

  Claim 1 of the ’520 patent is as follows:
 

  A sterile pharmaceutical composition for parenteral administration which comprises an oil-in-water emulsion in which propofol dissolved in a water-immiscible solvent, is emulsified with water and stabilized by means of a surfactant, and which further comprises an amount of edetate sufficient to prevent a no more than 10-fold increase in growth of each of
  
   Staphylococcus aureus
  
  ATCC 6538,
  
   Escherichia coli
  
  ATCC 8739,
  
   Pseudomonas aeruginosa
  
  ATCC 9027 and
  
   Candida albicans
  
  ATCC 10231 for at least 24 hours as measured by a test wherein a washed suspension of each said organism is added to a separate aliquot of said composition at approximately 50 colony forming units per ml, at a temperature in the range 20 -25 C., whereafter said aliquots are incubated at 20 -25 C. and are tested for viable counts of said organism after 24 hours, said amount of edetate being no more than 0.1% by weight of said composition.
 

  (Col. 11, lines 33-48.)
 

  III.
  
   Disputed Terms
  


  As noted, there are three claim construction disputes: (1) the meaning of “edetate”; (2) the amount of “propofol” required; and (3) the minimum amount of edetate required. (Transcript of Claim Construction Hearing, dated Sept. 15, 2004 (“Tr.”) at 8, 35.)
 

  A.
  
   Edetate
  


  The first disputed term of the ’520 patent is “edetate.” Claim 1 recites a pharmaceutical composition that comprises an oil-in-water emulsion having propofol solvent, which further comprises edetate. Plaintiffs suggest that the edetate ought to be defined as ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (“EDTA”) and “derivatives that are structurally related to EDTA regardless of how they are synthesized.” (PI. Mem. at 25;
  
   see also
  
  Tr. at 8; Declaration of Jules E. Goldberg, dated Aug. 17, 2004 (“Goldberg Decl.”) Ex. P: Joint Claim Construction Statement.) Defendant urges this Court to adopt one of three definitions it proposes: (i) the salts of EDTA; (ii) EDTA and salts thereof; or (iii) EDTA and compounds synthesized from EDTA. (Def. Mem. at 2.)
 

  “The first step in claim construction is to determine the ordinary and customary meaning, if any, that would be attributed to the term by those skilled in the art.”
  
   Boehringer Ingelheim Vetmedi-ca, Inc. v. Schering-Plough Carp.,
  
  320 F.3d 1339, 1346 (Fed.Cir.2003);
  
   Astrazeneca AB,
  
  384 F.3d at 1337 (“[T]he goal of claim construction is to determine what an ordinary artisan would deem the invention claimed by the patent, taking the claims together with the rest of the specification.”). AstraZeneca contends that “[o]ne of ordinary skill in the art here would have a Ph.D. in pharmaceutics or pharmaceutical microbiology, or a B.S. or M.S. with three to five years of experience and training in one or more of the following disciplines: pharmaceutics, industrial parenteral formulation, or pharmaceutical mi-
   
   *412
   
  erobiology, or an M.D. with two or three years clinical experience administering parenteral products.” (Pl. Mem. at 12-13; Declaration of Michele M. Winneker, dated Aug. 25, 2004 (“Michelle Decl.”) Ex. 26: Expert Report of James Boylan, dated May 12, 2004, ¶¶ 43^14.) While Mayne disputes what one of one of ordinary skill in thÃÂ© art would know, it does not dispute AstraZeneca’s characterization of the .qualifications and experience such a person would have. (Defendant’s Reply Memorandum, dated Aug. 31, 2004 (“Def. Reply Mem.”) at 1-2; Goldberg Decl. Ex. K: Rebuttal Expert Report of Jeffrey Wink-ler, dated June 14, 2204.) Accordingly, this Court adopts AstraZeneca’s description of one of ordinary skill in the art.
 

  When construing a claim, a court starts by looking at the “words of the claims themselves, both asserted and no-nasserted.”
  
   Vitronics,
  
  90 F.3d at 1582. “Although words in a claim are generally given their ordinary and customary meaning, a patentee may choose to be his own lexicographer and use terms in a manner other than their ordinary meaning, as long as the special definition of the term is clearly stated in the patent specification or file history.”
  
   Vitronics,
  
  90 F.3d at 1582. The parties do not dispute that the paten-tees manifested their intent to act as their own lexicographers in defining edetate. (Def. Mem. at 8.) Indeed, the ’520 patent includes the patentees’ express desire to impart a specific definition to edetate: “By the term ‘edetate’ we mean ethylenediami-netetraacetic acid (EDTA) and derivatives thereof.” (Col. 4, lines 51-52.)
  
   See As-traZeneca AB,
  
  384 F.3d at 1339 (finding that inventors “deliberately acted as their own lexicographers” where they provided express definitions to the relevant claim elements);

  262 F.3d 1258, 1268 (Fed.Cir.2001) (a pat-entee’s redefinition away from the ordinary meaning of claim terms may occur expressly, when a patentee has “chosen to be his or her own lexicographer”).
 

  1.
  
   Defendant’s First Proposed Definition
  


  Defendant argues that even though patentees attempted to be them own lexicographers, they failed in their attempt, and therefore this Court must give edetate its “ordinary and customary meaning.” (Def. Mem. at 9.) In particular, Mayne argues that the patentees failed in them attempts to define edetate clearly and that their attempted definition is ambiguous. (Mem.Def.8-9.) This Court disagrees!
 

  “It is black letter law that a patentee can ‘choose to be his or her own lexicographer by' clearly setting forth an explicit definition for a claim term that could differ in scope from that which would be afforded by its ordinary meaning.’ ”
  
   Jack Guttman, Inc. v. Kopykake Enters., Inc.,'
  
  302 F.3d 1352, 1360 (Fed.Cir.2002) (quoting
  
   Rexnord Corp. v. Laitram Corp.,
  
  274 F.3d 1336, 1342 (Fed.Cir.2001));
  
   accord Process Control Corp. v. HydReclaim Corp.,
  
  190 F.3d 1350, 1357 (Fed.Cir.1999). “[A] definition of a claim term in the specification will prevail over a term’s ordinary meaning if the patentee has acted as his own lexicographer and clearly set forth a different definition.” ,
  
   SM Innovative Props. Co. v. Avery Dennison Corp.,
  
  350 F.3d 1365, 1371 (Fed.Cir.2003). This is because “[t]he specification acts as a dictionary when it expressly defines terms used in the claims or when it defines terms by implication.”
  
   Vitronics,
  
  90 F.3d at 1582. Further, the patentee may define a claim element more broadly than its ordinary meaning.
  
   See Jack Guttman,
  
  302 F.3d at 1360.
 

  Here, the patentees explicitly defined “edetate”:
 

 
   *413
   
  By the term “edetate” we mean ethylen-ediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and derivatives thereof, for example the disodium derivative is known as disodium edetate.
 

  (Col. 4, lines 51-53.) Mayne, however, argues that the patentees’ use of “EDTA and derivatives thereof’ is ambiguous and unclear. Therefore, Mayne’s continues that the Court must give edetate its ordinary and customaiy meaning, which it posits is “salts of EDTA.” (Def. Mem. at 10-11.) Mayne excludes EDTA itself from this first proposed definition.
  
   5
  


  In ordinary English usage, “EDTA and derivatives thereof’ means “EDTA and derivatives of EDTA.”
  
   See Webster’s Third New International Dictionary
  
  2372 (1993) (definition of “thereof’). Indeed, the patentees expressly listed EDTA as an edetate and provide examples of EDTA derivatives that fit their definition, which conclusively establishes that the patentees intended to define edetate as “EDTA and derivatives of EDTA.” (Col. 4, lines 52-57.) Further, when advancing its second proposed meaning for edetate, Defendant admits:
 

  The passage from Column 4 of the ’520 patent provides a clear and unambiguous interpretation of “edetate.” In construing claim terminology, the court should look first to the intrinsic evidence and employ extrinsic evidence only when ambiguity arises. Based upon this reading of the Patents in Suit, no extrinsic evidence,
  
   ie.
  
  dictionaries or expert evidence, is required to interpret the term “edetate.”
 

  (Def. Mem. at 13.) In light of Mayne’s admission, its contention that patentees failed in their efforts to be their own lexicographers is absurd. Thus, this Court finds that the ’520 patent clearly defines edetate and rejects Mayne’s proposed definition of the term as “salts of EDTA.”
 

  2.
  
   Defendant’s Second Proposed Definition
  


  Next, Mayne argues that if this Court were to consider the intrinsic evidence, edetate must be defined as “EDTA and salts thereof.” (Def. Mem. at 11-14.) This Court disagrees.
 

  Mayne acknowledges that the specification defines edetate as EDTA and derivatives of EDTA. (Col. 4, lines 51-52; Def. Mem. at 12.) However, it argues that because the patentees only listed salts of EDTA as examples of EDTA derivatives, this Court must limit its construction of the word “derivatives” to mean salts. (Def. Mem. as 11-12.) The ’520 patent teaches, for example, that “the disodium derivative is known as disodium edetate.” (Col. 4, lines 52-53.) The ’520 patent further explains that “[i]n general suitable edetates of this invention are those salts having lower affinity for EDTA than calcium.” (Col. 4, lines 53-55.) Finally, it states that “[pjarticular derivatives of use in the present invention include trisodium edetate, tetrasodium edetate and disodium calcium edetate.” (Col. 4, lines 55-57.) Because all these enumerated examples are salts of EDTA, Defendant argues that the word “derivatives” must be construed to mean salts. (Def. Mem. at 12.) Ã¢ÂÂ 
 

  It is well established that examples enumerated in a specification may not be used to limit a claim term.
  
   Prima Tek II, L.L.C. v. Polypap, S.A.R.L.,
  
  318 F.3d 1143, 1151 (Fed.Cir.2003) (“The general rule ... is that claims of a patent are not limited to the preferred embodiment, unless by their own language.”);
  
   Teleflex, Inc. v. Ficosa North Am. Corp.,
  
  299 F.3d
   
   *414
   
  1313, 1328 (Fed.Cir.2002) (noting that the claimed invention may not be limited to preferred embodiments or specific examples in the specification);
  
   Comark Communications, Inc. v. Harris Corp.,
  
  156 F.3d 1182, 1186-87 (Fed.Cir.1998) (noting that limitations from the specification are not to be read into the claims). The portions of the ’520 patents that Defendant points to for support of its proposed definition include phrases such as “for example,” “in general” and “particular derivatives of use.” These phrases make it clear that patentees were merely providing illustrations. No portion of the, specification expressly limits the definition of derivatives to the enumerated examples or disclaims EDTA derivatives not,specified. Further, the ’520 patent explains that “[t]he nature of the edetate is not critical, provided that it fulfils the function of preventing significant growth of microorganisms for at least 24 hours in the event of adventitious extrinsic contamination.” (Col. 4, lines 57-61.) Therefore, this Court disagrees with Defendant that the cited examples in the specification restrict the definition of edetate to EDTA and salts of EDTA.
 

  Mayne argues that the prosecution history of the ’520 patent also supports its contention that “edetate” must be defined as EDTA and salts of EDTA. (Def.Mem.13-14.) They cite to the October 15, 1996 Office Action and the paten-tees’ June 18, 1997 Amendment and Response (“Response”). (Def. Mem. at 13-14; Goldberg Decl. Ex. H.) However, a review of the patentees’ Response clearly shows that the patentees and the Patent Office were not defining “edetate,” but instead were discussing the proper amount of edetate in the claimed pharmaceutical composition and the microbiological tests. Thus, the prosecution history does not restrict the definition of “derivatives” to salts.
 

  3.
  
   Defendant’s Third Proposed Definition
  


  Lastly, Defendant argues that the definition of “derivatives” must be limited to synthetic derivatives only. (Tr. at 47-48.) In contrast, Plaintiffs contend that “derivatives” must be defined as “compounds that have a similar structure to a parent compound” (Tr. at 9-10) and the definition includes both synthetic derivatives and structural analogs.
  
   6
  
  (PI. Mem. at ÃÂ2.)
 

  Where “the patentee has clearly defined a claim term, that definition ‘[usually ... is dispositive; it is the single best guide to the meaning of a disputed term.’ ”
  
   Jack Guttman,
  
  302 F.3d at 1360 (quoting
  
   Vitronics,
  
  90 F.3d at 1582). However, the written description must unambiguously set forth a claim term “so as to put a reasonable competitor or one reasonably skilled in the art on notice that the paten-tee intended to so redefine that claim term.”

   In re Paulsen,
  
  30 F.3d 1475, 1480 (Fed.Cir.1994))). Accordingly, as already stated, because there is no dispute that the patentees intended to
   
   *415
   
  define edetate, the sole question before this Court is whether they succeeded in defining edetate with “with reasonable clarity, deliberateness, and precision” for one of ordinary skill in the art.
 

  The ’520 patent teaches that edetate is to be construed as EDTA “and derivatives thereof.” (Col. 4, lines 51-52.) The key disagreement between Plaintiffs and Defendant is with respect to the definition of “derivatives.” (Col. 4, lines 51-52;
  
   compare
  
  Tr. at 9-10,
  
   ivith
  
  Tr. at 45-47.)
 

  The specification does not expressly define the term. (Tr. at 9, 12.) The parties have cited to a plethora of dictionaries, treatises, scholarly articles and issued patents for support of their proffered defini-r tions.
  
   (See, e.g.,
  
  Tr. at 14-16, 45; PI. Mem. at 16; Winneker Decl. Exs. 28, 41, 43; Def. Mem. at 10, 12, 15, 17-19; Goldberg Decl. Exs. D-G, J, N-O, R-S.) While some of these sources express Mayne’s limited definition, others define “derivatives” more expansively.
  
   (Compare
  
  Goldberg Decl. Ex. J: The American Heritage Dictionary 489 (4th ed. 2000)
  
   (“American Heritage”), with
  
  Winneker Decl. Ex. 41:
  
   Webster’s Third New International Dictionary
  
  608 (1971)
  
   (“Web
  
  ster’s”)).
 

  The Federal Circuit has explained that dictionaries, encyclopedias and treatises are reliable sources for determining the established meanings for the claim terms:
 

  Dictionaries, encyclopedias and treatises, publicly available at the time the patent is issued, are objective resources that serve as reliable sources of information on the established meanings that would have been attributed to the terms of the claims by those of skill in the art. Such references are unbiased reflections of common understanding not influenced by expert testimony or events subsequent to the fixing of the intrinsic record by the grant of the patent, not colored by the motives of the parties, and not -inspired by litigation. Indeed, these materials may be the most meaningful sources of information to aid judges in better understanding both the technology and the terminology used by those skilled in the art to describe the technology-

  This Court begins its analysis by trying to establish the ordinary meaning of the disputed term with an examination of general purpose dictionary definitions.
  
   See Novartis Pharm. Corp. v. Eon Labs Mfg., Inc.,
  
  363 F.3d 1306, 1308 (Fed.Cir.2004);

   see also Inverness Med. Switz. GmbH v. Warner Lambert Co.,
  
  309 F.3d 1373, 1378 (Fed.Cir.2002).
 


   American Heritage
  
  defines a derivative as “[a] compound derived or obtained from another and containing essential elements of the parent substance.”
  
   American Heritage
  
  489.
  
   Webster’s
  
  defines a derivative more broadly: “a chemical substance that is so related structurally to another substance as to be theoretically derivable from it even when not so obtainable in practice (the methoxy of naphthalene).”
  
   Webster’s Int’l
  
  608. Thus, while some of the general purpose dictionaries provide support for Defendant’s suggested definition for derivative, others define the term as proposed by Plaintiffs.
 

  Technical dictionaries can also assist claim construction by showing how those skilled in the art define “derivatives.”
  
   Moba v. Diamond Automation, Inc.,
  
  325 F.3d 1306, 1315 (Fed.Cir.2003) (“[A]s this court has repeatedly counseled, the best indicator of claim meaning is its usage in context as understood by one of skill in the art at the time of invention.”);

  mine the ordinary meaning of a technical term to persons skilled in the art). Here, again, the cited sources provide divergent definitions. Defendant cites to treatises that support its limited definitions. For example, Mayne’s cited treatises support its first proposition that “derivatives” ought to be defined .as “salts of EDTA” (Def. Mem. at 10), as well as its third proposed definition of “EDTA and compounds synthesized from EDTA” (Def. Mem. at 15-16,18). In contrast, Plaintiffs’ cited references suggest that 'derivatives ought to include both synthetic derivatives and structural analogs. (PL Mem. at 13, 16.) The cacophony of dictionary definitions cited by the parties does not aid this Court’s analysis of whether either definition is conclusively established.

  The ’520 patent teaches that disodium edetate, trisodium edetate, tetrasodium edetate and disodium calcium edetate are appropriate EDTA derivative. (Col. 4, lines 51-57.) However, the ’520 patent notes that the exact type of edetate is not important, as long as the chosen edetate can prevent significant growth of microorganisms for at least twenty-four hours if there is adventitious extrinsic contamination. (Col. 4, lines 57-64.) Thus, the specification supports a broad definition of ede-tate: EDTA or an EDTA derivative that can prevent significant growth of microorganisms for at least twenty-four hours.
 

  In support of their proffered definition, Plaintiffs,' pointing to the background of the ’520 patent, argue that patentees used “derivatives” broadly to describe both synthetic derivatives and structural analogs. (PI. Mem. at 14.) For example, they note that the ’520 patent lists the antifoaming agents dimethi-cone and simethicone as silicone derivatives, even though these agents are not synthetically derived from silicone. (Col. 3, lines 40-41; Winneker Decl. Ex. 32 at 48:15-51:21.) Defendant does not dispute that dimethicone and simethicone are structural analogs of silicone, but instead argues that the patentees did not use the word “structural analog” in their patent.
   
   *417
   
  (Tr. at 55-56.) Therefore, Mayne argues that patentees definition of derivatives in the context of EDTA does not incorporate structural analogs. (Tr. at 55-56.) However, it is unnecessary for patentees to expressly use the words “structural analog” to describe all the derivatives contemplated by their invention.
  
   See Texas Instruments, Inc. v. U.S. Int’l Trade Comm’n,
  
  805 F.2d 1558, 1563 (Fed.Cir.1986) (“This court has cautioned against limiting the claimed invention to preferred embodiments or specific examples in the specification”). Patentees may provide a broader definition by implication, such as by incorporating examples that go beyond the literal meaning.
  
   Vitronics,
  
  90 F.3d at 1582 (noting that the specification may define claim terms by implication);
  
   see also Markman,
  
  52 F.3d at 979-80.
 

  Mayne cites
  
   Astrazeneca AB
  
  for the proposition that this Court ought to limit edetate’s definition to “the particular compounds the Plaintiffs tested.” (Correspondence from Jules Goldberg, dated Sep. 30, 2004.) The holding of
  
   Astrazeneca AB
  
  is inapposite to this case. There, the paten-tee disavowed the very features that it was attempting to incorporate into the claim definition: “Where the general summary or description of the invention describes a feature of the invention (here, micelles formed by the solubilizer) and criticizes other products (here, other solubilizers, including co-solvents) that lack that same feature, this operates as a clear disavowal of these other products (and processes using these products).”
  
   Astrazeneca AB,
  
  384 F.3d at 1340. Here, by contrast, the patentees did not disavow structural analogs from their definition of derivatives or criticize their usage. Instead, as already discussed, the patentees use of the word derivatives suggests that they intend their definition to incorporate compounds that are similar in structure to the parent compound.
 

  It bears noting that this' Court evaluates what the specification teaches one of ordinary skill in the art. As noted earlier, there is no dispute here that one of ordinary skill is fairly sophisticated in the art of the claimed invention.
  
   See supra
  
  at III.A. In light of the broader use of the term derivatives in the ’520 patent and the teaching that the exact nature of edetate is not important as long as it fulfills the primary function of slowing significant microbiological growth, this Court finds that one skilled in the art would understand that the patentees intended to use the broader dictionary definition of derivatives. In particular, this court finds that one of ordinary skill in the art would understand that the patentees intended to define derivatives as “a chemical substance that is so related structurally to another substance as to be theoretically derivable from it even when not so obtainable in practice.” Therefore, the proper definition of edetate includes EDTA as well as synthetic derivatives and structural analogs of EDTA, so long as they prevent significant growth of microorganisms for twenty-four or more hours.
 

  Accordingly, this Court defines edetate as “EDTA as well as compounds structurally related to EDTA regardless of how they are synthesized, and which can prevent a no more than 10-fold increase in growth of each of
  
   Staphylococcus aureus
  
  ATCC 6538,
  
   Escherichia coli
  
  ATCC 8739,
  
   Pseudomonas aeruginosa
  
  ATCC 9027 and
  
   Candida albicans
  
  ATCC 10231 for at least 24 hours.”
 

  ' B.
  
   Propofol
  


  The second disputed claim term is “propofol.” Defendant argues that the correct construction of propofol includes “the additional features of (i) being present in any amount where not expressly limited; and (ii) being a phenol known to have anesthetic and antimicrobial activity.”
   
   *418
   
  (Def. Mem. at 23.) Plaintiffs do not dispute that the claimed propofol must be a phenol known to have anesthetic and antimicrobial activity. However, arguing that the amount of propofol must not be construed such that the claimed invention is rendered inoperative (PI. Reply Mem. at 16-18), they contend that propofol should be construed as “2,6-diisopropylphenol” (Tr. at 35).
  
   8
  


  The claim language requires that the claimed composition include propofol as one of its components, but does not mention any specific amount of propofol. In particular, Claim 1 requires the propofol amount be such that the “sterile pharmaceutical composition [is suitable] for parenteral administration.” There is no dispute, however, that the ordinary and customary meaning of propofol is “2,6-diisopropylphe-nol.” (Tr. at 35, 76;
  
   see also
  
  Col. 1, lines 4-5.)
 

  Because the claim language does not require any specific amount of propofol, this Court declines to read that limitation into the claim term.
  
   See Texas Digital,
  
  308 F.3d at 1204;
  
   Advanced Cardiovascular,
  
  261 F.3d at 1338-39;
  
   Johnson Worldwide,
  
  175 F.3d at 992;
  
   Advanced Micro-Devices,
  
  848 F.2d at 1572. Accordingly, this Court gives propofol its ordinary and customary meaning of “2,6-diisopropylphe-nol.”
 

  C.
  
   Amount of Edetate
  


  The final claim term in dispute is “an amount of edetate sufficient to prevent a no more than 10-fold increase in growth of each of
  
   Staphylococcus aureus
  
  ATCC 6538,
  
   Escherichia coli
  
  ATCC 8739,
  
   Pseu-domonas aeruginosa
  
  ATCC 9027 and
  
   Candida albicans
  
  ATCC 10231 for at least 24 hours as measured by a test wherein a washed suspension of each said organism is added to a separate aliquot of said composition at approximately 50 colony forming units per ml, at a temperature in the range 20°-25° C., whereafter said aliquots are incubated at 20°-25° C. and are tested for viable counts of said organism after 24 hours, said amount of edetate being no more than 0.1% by weight of said composition.” (Col. 11, lines 37-48.)
  
   9
  


  Defendant argues that this claim term should be interpreted as meaning “edetate in any amount from zero up to no more than 0.1% by weight of the composition.” (Goldberg Decl. Ex. P. at 5.) In support, it argues that “propofol itself possesses sufficient antimicrobial properties to allow the composition to pass the microbiological test when it is present in certain proportions relative to the water-immiscible solvent component. In reading the claim as a whole, therefore, it is quite possible that no amount of edetate would be required to be added to the composition to pass the microbiological test, depending on the amount of the other ingredients
  
   (e.g.,
  
  pro-pofol and oil) that are present in the composition.” (Def. Mem. at 22.) Plaintiffs counter that the proper construction of “an amount of edetate” is “at least an amount of edetate which is sufficient in and of itself to meet the microbiological test recited in the claim phrase, regardless of the presence of other components in the composition, up to no more than 0.1% by weight of edetate.” (Goldberg Decl. Ex. P. at 5.)
 

  Mayne’s proposed definition encompasses the scenario of no edetate in
   
   *419
   
  the claimed composition. (Def. Mem. at 21.) Reading an express limitation out of the claim is contrary to case law.
  
   See Maxwell v. J. Baker, Inc.,
  
  86 F.3d 1098, 1105 (Fed.Cir.1996) (holding that a court cannot construe claims to read an express limitation out of the claim or render it meaningless);
  
   Texas Instruments Inc. v. Int’l Trade Comm’n,
  
  988 F.2d 1165, 1171 (Fed.Cir.1993) (noting that it is improper to “read an express limitation out of the claims” or “render the disputed claim language mere surplusage”). Further, the specification of the ’520 patent states:
 

  Typically the edetate will be present in the compositions of the present invention in a molar concentration (with respect to the EDTA free acid) in the range 3 x 10""5 to 9 x 10""4. Preferably the edetate is present in the range 3 x 10~® to 7.5xlO""4 for example in the range 5xl0~5 to 5x10^ and more preferably in the range 1.5 x 10""4 to 3.0 x HP4 most preferably about 1.5 x 10-4.
 

  (Col. 5, line 1-7.) Thus, the preferred embodiment requires at least a 3xl0""5 molar concentration of edetate, with 1.5xlO-4 being the most preferred molar concentration. Mayne’s suggested claim construction would exclude the preferred embodiment from the claimed invention. “Such an interpretation is rarely, if ever, correct and would require highly persuasive evidentiary support.”
  
   Vitronics,
  
  90 F.3d at 1583;
  
   see also Hoechst Celanese Corp. v. BP Chernies. Ltd.,
  
  78 F.3d 1575, 1581 (Fed.Cir.1996) (“[I]t is unlikely that an inventor would define the invention in a way that excluded the preferred embodiment, or that persons of skill in this field would read the specification in such a way.”).
 

  Further, the ’520 patent describes that the use of edetate as an antimicrobial agent is one of the key features of the claimed invention: “We unexpectedly found that edetate.... was the only agent that would meet our requirements.” (Col. 3, line 42-Col. 4, line 45.) Thus, it is clear that Claim 1 requires
  
   an
  
  amount of ede-tate to be present. The claim further requires, and both parties agree, that the proportion of edetate in the composition cannot exceed 0.1%. (Col. 11, line 46-48; PI. Reply Mem. at 16; Def. Mem. at 23.)
 

  Accordingly, this Court finds that one skilled in the art would read Claim 1 as “An amount of edetate, greater than 0% but less than or equal to 0.1% by weight of the pharmaceutical composition, which is sufficient to meet the microbiological test recited in the claim phrase.”
 


   CONCLUSION
  


  For the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that the disputed terms in the ’520 patent have the following meanings:

  MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER
 

  HAIGHT, District Judge:
 

  Plaintiffs in this action, would-be candidates for membership on the New York City Community School Board, District 8, brought this action on by Order to Show
   
   *605
   
  Cause to enjoin the holding of school board elections scheduled to take place on May 3, 1983. Plaintiffs alleged that defendants United Federation of Teachers (“UFT”) and District Council 37 had systematically worked to exclude plaintiffs and other minority candidates from holding school board positions by engaging in racially motivated challenges to the legal sufficiency of their nominating petitions, and that the Board of Elections “had permitted plaintiffs to be excluded and their supporters disenfranchised” (Comp. ¶ 10) in violation of 42 U.S.C. §§ 1971, 1983, and 1985 and the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.
 

  A hearing was held before this Court on May 2, 1983, after which plaintiffs’ application to enjoin the May 3 elections was denied and defendant New York City Board of Elections’ motion to dismiss the complaint was granted. The case is presently before the Court on the separate motions of defendants New York City Board of Elections, District Council 37, and the United Federation of Teachers for an award of attorneys’ fees pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1927 and 42 U.S.C. § 1988. For the reasons stated, defendants’ applications are granted.
 

  DISCUSSION
 

  Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988, a court has discretion to award prevailing parties in,
  
   inter alia,
  
  § 1983 or § 1985 litigation “a reasonable attorney’s fee as part of the costs.” A distinction has evolved, however, between cases in which plaintiffs are the prevailing parties and those in which defendants seek to recover fees. A prevailing defendant is entitled to recover costs only where the action brought is found to be “frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation, even though not brought in subjective bad faith.”

  542 F.Supp. 896, 903 (S.D.N.Y.1982). The more stringent standard applicable to defendants is intended to ensure that plaintiffs with uncertain but arguably meritorious claims are not altogether deterred from initiating litigation by the threat of incurring onerous legal fees should their claims fail.

  (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 3, 1984).
 

  A review of the record in this action amply demonstrates, in my view, the legal and factual insufficiency of the claims asserted and the unreasonableness of requiring defendants to expend time and resources in defense preparation on the eve of the disputed election. As noted above, the parties appeared before this Court on May 2, 1983. At that time, counsel for plaintiffs was repeatedly asked to substantiate factually the highly conclusory charges of racial discrimination contained in the complaint. With respect to the allegation that defendant Board of Elections had “permitted” plaintiffs to be excluded from the ballot in violation of their civil rights, the following colloquy ensued:
 

  THE COURT: Do you have evidence that the Board of Elections of the City has applied the election law in a manner which is not uniform?
 

  MR. RICHMAN: Your Honor, we can and are prepared to show that although the Board of Elections has in and of itself taken no specific action, they have made their facilities available in order to document the materials, to wit, opening up the Board of Elections over on weekends and Saturdays for certain parties making that available to them—
 

  THE COURT: Do you criticize them for that, Mr. Richman?
 

 
   *606
   
  Here is someone who comes forward and says, “I think that a particular nominating petition is subject to challenge under the requirements of the election law.”
 

  The Board of Elections in response to that challenge makes its facilities available to evaluate the challenge. Are they to be criticized for that?
 

  MR. RICHMAN: Not at all.
 

  THE COURT: What, then, is your criticism of the Board of Elections?
 

  MR. RICHMAN: To make full availability for one side or the other.
 

  THE COURT: What evidence do you have or can you call of differences in the manner in which the Board of Elections has responded to challenges from one side or the other?
 

  I put that to you because there is no indication in the papers presently that that is what you are charging.
 

  MR. RICHMAN: Your Honor, to be frank with you, I don’t want to stay and get sidetracked with that issue, I am willing to let that issue go by and not rely on that issue at all. I am more concerned at the systematic exclusion of black members from the roles of the persons who are to be elected tomorrow in the school board election. That’s my major concern.
 

  I am not going to allege to you nor will I stay behind that issue or use that as my major issue that the Board of Elections has chosen to be — to favor one side or another, I’d rather not go into that. The subtleties are even too subtle to even emphasize for a long time.
 

  I have been around in a certain political framework and I know what goes on and we all know what goes on, but it is not something that can be established to any degree of certainty.
 

  (Tr. at 9-10).
 

  As the above exchange indicates, plaintiffs were unable to offer any factual or legal support for their claim against defendant Board of Elections. When asked to relate precisely what the proof would show with respect to defendants UFT and District Council 37, counsel for plaintiffs replied only that the unions had backed challenges to the validity of the nominating petitions of 12 out of 18 minority candidates to the school board, while putting up a slate of primarily white candidates. (Tr. at 13-14). Mr. Richman was unable to explain how such private action could be construed as constituting state action for the purpose of sustaining a cause of action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Nor was he able to respond satisfactorily to defendants’ contention that no specific acts had been alleged by plaintiffs to support their theory of a conspiracy grounded in racial animus. Counsel’s entirely inadequate response was that “conspiracy like beauty [is] in the eyes of the beholder.” (Tr. at 51).
 

  Plaintiffs did not contest the fact that they were each found by the Board of Elections to have less than the requisite number of signatures on their nominating petitions. Indeed, Mr. Richman conceded that, in a “petition to validate” proceeding brought before the New York State Supreme Court on behalf of plaintiffs, counsel stipulated before Justice Mercorella to withdraw the validating proceeding in state court with respect to plaintiffs Lewis, Moats and Harris after it became clear that they did not have a sufficient number of valid signatures. (Tr. at 17). The remaining three plaintiffs were eliminated from the ballot after their petitions for validation, submitted to the New York State Supreme Court, were found to have never been verified as required by New York Election Law. Counsel did not contest the fact, brought out during oral argument, that he had prepared the petition to validate which was found by both the New York Supreme Court and the Appellate Division to be fatally defective. (Tr. 28-29). Stated simply, the only proof offered at argument with respect to plaintiffs’ nonappearance on the ballot indicated that three plaintiffs had, in effect, stipulated to their exclusion, while the Appellate Division had directed the Board of Elections to remove the names of the other three for noncompliance with statutory requirements.
 

 
   *607
   
  In a decision from the bench rendered at the conclusion of the May 2 hearing, this Court first noted that plaintiffs had not challenged the constitutionality of the pertinent election laws, either facially or as applied, and that no present constitutional claim could be discerned against defendant Board of Elections from either the complaint or counsel’s argument. Rather, the only arguably constitutional challenge was to the actions of defendants UFT and District Council 37 in supporting certain school board candidates and in challenging the candidacy of others, a choice prompted, according to plaintiffs, by racial animus. This same claim had been unsuccessfully raised in the proceedings before the New York Appellate Division. Given the complete lack of factual support proffered by plaintiffs, I expressed grave doubts that racial animus on the part of defendant unions could be established.
 

  Even assuming plaintiffs could demonstrate that defendants’ actions were racially motivated, they had failed to offer any legal support for the theory that defendants were acting “under color of state law” and thereby subject to § 1983 liability. Indeed, the only conceivable constitutional theory — that defendants conspired to violate plaintiffs’ constitutional rights in violation of § 1985(3) — was found to be insufficiently pled. I noted specifically that the complaint was almost entirely conclusory and, at least with respect to the nonexistent 1981 and 1982 elections, asserted claims that simply could not be true.
 

  My decision to dismiss, however, was not premised solely on the serious deficiencies in the complaint. Plaintiffs had raised and had been accorded a full and fair opportunity to litigate their constitutional claims in state court. Accordingly, by well-established authority, the instant action was found to be barred by the doctrines of
  
   res judicata
  
  and collateral estoppel.
 

  In light of the foregoing, I conclude that this is an appropriate instance in which to award attorney’s fees. Not only were plaintiffs unable to offer any legal support or factual foundation for the constitutional deprivations alleged,
  
   see Gerena-Valentin, supra,
  
  554 F.Supp. at 1021 (award of attorney’s fees appropriate where there is “no basis in law or fact” for claims asserted);
  
   Colucci v. New York Times,
  
  533 F.Supp. 1011, 1012 (S.D.N.Y.1982) (attorney’s fees awarded where “plaintiffs’ alleged claims were without a reasonable basis in fact.”), but counsel for plaintiffs was fully cognizant of the fact that his clients had unsuccessfully raised the claims asserted here in prior state court proceedings. He either knew, or as a conscientious attorney should have known, that plaintiffs were altogether precluded from recycling those same claims in federal court. This is not an instance, in other words, where plaintiffs arguably could have prevailed on the merits but failed to do so. Rather, they chose to proceed in the face of an unambiguous legal bar to the action brought.
 

  Having determined that an award of attorney’s fees is warranted, the question of amount and of allocation among plaintiffs and, potentially, plaintiffs’ attorney must be addressed. Defendants argue that this is an appropriate instance in which to assess a portion of their fees directly against plaintiffs’ counsel pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1927, which provides as follows:
 

  § 1927.
  
   Counsel’s liability for excessive costs
  
  Any attorney or other person admitted to conduct cases in any court of the United States or any Territory thereof who so multiples the proceedings in any case unreasonably and vexatiously may be required by the court to satisfy personally the excess costs, expenses, and attorneys’ fees reasonably incurred because of such conduct.
 

  As construed by Judge Weinfeld:
 

  “The thrust of the section is to curb dilatory practices and the abuse of court processes by attorneys. The sanctions authorized under section 1927 are not to be lightly imposed; nor are they to be triggered because a lawyer vigorously and zealously pressed his client’s interests.

  chill the ardor of proper and forceful advocacy on behalf of his client. To justify the imposition of excess costs of litigation upon an attorney his conduct must be of an egregious nature, stamped by bad faith that is violative of recognized standards in the conduct of litigation. The section is directed against attorneys who willfully abuse judicial processes.” Colu

  In my view, counsel for plaintiffs has engaged in a willful abuse of the judicial process by counselling plaintiffs to pursue constitutional claims they were legally precluded from litigating in this forum. With respect to defendant Board of Elections, plaintiffs do not appear to have ever had any viable claim in mind. Further, as noted in this Court's oral decision of May 2, 1983; the complaint is “almost entirely conclusory” and completely devoid of “factual particularity,” a deficiency Mr. Richman was unable to correct during oral argument. As recently observed by Judge Werker: “Under Fed.R.Civ.P. 11, an attorney who signs the pleading is obligated to ascertain if there is a sufficient factual basis to support the allegations. One sanction for violation of Rule 11 is to tax the offending attorney with his opponent’s legal fees.”
  
   Santiago and Birmingham, supra.
  


  I am additionally troubled by the blatant factual inaccuracies in the complaint — in particular, plaintiffs’ allegation that defendants conspired to violate plaintiffs’ civil rights during the 1981 and 1982 school board elections (Comp. 11115-6), years during which, in fact, no elections took place— and counsel’s failure to reveal to the Court the fact that, on behalf of plaintiffs, he had advanced these same claims.in state court. Certainly the circumstances of the dispositions in those proceedings were critical here and should have been brought to this Court’s attention in the first instance. I conclude, in these circumstances, that the burden of paying the legal fees incurred by defendants should be shared equally between plaintiffs and plaintiffs’ counsel, with Mr. Richman shouldering half of that burden.
 

  In determining the amount of the fees to be awarded, this Court is obligated to ensure that the fees requested by the prevailing parties are “fair and reasonable based upon the particular circumstances of the case ... in sum, the equities of the situation are to be considered to assure that although the deterrent purpose of the statute is enforced, a losing party is not subjected to financial ruin.”
  
   Colucci, supra,
  
  533 F.Supp. at 1012-13. After considering the submissions of counsel detailing expenses incurred in defending this suit, I find them to be reasonable and, in light of the allocation contemplated, not excessively onerous for any one party. Defendant New York City Board of Elections calculates that it has incurred fees totalling $2,475, an amount representing the

  CONCLUSION
 

  The sum of the separate fee awards requested is $5,775. Given plaintiffs counsel’s significant responsibility for what, in my view, constitutes a substantial waste of judicial resources and an abuse of the judicial process, Mr. Richman is to be assessed half of that amount, or $2,887.50. Each of the six plaintiffs is assessed attorney’s fees in the amount of $481.25. Counsel for defendants are directed to settle judgment on five (5) days notice in accordance with this Opinion.
 

  It is SO ORDERED.

OPINION OF THE COURT
ChereÃÂ© A. Buggs, J.
The matter herein, in which plaintiff sought to recover assigned first-party no-fault benefits, came on to be heard by the court on February 28, 2012.
By previous order on a motion for summary judgment, the issue of medical necessity was set forth for trial. The peer review report of Andrew Miller, M.D., which opined that there was a lack of medical necessity for the supplies which are the subject of this case, served as the basis for the denial of the no-fault claim. There was no stipulation between the parties to admit the report into evidence. Since Dr. Miller was unavailable to testify, defendant was prepared to present Steven Marcus, M.D. as its substitute expert witness.
Plaintiff made a motion in limine for a directed verdict on grounds that defendant’s witness, while an expert in his field, would be unable to lay a foundation for the admission of the peer review report. After hearing arguments from both sides, the court reserved decision. Upon due consideration, the court now grants the plaintiffs motion.
While the court acknowledges that the Appellate Term, 2d, 11th and 13th Judicial Districts has consistently ruled that an expert witness who did not prepare the peer review report upon which the defendant insurance company’s denial of the subject claim is based should be permitted to testify as to the issue of medical necessity, limiting the basis of the denial to that set forth in the original peer review (see Park Slope Med. & Surgical Supply, Inc. v Progressive Ins. Co., 34 Misc 3d 154[A], 2012 NY Slip Op 50349[U] [2d, 11th & 13th Jud Dists 2012]; Radiology Today, PC. v Progressive Ins. Co., 32 Misc 3d 144[A], 2011 NY Slip Op 51724[U] [2d, 11th & 13th Jud Dists 2011]; Dilon Med. Supply Corp. v New York Cent. Mut. Ins. Co., 18 Misc 3d 128[A], 2007 NY Slip Op 52454[U] [2d, 11th & 13th Jud Dists 2007]), this court notes that those precedents do not address the evidentiary issue of admission of the peer review report when the author of such report is unavailable to authenticate it. Accordingly, with all due respect to the higher court, this court is unable to follow those precedents without more specific guidance.
*640In Wagman v Bradshaw (292 AD2d 84 [2d Dept 2002]), the Appellate Division ruled that for opinion evidence to be admissible, it
“must be based on one of the following: first, personal knowledge of the facts upon which the opinion rests; second, where the expert does not have personal knowledge of the facts upon which the opinion rests, the opinion may be basedupon facts and material in evidence, real or testimonial; third, material not in evidence provided that the out-of-court material is derived from a witness subject to full cross-examination; and fourth, material not in evidence provided the out-of-court material is of the kind accepted in the profession as a basis in forming an opinion and the out-of-court material is accompanied by evidence establishing its reliability.” (292 AD2d at 86-87 [emphasis added].)
Based on the arguments of defendant’s counsel, it was clear that the testimony of defendant’s witness did not fall into any of the four Wagman categories. Regarding the first, third and fourth categories, respectively: (1) such witness had no personal knowledge of the facts upon which the original peer review rested; (2) the peer review was not in evidence in this case, and its author was unavailable and therefore not subject to cross-examination; and (3) the out-of-court material, in this case, the peer review, is evidence, which if admitted, would have been admitted for the truth of its contents, i.e., that the medical services or supplies lack medical necessity. As such, it did not qualify under the “professional reliability” admissibility rule. “[T]he ‘professional reliability’ exception does not permit an expert witness to offer opinion testimony based upon out-of-court material, for the truth of the matter asserted in the out-of-court material” Wagman, 292 AD2d at 89).
Regarding the second category, in absence of a stipulation between the parties to the admission of the peer review report into evidence, there was no material in evidence upon which the expert’s opinion could be based. Even assuming the medical records upon which the peer review report was based were deemed admissible by this court pursuant to Urban Radiology, P.C. v Tri-State Consumer Ins. Co. (27 Misc 3d 140[A], 2010 NY Slip Op 50987[U] [2d, 11th & 13th Jud Dists 2010]), defendant in this case offered the substitute expert’s opinion testimony primarily to corroborate the findings in the peer review report, not to offer his independent opinion of medical necessity. (See trial *641transcript of Feb. 28, 2012, at 11, lines 10-21.) In any event, where the denial of a no-fault claim is based on a peer reviewer’s finding of a lack of medical necessity, upon an ensuing trial on that issue, the expert whose opinion is most critical is the author of the peer review report. In fact, even in its decisions ruling that an expert who is not the original peer reviewer should be permitted to testify, the Appellate Term has said that such expert’s opinion should be “limited to the basis for the denial as set forth in the original peer review report.” (See Park Slope Med. & Surgical Supply, Inc. v Progressive Ins. Co., 34 Misc 3d 154[A], 2012 NY Slip Op 50349[U], *1-2 [2012], supra; Radiology Today, PC. v Progressive Ins. Co., 32 Misc 3d 144[A], 2011 NY Slip Op 51724[U] [2011], supra; Dilon Med. Supply Corp. v New York Cent. Mut. Ins. Co., 18 Misc 3d 128[A], 2007 NY Slip Op 52454[U] [2007], supra.) However, if the peer review report is not in evidence, the parameters of such report, including the reasons given for the denial, are not a matter of record, and for purposes of trial, are unknown.
Further, this court finds that Urban Radiology (27 Misc 3d 140[A], 2010 NY Slip Op 50987[U] [2010], supra) does not allow the peer review report to be deemed admissible in absence of the proper foundation being laid. That case holds that underlying medical records considered for a peer review report are admissible when they are not being relied upon for the truth of their contents. Conversely, the purpose for admitting a peer review report into evidence in a no-fault trial is for the truth of its finding that certain medical procedures or supplies provided are not medically necessary.
In Wagman, the Appellate Division, Second Department said, “[a]dmission into evidence of a written report prepared by a nontestifying healthcare provider would violate the rule against hearsay and the best evidence rule. Inasmuch as such a written report is inadmissible, logic dictates that testimony as to its contents is also barred from admission into evidence” (Wag-man, 292 AD2d at 87). Further, “[s]uch a written report is patently inadmissible hearsay as the declarant, the preparer of the report, is unavailable for cross-examination” (Wagman, 292 AD2d at 88). While the facts of Wagman are different than those in the case at bar — that case pertains to expert testimony based on an MRI report authored by a nontestifying health care provider where the original MRI films were unavailable — the court finds the rationale in Wagman to be applicable herein, to the extent that both cases involve expert testimony regarding a written report authored by someone other than the witness.
*642In act III, scene II of William Shakespeare’s play Twelfth Night, Malvolio, the steward of Olivia’s household, asks her over imbibing uncle Sir Toby, “Is there no respect of place, persons, nor time, in you?” This court has the greatest respect for the higher court, and has given much sober thought to its rulings that an expert whose testimony is offered at trial to substitute for the preparer of the peer review report should be allowed to testify; however, based on the foregoing, this court cannot follow precedent without further guidance on the evidentiary issues which have remained expressly unaddressed (see Radiology Today, P.C. v Progressive Ins. Co., 32 Misc 3d 144[A], 2011 NY Slip Op 51724EU] [2011], supra).
Consequently, the court grants the plaintiff’s motion for a directed verdict. Judgment to be entered for plaintiff in the amount of $2,263.25, with interest from the date of the summons and complaint, attorneys’ fees, costs and disbursements.

BERANEK, Judge.
The defendant appeals in an action to foreclose a mechanic’s lien. We affirm.
George Raymundo Trucking and Equipment (Raymundo) sued Pembroke Villas of Broward, Inc., (Pembroke) to foreclose a mechanic’s lien. Raymundo furnished Pembroke with labor, services, and materials necessary to clear land, remove trash, and put in fill on the defendant’s property. Pembroke failed to pay Raymundo in full, and a mechanic’s lien in the amount of $2,688 was filed on Pembroke’s property.
After a bench trial, the court determined Raymundo was entitled to a lien in the amount of $2,688. Pembroke appeals alleging that the plaintiff is not entitled to a lien because it failed to furnish Pembroke a contractor’s affidavit pursuant to Section 713.06(3)(d)(l), Florida Statutes (1981). There is no dispute that an affidavit was not furnished.
Raymundo’s services fall within the category of lienors described in Section 713.04, Florida Statutes (1981). That section of the Mechanic’s Lien Law is silent on whether or not a contractor’s affidavit is required. All other sections of the statute are very specific on whether or not the contractor’s affidavit is required. We hold that because the Legislature chose not to specifically require an affidavit under Section 713.04, no affidavit is required. See also American Fire and Casualty v.

261197,261197,2137026,Baggett Transportation Company v. The United States,BAGGETT TRANSPORTATION COMPANY v. the UNITED STATES,"

  DURFEE, Judge,
 

  During the years 1949-1952 plaintiff transported some 2400 truckloads of ammunition and explosives for the Navy Department between points in Indiana and Virginia. The Navy promptly paid for this transportation, including freight charges attributable to dunnage used in shoring and supporting the loads. Upon auditing the Government bills of lading, the General Accounting Office determined that dunnage should have traveled free on many of the shipments. Plaintiff voluntarily refunded some of these “overcharges,” and the GAO recovered the balance by making deductions from money due plaintiff under other transportation contracts. This recoupment was made within six years of the filing of the petition in this action.
 

  Plaintiff now sues for the money recouped by the GAO. It also sues for additional freight on the ground that it erroneously underbilled the Navy for many of the shipments.
 

  The facts giving rise to these claims are as follow. In 1948 plaintiff learned that the Navy Department expected to be shipping a large volume of ammunition and explosives between the Navy Ammunition Depot at Crane, Indiana and the depot at St. Juliens Creek, Virginia. Plaintiff obtained permission from the Interstate Commerce Commission to submit a Section 22 Quotation (a special type of tariff) to the Navy’s Bureau of Supplies and Accounts. 49 U.S.C. § 22. This Quotation, No. 47, was in effect from September 17, 1948 to March 15, 1949. There is no dispute with respect to ammunition carried under this Quotation.
 


   Quotation No. 52
  


  After Quotation No. 47 expired, the Bureau of Supplies and Accounts sent a telegram to plaintiff asking for a new quotation and assurances that in the event plaintiff submitted the lowest quotation, it would guarantee adequate safety practices. In response to this telegram, plaintiff sent a letter on March 23.
   
   *866
   
  1949, expressing interest in trucking more ammunition. Most of the two-page letter dealt with proposed safety precautions. However, the first paragraph stated that we “herewith submit our bid of $1.60 ewt.,
  
   truckload minimum
  
  20,000 pounds, and/or $1.38 cwt.,
  
   volume minimum
  
  50,000 pounds.”
  
   1
  
  [Emphasis added.] Subsequent to this letter, the parties orally discussed new rates. The subject of dunnage, however, was not mentioned. Then, in early April 1949 plaintiff submitted Quotation No. 52, as follows:
 

  “COMMODITY DESCRIPTION
 

  Ammunition and Explosives
 

  TRUCK RATES LOAD IN CENTS
 

  MINIMUM PER 100 BETWEEN WEIGHT POUNDS
 

  St. Juliens Creek, Virginia and within 15 miles thereof
 

  Portsmouth, Virginia, and within 15 miles thereof
 

  AND
 

  Crane, Indiana 20,000 lbs. 160 50,000 lbs. 138
 

  ROUTE: Baggett Transportation Company
 

  EFFECTIVE: April 15,1949
 

  EXPIRES: October 11,1949”
 

  In October 1949 plaintiff extended the expiration date of Quotation No. 52 to April 11, 1950.
 


   Quotation No. 69
  


  During the period Quotation No. 52 was effective, other motor carriers began offering the Government Section 22 Quotations phrased in terms of the going first-class rates. Plaintiff and the Bureau of Supplies and Accounts held oral discussions regarding this new style quotation. Again, dunnage was not mentioned in these discussions, leading to Quotation No. 69, effective November 4,1949. Two features of Quotation No. 69 are relevant here. First, the proviso for alternative application with the rates in Quotation No. 52:
 

  “ALTERNATIVE APPLICATION
 

  “Rates named in this quotation alternate with rates named in Baggett Transportation Co.’s U.S. Government quotation No. 52, effective 15 April 1949, and charges on any shipment of the same commodity moving between the same points shall not exceed charges determined by use of rates named in Quotation No. 52.”
 

  ' Second, Quotation No. 69 stated that Baggett Transportation Company
 

  “ * * *
  
   hereby adopts and makes its own in every respect,
  
  for single line application, Eastern-Central Motor Carriers Association, Agent, Tariff No. 10-A, MF-ICC No. A-38, supplements thereto or reissues thereof * * * as basis for charg
   
   *867
   
  es on shipments of commodities described and moving between the points named above on U.S. Government bills of lading.” [Emphasis added.]
 

  Dunnage is clearly dealt with in Quotation No. 69, although this requires us to navigate the labyrinth of its cross-references. Item No. 1000 of Eastern-Central Motor Carriers Association Tariff No. 10-A (incorporated by reference into Quotation No. 69), provides:
 

  “This Tariff is governed, except as otherwise provided herein, by the following Tariffs, viz.:
 

  “A — National Motor Freight Classification No. 9 (East), MF-I.C.C. No. 17, issued by C. F. Jackson, Agent
 

  And Rule No. 10 of the National Motor Freight Classification No. 9 states:
 

  “Unless otherwise provided, charges shall be computed on gross weights,
  
   excluding the weight of
  
  temporary flooring, blocking, racks, standards, stakes, or similar bracing,
  
   dunnage or supports.”
  
  [Emphasis added.]
 

  Plaintiff terminated Quotation No. 69 on July 1, 1952.
 


   Quotation No. 85
  


  This Quotation, in form similar to No. 52, was issued after the rates were agreed upon in oral discussions in which dunnage was not mentioned. It became effective May 24,1951 and exÃÂ¼ired May 24, 1952.
 


   Tender No. 109
  


  Following oral discussions — which again omitted the subject of dunnage— plaintiff issued Tender No. 109, effective May 25, 1952. Accessorial Services were “as provided in E.C.M.C.A. Tariff No. 10-A and 11-A supplements thereto and reissues thereof.” Tender No. 109 was in existence at least until November 14, 1952.
 

  Obviously there was some overlapping of these four quotations during the period relevant here, namely, April 15, 1949, when Quotation No. 52 became effective and November 14, 1952, the date of the last shipment involved. But whenever more than one quotation was available at the time of a shipment of ammunition, the parties computed the charges under each and used the quotation and rate giving the lowest cost. By this method, the Navy received the lowest applicable rate for each shipment.
 

  Although No. 52, itself, expired April 11, 1950, the parties continued to consider it an alternative quotation by reason of its incorporation into Quotation No. 69, which was effective until July 1, 1952. Quotation No. 52 offered rates of $1.60 and $1.38 cwt., based on a “truckload minimum weight” of 20,000 and 50,000 lbs., respectively. However, when the parties were determining the lowest available rate, they computed charges as though Quotation No. 52 offered the alternative rates of $1.60 cwt., based on a
  
   truckload minimum
  
  of 20,000 lbs., but $1.38 cwt., based on a
  
   volume minimum
  
  of 50,000 lbs. And for many of the shipments the charges billed by plaintiff and paid by the Navy were computed at this rate of $1.38 cwt., based on a
  
   volume minimum
  
  of 50,000 lbs.
 

  On all of the shipments between April 15, 1949 and November 14, 1952, the weight of dunnaging material was added to and included in the gross weights on which the charges were billed and paid— just as though dunnage were “cargo.” Upon audit — as already mentioned — the GAO determined that dunnage was not cargo and recouped the charges attributable to dunnage. Defendant concedes that plaintiff is entitled to charge for dunnage under Quotation No. 52, but not under Quotations Nos. 69, 85 and 109.
 

  Plaintiff is also suing for additional freight on the ground that it underbilled for many of the shipments made under Quotation No. 52. Plaintiff’s argument is that it should not have billed any shipments at $1.38 cwt. based on a
  
   volume minimum
  
  of 50,000 lbs., but should have computed the rate, where applicable, based on a
  
   truckload minimum
  
  of 50,000 lbs.
 

 
   *868
   
  Defendant maintains that Quotation No. 52 is ambiguous and that plaintiff’s letter of March 23, 1949 and the conduct of the parties after the quotation was issued shows that the $1.38 rate was based on a
  
   volume minimum,
  
  rather than a
  
   truckload minimum
  
  of 50,000 lbs. But in any event, argues defendant, the claim for additional freight is barred by the statute of limitations, 28 U.S.C. § 2501 (1958), since the transportation services were rendered more than six years before plaintiff’s petition was filed.
 

  I
 

  The question of whether the rate of $1.38 cwt. in Quotation No. 52 applies in connection with a
  
   truckload minimum or volume minimum
  
  is one of contract interpretation to be decided under Federal law. United States v. County of Allegheny, 322 U.S. 174, 183, 64 S.Ct. 908, 88 L.Ed. 1209 (1944); The Padbloc Co. v. United States, Ct.Cl. No. 523-57 (Apr., 5, 1963), and cases cited therein.
 

  A question of tariff interpretation “does not differ in character from that presented when the construction of any other document is in dispute.” United States v. Missouri-Kansas-Texas R. R. et al., 194 F.2d 777 (5th Cir. 1952). The parol evidence rule governs here, and if the state and Federal cases are not at odds “federal law” may include relevant state cases. See D’Oench, Duhme & Co. v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, 315 U.S. 447, 465-475, 62 S.Ct. 676, 86 L.Ed. 956 (1942),
  
   (concurring opinion)
  
  .
 

  Defendant puts great reliance on the letter of March 23, 1949, where plaintiff offered the alternative rate of $1.38 cwt. based on a
  
   volume minimum weight
  
  of 50,000 lbs. But any importance of this letter is vitiated by subsequent oral discussions held just before plaintiff submitted Quotation No. 52. Furthermore, “It is a fundamental rule of law that prior negotiations are merged into written contracts * * * and that these negotiations are prohibited by the parol evidence rule from altering the terms of the written contract.” Oklahoma v. United States, 173 F.Supp. 349, 146 Ct.Cl. 185, 196 (1959).
 

  Quotation No. 52, set out supra, says nothing about a
  
   volume minimum
  
  rate, “and parol evidence cannot be admitted to add another term to the agreement, although the writing contains, nothing on the particular one to which the parol evidence is directed. The rule forbids to add by parol when the writing is silent, as well as to vary where it speaks * * * ” Thompson v. Libbey, 34 Minn. 374, 26 N.W. 1 (1885). It is difficult to see how Quotation No. 52 could have spelled out more lucidly the conditions under which the alternative rates of $1.60 and $1.38 were applicable. There is no ambiguity here. Consequently, parol evidence will not be considered. Mason v. United States, 169 F.Supp. 507, 144 Ct.Cl. 579 (1959); Western Mach. Co. v. Northwestern Implement Co., 254 F.2d 453, 458 (9th Cir. 1957).
 

  II
 

  Although plaintiff’s interpretation of Quotation No. 52 is correct, its. claim for additional freight is barred by the six year statute of limitations. 28 U.S.C. § 2501 (1958). The rule has long been established that claims for freight, accrue when the services are rendered. United States v. Wilder, 13 Wall. 254, 80 U.S. 254, 20 L.Ed. 681 (1871); Southern Pacific Co. v. United States, 67 Ct.Cl. 414, 419 (1929), cert denied, 280 U.S. 567, 50 S.Ct. 26, 74 L.Ed. 620 (1929), and cases cited therein. The claim for freight and the “right to demand payment [accrue] immediately upon the delivery of the property,” Southern Pacific Co. supra, 67 Ct.Cl. at p. 420, because at that time the claim can be definitely ascertained and set up, and the carrier can “meet any plea of neglect to perform.” L. E. Myers Co. v. United States, 64 F.Supp. 148, 105 Ct.Cl. 459, 478 (1946).
 

  The claim for additional freight is not barred, argues plaintiff, because there was an “open, current, running account against which the statute of limitations did not begin to run until the audit was made and the refund collected. The date
   
   *869
   
  Ã¢ÂÂ on which the refund was collected was the date on which the statute of limitations began to run with respect to that shipment.” (Brief of Plaintiff, p. 13.) The gist of plaintiff’s theory is that since all the Government bills of lading were paid subject to audit under 49 U.S.C. § 66 (1958), its claim for freight could not accrue until the proper charges for each shipment were ascertained by the GAO. This argument is not new. As the court said in Southern Pacific Co. supra, 67 Ct.Cl. at p. 420:
 

  “It will be noted that plaintiff’s contention is that it could not bring an action in this court until the accounting officers of the Government had determined the question of the applicable rate to be applied to the shipments. We are unable to agree with this contention.”
 

  The statute is not tolled while plaintiff awaits audit or even actively pursues any available administrative remedies, unless a “statute requires that a particular administrative remedy must be exhausted * * * ”, Friedman v. United States, Ct.Cl. No. 377-60, 310 F.2d 381 (1962), cert. denied, Lipp v. United States, 373 U.S. 932, 83 S.Ct. 1540, 10 L.Ed.2d 691. See also Empire Institute of Tailoring, Inc. v. United States, 161 F.Supp. 409, 142 Ct.Cl. 165, 168, (1958), and cases cited.
 

  Tying together in the same action, stale claims and timely claims growing out of the same shipments, does not put the former beyond reach of the statute. This was attempted in St. Louis, Brownsville & Mexico Ry. Co. v. United States, 63 Ct.Cl. 103 (1927). Plaintiff had sued for two different sums. The first, $1,407.30, arose out of the carriage, under two transportation requests, of 832 soldiers from Mercedes, Texas, to Fort Snelling, Minnesota. The transportation requests were dated January 23, 1917. Plaintiff tendered a bill for $26,-549.12, based on a per capita fare of $31.91. The disbursing officer decided $29.80 was the proper fare, and reduced the bill to $24,734, or $1,815.12 less than claimed by plaintiff. But because of a clerical error, plaintiff was paid $25,078, or only $1,407.30 less than he billed for. (Two men traveling as livestock attendants were eliminated, accounting for the other $63.82.) The check payable to plaintiff was dated November 23, 1917. The second claim, for $2,070.40, arose out of deductions by the Government as a result of an audit in which the per capita fare for the above transportation was further reduced, from $29.80 to $27.72. The court held that the claim for $1,407.-30 was barred since the cause of action accrued when the transportation was rendered, which was more than six years before plaintiff filed his petition. The claim with respect to the $2,070.40 “would be barred by the statute of limitations of six years but for the fact that the deduction here complained of was not made until 1919.”
 

  Here, as in St. Louis, Brownsville & Mexico Ry. Co., supra, there are two separate causes of action, albeit growing out of the same shipment. This is true since evidence to prove one claim would not necessarily prove the .other. United States v. Louisville & Nashville R.R. Co., 221 F.2d 698 (6th Cir. 1955).
 

  Even if there were room in the law on accrual of freight claims,' plaintiff’s theory of the open, running account would seldom seem to find an appropriate fact situation — clearly one does not exist here. Certain running accounts toll the statute of limitations until the account is “stated.” Woodward v. Armstrong, 64 App.D.C. 4, 73 F.2d 513 (1934), adequately states the point:
 

  “It is settled law that where there is a mutual open account between two parties it is implied that they have mutually consented that the items occurring from time to time in favor of the respective parties shall operate as mutual set-offs,, and that the shifting balance, when either or both shall call for it, shall be the debt, and for this reason the statute of limitations does not run during such a state of mutual dealings, but only from the date of the last item; and if the last item is within the
   
   *870
   
  statutory period of limitations, it draws after it the items beyond that time.”
 

  “But it is generally held essential, in order to constitute such an account as shall fall within the principle in question, that there shall be
  
   mutual open, current dealings and claims subject to a future final balance.”
  
  6 Williston, Contracts § 2030, at 5696-97 (1938). [Emphasis added.] The requirement of
  
   mutual dealings
  
  would not seem to be met in the case at bar, where the services were all rendered by plaintiff, and the Government’s only obligation was to pay for the services as rendered, subject to its right to assure by audit the accuracy of the charges. See 49 U.S.C. § 66 (1958.) “The mere fact that parties have cross-demands against each other,” Brown v. Consol. Fisheries Co., 165 F.Supp. 421, 423 (D.Del.1955) — even where the cross-demands are open, current accounts — does not satisfy the
  
   mutual dealings
  
  requirement. Isthmian S. S. Co. v. United States, 150 F.Supp. 191 (SDNY 1956). “It is essential, also, that the items of the account shall have been regarded as constituting one account
  
   by the parties.”
  
  6 Williston, Contracts § 2030, at 5697 (1938). [Emphasis added.]
 

  The general rule is that “where the account is all on one side, the cause of action arises from each item as far as the Statute of Limitations is concerned.” Brown v. Consol. Fisheries Co., supra, 165 F.Supp. at p. 423. An exception to the rule seems to be found in Missouri, where the statute can be tolled by the one-sided account. See e. g., St. Joseph & G. I. Ry. Co. v. Elwood Grain Co., 199 Mo.App. 432, 203 S.W. 680 (1918).
 

  In Mid-Continent Petroleum Corp. v. Keen, 157 F.2d 310 (8th Cir. 1946), there was a claim for overtime, the labor having been performed over an extended period. In rejecting the running account theory, the court said, 157 F.2d at p. 316, that plaintiff’s “cause of action for overtime compensation accrued on each payday.” The running account theory was advanced and rejected in Isthmian S. S. Co. v. United States, 191 F.Supp. 335, 337 (SD NY 1957). Said the court:
 

  “Claims for freight charges and demurrage cannot be considered to constitute a running open mutual account where it appears that as each service was performed it was regarded as an accrued claim for which a bill was presented.”
 

  This seems to sum up plaintiff’s difficulty, for it, too, billed the Government after each shipment and expected and received payment on that basis.
 

  The running account theory was also advanced and rejected in Chicago, Milw. & St. Paul R.R. Co. v. Frye & Co., 109 Wash. 68, 186 P. 668, 670 (1919):
 

  “It may be admitted that the services were sufficiently continuous, but we see little else to bring it within the statute [providing that the statute of limitations starts running only when the account is stated]. * * * [A]s the shipments were received by defendant, the freight bills were presented, and the defendant paid such of them or such parts of them as it admitted to be correct * * * but the simple fact that from time to time there were disputes or misunderstandings as to the amount due upon a freight shipment * * * and that this is an action embracing all such separate and individual items, does not make it ‘a mutual, open and current account’ within the statute.”
 

  Louisville & Nashville R.R. Co. v. United States, 47 Ct.Cl. 129, 140 (1911), relied upon by plaintiff, is inapposite in an action for additional freight.
 

  Plaintiff’s plight is similar to that of the carrier in Hughes Transp. Inc. v. United States, 109 F.Supp. 373 (ED SC 1953), that is, it did not discover its billing error until six years after the services were performed. But here, as in Hughes, supra, 109 F.Supp. at p. 377, “An audit could have been made immediately after the services were performed” which would have disclosed the billing mistake. Plaintiff could hardly
   
   *871
   
  expect the GAO to point out plaintiff’s errors in billing. Section 322 of the Transportation Act of 1940, 54 Stat. 955, 49 U.S.C. § 66,
  
   2
  
  was enacted because “Congress was desirous of aiding the railroads to secure prompt payment of their charges.” United States v. New York, New Haven & Hartford R.R. Co., 355 U.S. 253, 260, 78 S.Ct. 212, 216, 2 L.Ed.2d 247 (1957). The right reserved to the Government to audit and deduct overpayments is for the protection of the Government, ibid, not the carriers, who can conduct their own audits and sue for additional freight any time within six years.

  Of course plaintiff’s claim for a refund of dunnage charges is not barred, because that cause of action accrued when the deductions were made. Baltimore & Ohio R.R. Co. v. United States, 158 F.Supp. 862, 141 Ct.Cl. 128, 132 (1958); St. Louis, Brownsville & Mexico Ry. Co. v. United States, 63 Ct.Cl. 103 (1927).
 

  Defendant concedes plaintiff’s right to dunnage under Quotation No. 52, except when that Quotation applied as an alternative rate by reason of its incorporation into No. 69. Defendant denies plaintiff’s right to dunnage on shipments made under Quotations Nos. 69, 85 and 109.
 

  Quotation No. 85 is in a form similar to No. 52, set out supra. Neither mentions dunnage. The rule for dunnage should be the same for both No. 52 and 85; and, indeed, defendant does not deny this.
 

  The negotiations leading to Quotations Nos. 69, 85 and 109 did not cover dunnage. But as already explained above, Quotations Nos. 69 and 109 refer to dunnage by incorporation and cross-reference. No. 69 provides that plaintiff “hereby adopts and makes its own in every respect” the E.C.M.C.A. Tariff No. 10-A. Tariff No. 10-A is “governed, except as otherwise provided herein, by * * * National Motor Freight Classification No. 9 * * * ” Rule No. 10 of this latter tariff specifically states that “charges shall be computed on gross weights, excluding the weight of * * * dunnage or supports.” The route may be a bit long, but it was chosen by plaintiff, and the subject of dunnage is dealt with in clear and unambiguous terms at the end. Tender No. 109, similarly, incorporates the E.C.M.C.A. Tariff No. 10-A, and by the same process of incorporation excludes dunnage from gross weights.
 

  Finally, there are two questions with respect to Quotation No. 52. First, was it incorporated into Quotation No. 69 for the life of the latter quotation, or only until No. 52 expired of its own force? The “Alternative Application” provision in Quotation No. 69 which incorporates No. 52 in no way limits the duration of this incorporation. Unless the incorporation were to be effective for the life of No. 69, it would make little sense. First, because Quotation No. 52 would be available as an independent quotation until it expired anyway. And, second, when Quotation No. 69 was issued, No. 52 had less than six months to run before it expired of its own force. It is concluded that Quotation No. 52 was incorporated into No. 69 for the life of the latter, namely, from November 4, 1949 to July 1, 1952.
 

  The second question with respect to Quotation No. 52 is whether its incorporation into No. 69 made it subject to Rule No. 10 of the National Motor Freight Classification No. 9 with respect to dunnage. This question must be answered in the negative. To decide otherwise is to say that the effective rate in
   
   *872
   
  No. 52 was lowered when it was incorporated in No. 69. Nothing in No. 69— despite its many cross-references — compels such a result.
 

  Thus, plaintiff was entitled to charge for the weight of dunnage under Quotations Nos. 52 and 85, but not under Nos. 69 and 109. And the right to charge for dunnage under Quotation No. 52 continued through July 1, 1952 because of its incorporation into No. 69.
 

  Plaintiff is entitled to recover, and judgment is entered to that effect, with the amount of recovery to be determined pursuant to Rule 38(c).

  Justice O’NEILL,

  Frieda Hernandez was seven-and-a-half months pregnant and complaining of severe abdominal pain when she checked in to St. Luke’s Hospital. Dr. Kuhl, an obstetrician, Dr. Sepulveda, a urologist, and Dr. Ramirez, an anesthesiologist, treated her during her hospitalization. Kuhl, assisted by Sepulveda and Ramirez, performed a cystoscopy (placement of a uret-eral stent to relieve kidney obstruction) without electronic fetal monitoring. Hernandez’s baby died during the procedure and was later delivered by caesarian section. Shortly thereafter, Hernandez suffered a cardiac arrest, and died three days later from multiple organ failure caused by preeclampsia

  and HELLP Syndrome.

  The Olvedas, Hernandez’s children, sued the health-care providers for survivorship and wrongful-death damages, alleging that had the doctors complied with the standard of care, they would have diagnosed and treated Hernandez’s condition in time to save her and her baby. The Olvedas filed an expert report prepared by Dr. Suresh, an obstetric anesthesiologist, which addressed Sepulveda’s alleged negligence. Sepulveda filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that Dr. Suresh was not a qualified expert under former Article 4590L
 

  The trial court dismissed the claims against Sepulveda and granted his motion to sever. A divided court of appeals affirmed, holding that Dr. Suresh, an anesthesiologist, was not qualified to testify about the standard of care applicable to urologists, and that in any event the expert report failed to establish a causal relation between the alleged breach of the standard of care and the injury. 141 S.W.3d at 683. The Olvedas petitioned this Court for review.

  Dr. Suresh is a board-certified anesthesiologist. She has been in practice for thirty-five years as an obstetric anesthesiologist, has won awards for her obstetrical research, and holds tenured professorships at Baylor and the University of Texas Medical Schools. Dr. Suresh’s report states in part:
 

  On reviewing the records, there was no evidence of documentation of history and physical examination, assessment or plan of action by Dr. Sepulveda. A reasonable expectation of any physician/surgeon who is planning a nonobstetric operative procedure on a parturient in the third trimester is to evaluate, assess and document a history, physical examination, and rationalize the plan of action. Further it is the responsibility of all physicians involved in the intraoperative care of the parturient to ensure both maternal and fetal well being during the entire intraoperative procedure.
 

  Dr. Suresh did not address the standard of care particularly applicable to Dr. Se-pulveda’s specialty, urology; rather, she addressed the general standard of care applicable to all physicians and surgeons performing a procedure on a patient in the third trimester of pregnancy. She was therefore properly qualified as an expert in this case.
 

  Dr. Suresh’s report also met the MLI-IA’s requirement that the report set forth “the manner in which the care ... failed to meet the standards, and the causal relationship between that failure and the injury, harm, or damages claimed.” Act of May 5, 1995, 74th Leg., R.S., ch. 140, § 13.01(r)(6), 1995 Tex. Gen. Laws 985, 986 (repealed 2003). An expert report “need not marshal all the plaintiffs proof,” but must represent “a good-faith effort to comply with the statutory definition of an ex

   Bowie Mem’l Hosp. v. Wright,
  
  79 S.W.3d 48, 52 (Tex.2002) (citations omitted). A good-faith effort must (1) inform the defendant of the specific conduct called into question, and (2) provide a basis for the trial court to conclude that the claims have merit.
  
   Am. Transitional Care Ctrs. of Tex., Inc. v. Palacios,
  
  46 S.W.3d 873, 879 (Tex.2001). The expert report provided in part:
 

  In a parturient patient who is in the third trimester, having contractions q 3-5 minutes with fetal decelerations, the standard of care would have been to monitor uterine contractions and have continuous recording of [the fetal heart rate] by a qualified individual during the perianesthetic and perioperative period and to have arrangements for a stat eeserian section if the need arose.
 

  [[Image here]]
 

  [I]t is the responsibility of all physicians involved in the intraoperative care of the parturient to ensure both maternal and fetal well being during the entire in-traoperative procedure.
 

  [[Image here]]
 

  Further failure on the part of Dr. Kuhl, Dr. Ramirez, and Dr. Sepulveda to appropriately monitor the uterine contractions and the [fetal heart rate] resulted in adverse fetal outcome.
 

  Although this report establishes no causal connection between Sepulveda’s conduct and Hernandez’s death from preeclampsia and HELLP Syndrome, it is not similarly deficient with respect to the survival action. The expert’s report identifies how Sepulveda’s conduct failed to meet the applicable standard of care and purports to connect that conduct to the baby’s death, stating that Dr. Sepulveda’s failure to monitor uterine contractions and the fetal heart rate resulted in the baby’s death. I would conclude that the report was sufficient under the MLIIA to support the survival action, and accordingly dissent from the Court’s denial of the plaintiffs’ petition.

*242OPINION.
Murdock :
The first transfer in point of time which the Commissioner has determined was in contemplation of death, was the transfer by the decedent to his son Thomas of certain bonds of the par value of $192,500. That transfer was made in 1917 about nine years before the decedent died, at a time when he was about seventy-nine years of age. The decedent, up to that time, had always been a man of unusual strength and vigor. His health, aside from some minor chronic ailments, had been excellent. He was an active man. His *243advanced age is the only circumstance which might indicate that this transfer was made in contemplation of death. The Commissioner points also to two letters written about eleven years previously, and argues that they indicate that the decedent was then contemplating death. However, these letters were written so long before the transfer in question and are so ambiguous as to meaning, that they are of little evidentiary value. On the other hand, the real purpose of this gift is quite apparent. The decedent in the past had given substantial amounts to aid his sons in business. His son Thomas was making money in the sheep business. It appeared that through expansion more money could be made. The decedent gave his son the bonds in question so that this expansion might take place. The gift was complete. It was made for a purpose connected with life rather than with death, and the Commissioner erred in including the value of the bonds in the decedent’s gross estate.
Next in point of time were a series of transfers which the petitioner made on December 14, 1923. One of these transfers was to this same son Thomas. Prior to 1923 Thomas had lost not only the bonds which his father had given him in 1911, but all of his own property and some of his wife’s property. His financial condition distressed his father. The father wanted very much to give his son some immediate help so that the son could support his family and again get started in business. For this purpose he made on December 14, 1923, an absolute and complete gift to his son of certain properties. The value of the properties at that time does not appear, but at the time of the decedent’s death these properties had a value of $60,000.88. The Commissioner is able to marshal stronger evidence in support of his conclusion that this transfer was made in contemplation of death than he was able to marshal in the case of the transfer made in 1917. But the evidence which the petitioner relies upon to show that the transfer was made for a purpose connected with life, rather than with death, is just as strong as the similar evidence relating to the transfer made in 1917. The decedent at the time of this transfer was past eighty-five years of age. Although he was still unusually vigorous and active for a man of his years, nevertheless he had slowed up considerably. He had been confined to his home in the care of a nurse for a number of weeks during the fall of 1923 as a result of the removal of a carbuncle. He took some steps about this time to dispose of his home, and there is other evidence which has some tendency to support the Commissioner’s determination. The weight of the evidence, however, is that this transfer was not made in contemplation of death.
The other transfers made on December 14, 1923, were made by the decedent to a bank in trust to pay the income from the trust *244property to the decedent and his wife for life, and then to pay all of the trust funds of the one trust to Katherine, the wife of Thomas, and all of the funds of the other trust to Nelson Story, Jr. The facts leading up to these transfers have been set out in detail in the findings of fact and need not be repeated. Suffice to say that the decedent, in transferring these funds, was merely carrying out his earlier agreement to hold amounts received from his sons under those earlier agreements in trust, and eventually to return those funds to the sons. Thomas preferred that his share should be paid, to his wife. After the decedent’s death, suits were instituted in the courts of Montana by the administrator of the estate of the decedent and also by Rose Story Hogan. The plaintiffs challenged all of the transfers made by the decedent on December 14, 1923, and sought to recover from the defendants the properties transferred. Some of these proceedings were taken to the court of last resort of the state. The court, in each instance, upheld the transfers and held that the properties transferred in trust subject to a life estate, had at all times been the property of the sons and had not been the property of the decedent. Roecher v. Commercial National Bank, 87 Mont. 570; 289 Pac. 388; Roecher v. Story, 91 Mont. 28; 5 Pac. (2d) 205. It may be that we are bound by those decisions on the question of the ownership of the property which was placed in the trusts on December 14, 1923. Cf. United States v. Robbins, 269 U. S. 315; Burk-Waggoner Oil Association v. Hopkins, 269 U. S. 100; Freuler v. Helvering, 291 U. S. 35; Blair v. Commissioner, 300 U. S. 5, affirming 31 B. T. A. 1192. If, however, we are at liberty to draw our own conclusion from the evidence in this case, it is that the decedent was merely a trustee of the property, who transferred bare legal title to another’ trustee. Cf. Fidelity & Columbia Trust Co. v. Lucas, 7 Fed. (2d) 146. Since the property belonged to the sons and not to the decedent, it could not be the subject of a transfer within the meaning of section 302 of the Revenue Act of 1926.
The decedent on February 23, 1924, transferred to his son Walter and to his daughter all the rest of his property. The Commissioner included in the gross estate the value at the time of death of all of the property transferred on February 23, 1924. The petitioners have raised no issue in their pleadings challenging his action in regard to the properties transferred to the daughter. Nevertheless, they argue in their briefs that the transfers to the daughter were improperly included in the gross estate. Since that issue is not raised by the pleadings, it need not be decided. However, the transfers to the daughter were just like the transfers to the son on that date. The transfers to the son were in contemplation of death, and, if *245the transfers to the daughter were properly in issue, the holding would have to be that they likewise were in contemplation of death. The record fails to show any purpose which the decedent might have had in making those transfers which would be inconsistent with the making of a transfer in contemplation of death. That is, no purpose for the transfers appears which would have to do with continuing life rather than impending death. On the contrary, there is affirmative evidence in the record indicating that these particular transfers were made in contemplation of death. The transfers were made shortly after the death of the decedent’s wife. He was depressed and nervous following her death and was confined to his home for two months constantly attended by nurses. He revoked his will on the same day that he made these transfers by an instrument in the following terms:
Having previously disposed of my personal property, I am this day disposing of my real estate, therefore leaving no will. Any will, or wills heretofore made by me are hereby revoked, nullified and made void.
The evidence as a whole certainly fails to show that the Commissioner erred in including the transfers of February 23, 1924, in the decedent’s gross estate.
It. is apparent from the foregoing discussion that there is a deficiency in estate tax and, consequently, it is necessary to consider the alternative issues raised by each petitioner. The alternative issues are the same in principle. Each petitioner contends that his liability as a transferee is limited to the tax upon the particular property received by him. There are numerous decisions, however, to the effect that the liability of transferees is joint and several, and that the liability of each transferee is¡ limited only to the value of the transferred property received by that transferee. Phillips v. Commissioner, 283 U. S. 589; Grand Rapids National Bank, 15 B. T. A. 1166; Eleanor Lansburgh, Administratrix, 35 B. T. A. 928.
There is no question about the values. This really disposes of all of the issues raised. However, there is another matter that demands discussion despite the fact that no issue is raised by the petitioners. The point is that the Commercial National Bank, Katherine F. Story, Thomas B. Story, and Nelson Story, Jr., are not liable as transferees because none of them received any property properly included in the decedent’s gross estate. The property which came to three of those petitioners was property placed in trust by the decedent on December 14, 1923. It has already been held that that property was not property of the decedent and was not properly included in his gross estate. The transfers to Thomas were not in contemplation of death. Thus he received no part of the *246decedent’s gross estate. Walter P. Story received property, properly included in the gross estate, exceeding in value, at the time of the decedent’s death, the amount of the deficiency with interest.
Reviewed by the Board.,

Decision of no transferee liability will be entered in the cases of the four petitioners, and decision will be entered u/nder Rule 50 in the case of Walter P. Story-.

5626631,5773263,62128197,Mayor of Butler v. Duncan,MAYOR & COUNCIL OF BUTLER v. DUNCAN,"
Felton, J.
F. E. Duncan filed suit by summons in a justice’s court against the plaintiff in error, for fees for survey and services for proposed waterworks, said services being rendered on September 1, 1935. Suit was for $200, less cash payment of $100. The municipality denied the account, on the ground that the city had no right or authority to use the tax money of the city for such purpose, and sought to recoup the $100 paid. The case was appealed to the superior court by consent, and a verdict was directed against the city- for $100. The defendant in error introduced the only evidence, it being substantially as follows: That defendant in error was an architect and engineer with offices in Columbus; that in September, 1935, he was called to Butler to consult with officials of the city regarding a proposed system of waterworks; that he consulted with M. E. Williamson, T. B. Joiner, and Mercer Smith, who were at that time members of the council; that most of his dealings Avere with Mr. Williamson; that he traded with Mr. Williamson as councilman, to survey the town of Butler for determination of costs and location for proposed municipal waterworks system; that he was to furnish the blueprints and specifications, and prepare and file an application for a grant of funds from the Public Works Administration; that he Avas advised that the city Avas to have an election for the purpose of floating bonds to finance, said system; that he agreed with Mr. Williamson that the city was to pay him $200 for the survey and blue-prints and other work, provided the bond flotation was not authorized by the voters according to law; that if the bond issue passed, he was to do the construction on a percentage basis; that he made the survey, prepared the specifications and the blueprints, made application to the Public Works Adminstration, and made two or three trips to Atlanta in the interest of the City of Butler; that the bond issue did not carry; that the city paid him $100, and advised him, in January, 1937, that if he would present the blue-prints and specifications that they would pay the balance of $100; that the blue-prints were sent, and upon receipt of them the payment of the balance of $100 Avas refused. M. E. Williamson testified that he was a member of the council, and was *541appointed on a committee to make a trade with the defendant in error; that proper resolutions were passed by the council, authorizing the said trade; and that the facts detailed by defendant in error were substantially true.
The attorney for the plaintiff in error made a motion to dismiss the summons, on the ground that it did not appear therein that the account sued on was within the power of the municipality to enter into, or create a debt under the constitution of the State of Georgia. The court overruled this motion, and directed a verdict for the defendant in error. The plaintiff in error assigns that judgment as error.
There is no indication from the pleadings or the evidence that the transactions were other than cash transactions. While the balance on the alleged debt was not promptly paid, there is nothing in the pleadings or the evidence to indicate that the creation of a new debt was intended by the city or the defendant in error. The payment of the first $100 was proper, and did not involve the creation of a debt. The same is true of the promise to pay the second $100 upon the delivery of the plans and specifications. The direction of the verdict against the city was proper.
Strictness of pleading not being required in a justice’s court, there was no error in refusing to dismiss the summons because it did not allege that the debt sued for was within the city’s power to contract.

Judgment affirmed.

  Opinion
 

  JOHNSON, J.
 

  The issue in this appeal is whether an amended complaint for wrongful death filed by a husband after the statute of limitations had run relates back to a timely action by the husband for loss of consortium. We hold that the relation back doctrine applies under these circumstances.
 

  Facts and Proceedings Below
 

  The action was originally filed on May 12, 1978, by the current plaintiff and appellant, Ronald Lamont, and his wife, Berniece Lamont. They alleged that Bemiece Lamont was admitted to UCLA Hospital in May of 1977 for treatment of an illness, and that, as a proximate result of medical negligence by the defendants, she suffered personal injuries. The first cause of action sought recovery on behalf of Berniece Lamont for those alleged injuries and the second cause of action sought recovery on behalf of Ronald Lamont for loss of consortium.
 

  Bemiece Lamont died on October 9, 1979, allegedly as the result of defendants’ medical malpractice. Although the motion to file an amended complaint was not made until November 19, 1980, we gather that defendants were notified of Mrs. Lament’s death on October 10, 1980, when the parties appeared in court on defendants’ discovery motion. Ronald Lamont has proceeded in propria persona throughout this case. This probably explains the delay in amending the complaint. Mr. Lamont states that he did not realize an amendment adding a cause of action for wrongful death was necessary because Berniece Lament’s death resulted from the same negligent acts of defendants alleged in the original complaint. Apparently he first became aware of the need to amend the complaint when he discussed the case with an attorney around the time of the October 10, 1980, discovery motion.
 

  The trial court granted Mr. Lament’s motion to file an amended complaint and that complaint was filed on February 13, 1981.
 

  The amended complaint alleges three causes of action. The first cause of action seeks damages on behalf of Ronald Lamont for the wrongful death of Ber
   
   *378
   
  niece Lamont. It is alleged that Ronald Lamont is the decedent’s sole surviving heir and that her death was proximately caused by the same medical negligence of defendants that was the subject of the original complaint. The second cause of action is a survival action brought by Ronald Lamont as administrator of the decedent’s estate seeking recovery of the medical expenses and loss of earnings of Bemiece Lamont prior to her death. The third cause of action repeats the allegations of medical negligence and seeks recovery of Bemiece Lamont’s medical and related expenses as well as general damages.
 

  Defendants demurred to the wrongful death cause of action on the ground that it is barred by Code of Civil Procedure, section 340.5 because it was not filed within one year of Berniece Lament’s death.
  
   1
  
  The trial court sustained the demurrer to the wrongful death cause of action without leave to amend and Ronald Lamont appeals. We reverse.
 

  The Relation Back Doctrine Is Applicable to This Case
 

  An action for death arising out of alleged medical negligence must be brought within one year of the date that the plaintiff discovers or should have discovered the injury. (Code Civ. Proc., § 340.5.) Here the injury, the death of Berniece Lamont, occurred on October 9,1979. Ronald Lamont did not file his amended complaint for wrongful death until February 13, 1981. Thus the wrongful death action is barred by the statute of limitations unless it relates back to the filing date of Mr. Lament’s complaint for loss of consortium.

  The leading case on the “relation back” doctrine is
  
   Austin
  
  v.
  
   Massachusetts Bonding & Insurance Co.
  
  (1961) 56 Cal.2d 596 [15 Cal.Rptr. 817], (2) There the court stated: “The modern mle with respect to actions involving parties designated by their trae names in the original complaint is that, where an amendment is sought after the statute of limitations has ran, the amended complaint will be deemed filed as of the date of the original complaint provided recovery is sought in both pleadings on the same general set of facts. . . . This rale is the result of a development which, in furtherance of the policy that cases should be decided on their merits, gradually broadened the right of a party to amend a pleading without incurring the bar of the statute of limitations.”
  
   (Id.
  
  at p. 600.) (Citations omitted.) The court emphasized that it is the sameness of the facts rather than the rights or obligations arising from those facts that is determinative.
  
   (Id.
  
  at p. 601.) The court cited with approval the federal rales for
   
   *379
   
  mula: “Whenever the claim or defense asserted in the amended pleading arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set forth ... in the original pleading, the amendment relates back to the date of the original pleading.” (Fed. Rules Civ. Proc., rule 15(c), 28 U.S.C.;
  
   3
  

   Austin, supra,
  
  56 Cal.2d at pp. 601-602, fn. 2.)
 

  The original complaint in
  
   Austin
  
  was against a securities broker. It sought recovery of securities and money the broker had received on plaintiffs’ behalf but had refused to deliver. (56 Cal.2d at p. 598.) The amended complaint alleged a new cause of action against a new defendant, Massachusetts Bonding, based on a surety bond executed by that company for the faithful performance of the broker’s duties.
  
   (Id.
  
  at p. 599.) The court held that the amended complaint against Massachusetts Bonding was not barred by the statute of limitations. “[T]he original complaint and the amended complaint allege the same defalcations . . . and these defalcations constitute the grounds for the action on the bond added by the amended complaint.”
  
   (Id.
  
  at p. 602.)

  In the instant case, Ronald Lamont originally sued for loss of consortium and subsequently amended the complaint to sue for wrongful death. Both complaints issue from the same negligent acts of defendants and the same injuries to Mr. Lamont.
 

  The original complaint alleges that defendants were negligent in their examination, diagnosis and treatment of Bemiece Lamont thereby depriving Ronald Lamont of his wife’s consortium. The amended complaint alleges that this very same negligence by the same defendants resulted in the death of Berniece Lamont. In this respect the present case is analogous to
  
   Grudt
  
  v.
  
   City of Los Angeles
  
  (1970) 2 Cal.3d 575 [86 Cal.Rptr. 465, 468 P.2d 825]. The original complaint in
  
   Grudt
  
  alleged that the plaintiff’s husband was wrongfully killed by city police officers. The city’s liability was predicated on respondeat superior. The amended complaint alleged a new theory: that the city was negligent in employing these particular police officers whom it knew to be dangerous. The gravamen of both actions was the conduct of the police officers in the same shooting incident, thus the amended complaint related back to the original. (2 Cal.3d at p. 584.) See also
  
   Weinstock
  
  v.
  
   Eissler
  
  (1964) 224 Cal.App.2d 212 [36 Cal.Rptr. 573] in which an amended complaint alleging fraud was held to relate back to the original complaint for medical malpractice.
   
   *380
   
  “The defendant’s act for which plaintiff seeks recovery is the same—the performance of the cerebral angiogram and spinal tap.” (224 Cal.App.2d at p. 234.)
 

  The injuries suffered by Ronald Lamont as husband suing for loss of consortium and as heir suing for wrongful death are personal to him and include the same elements of loss of love, companionship, affection, society, sexual relations, and solace.
  
   (Krouse
  
  v.
  
   Graham
  
  (1977) 19 Cal.3d 59, 70 [137 Cal.Rptr. 863, 562 P.2d 1022].)
 

  The identity of the parties and the injuries distinguishes the case at bar from cases such as
  
   Dominguez
  
  v.
  
   City of Alhambra
  
  (1981) 118 Cal.App.3d 237 [173 Cal.Rptr. 345] and
  
   Shelton
  
  v.
  
   Superior Court
  
  (1976) 56 Cal.App.3d 66 [128 Cal.Rptr. 454], cited by defendants. In those cases one plaintiff sought to relate back his own independent cause of action to a complaint filed by another plaintiff for the violation of a different right.
  
   5
  
  Here the plaintiff’s wrongful death action like his claim for loss of consortium is personal to him.
  
   (Larcher
  
  v.
  
   Wanless, supra,
  
  18 Cal.3d at pp. 656-657;
  
   Rodriguez
  
  v.
  
   Bethlehem Steel Corp.
  
  (1974) 12 Cal.3d 382, 408 [115 Cal.Rptr. 765, 525 P.2d 669].) Both actions are entirely distinct from any cause of action Berniece Lamont could have maintained during her lifetime. (Cf.
  
   Dominguez
  
  v.
  
   City of Alhambra, supra,
  
  118 Cal.App.3d at p. 243;
  
   Shelton
  
  v.
  
   Superior Court, supra,
  
  56 Cal.App.3d at p. 81.)
 

  Defendants contend that since Ronald Lamont as husband is a different party than Ronald Lamont as heir, relation back should be denied under the rationale of
  
   Dominguez
  
  and
  
   Shelton, supra.
  
  We see no sense in making the distinction urged by defendants. The fact that Mr. Lamont now sues in a different capacity does not prejudice the defendants nor does it alter the operative facts on which the original and amended complaints are based. (Cf.
  
   Olsen
  
  v.
  
   Lockheed Aircraft Corp.
  
  (1965) 237 Cal.App.2d 737, 741 [47 Cal.Rptr. 242].)
 

  Application of the relation back doctrine in this case will not thwart the purpose of the statute of limitations. The primary purpose of the relatively short time limit on personal injury actions is to stimulate the plaintiff to activity while the defendant still has a fair opportunity to prepare an adequate defense (see
  
   Pashley
  
  v.
  
   Pacific Elect. Ry. Co.
  
  (1944) 25 Cal.2d 226, 229 [153 P.2d 325]); that is, before “evidence has been lost, memories have faded, and witnesses have disappeared.”
  
   (Telegraphers
  
  v.
  
   Ry. Express Agency
  
  (1944) 321 U.S. 342, 349 [88 L.Ed. 788, 792, 64 S.Ct. 582].) It has also been suggested that reducing the time between injury and litigation facilitates evaluation of the extent of the injuries and reduces the risk of false claims.
  
   (Developments in the
  
 
   *381
   

   Law—Statutes of Limitations
  
  (1950) 63 Harv.L.Rev. 1177, 1193 [hereinafter cited as
  
   Developments].)
  
  Thus, the policy behind the statute of limitations is satisfied where the defendant is put on notice of the need to defend plaintiff’s claim in time to prepare a fair defense on the merits. (See
  
   N. Y. Cent. R.R.
  
  v.
  
   Kinney
  
  (1922) 260 U.S. 340, 346 [67 L.Ed. 294, 296, 43 S.Ct. 122];
  
   Craig
  
  v.
  
   United States
  
  (9th Cir. 1969) 413 F.2d 854, 857;
  
   Relation Back of Amendments, supra,
  
  pp. 116-117 and see
  
   Smeltzley
  
  v.
  
   Nicholson Mfg. Co.
  
  (1977) 18 Cal.3d 932 [136 Cal.Rptr. 269, 559 P.2d 624, 85 A.L.R.3d 121] and cases cited therein.)
 

  In the instant case, defendants conceded in the trial court that the amended complaint is based on the same alleged acts of medical negligence as the original complaint and is directed against the same defendants. As Justice Holmes observed in
  
   N.Y. Cent. R.R.
  
  v.
  
   Kinney, supra, 260
  
  U.S. at page 346 [67 L.Ed. at page 296]: “[W]hen a defendant has had notice from the beginning that the plaintiff sets up and is trying to enforce a claim against it because of specified conduct, the reasons for the statute of limitations do not exist. . . .” While it is true that defending the wrongful death claim may require the defendants to gather additional evidence, this burden exists in every relation back case.
  
   (Smeltzley
  
  v.
  
   Nicholson Mfg. Co., supra,
  
  18 Cal.3d at p. 940.) The test is whether the two complaints relate to the same
  
   general
  
  set of facts. If they do, the relation back doctrine applies.
  
   (Austin
  
  v.
  
   Massachusetts Bonding Co., supra,
  
  56 Cal.2d at p. 600.) As we explained above at pages 378-380, this test is met in the case at bar. There is little likelihood in this case that defendants will be prejudiced by the loss of evidence, fading memories or disappearance of witnesses. Unlike some personal injury actions which may involve numerous nonparty witnesses, in this case the chief witnesses for the defense are the defendants themselves, their agents and employees. The medical records of Bemiece Lamont are in the custody of defendants. By the time they were notified of Bemiece Lamont’s death defendants should already have taken the necessary steps to gather and preserve evidence bearing on the Lamont’s claims of medical malpractice and Ronald Lamont’s damages for loss of consortium. This evidence forms the core of the defense to the wrongful death action and defines defendants’ position on the amount of damages if liability is established.
 

  Defendants also argue that it is illogical to apply the relation back doctrine in this case because it would result in Mr. Lamont’s wrongful death action relating back to a date before it ever existed. This argument ignores the fact that in both claims Mr. Lamont is seeking recovery for essentially the same loss. As the court noted in
  
   Krouse
  
  v.
  
   Graham, supra,
  
  19 Cal.3d 59, a wrongful death action brought by the decedent’s husband, “[I]n California those elements of recovery sought by Benjamin Krouse herein clearly would be available to him as ‘consortium’ damages in the usual personal injury action for his wife’s injuries.” (19 Cal.3d at p. 70.) At common law Ronald Lamont’s right to recover for the
   
   *382
   
  loss of his wife’s society would have ended upon her death. There was no right of action for the wrongful death of a human being.
  
   (Van Beeck
  
  v.
  
   Sabine Towing Co.
  
  (1937) 300 U.S. 342, 344-346 [81 L.Ed. 685, 686-688, 57 S.Ct. 452].) While Code of Civil Procedure section 377 creates a cause of action for wrongful death, under the circumstances of this case it is not a wholly different cause of action but more a continuation under a different name of the original cause of action for loss of consortium.
 

  Appealability
 

  Ronald Lamont appeals from the order sustaining the demurrer to his cause of action for wrongful death. Such an order is not appealable. Defendants are aware of this defect but urge us to decide the case on the merits rather than dismiss the appeal.  Therefore, in the interests of justice and to prevent unnecessary delay we will deem the order sustaining the demurrer to incorporate a judgment of dismissal of Mr. Lamont’s action for wrongful death and treat his notice of appeal as applying to the dismissal.
  
   (California State Employees’ Assn.
  
  v.
  
   State of California
  
  (1973) 32 Cal.App.3d 103, 106, fn. 1 [108 Cal.Rptr. 60].) The order as modified is appealable because it is a final judgment with respect to Ronald Lamont in his capacity as heir of Berniece Lamont.
  
   (Dominguez
  
  v.
  
   City of Alhambra, supra,
  
  118 Cal.App.3d at p. 242, fn. 1.)
 

  The order sustaining the demurrer to the wrongful death cause of action is modified by adding thereto the following sentence: “Plaintiff’s action for wrongful death is dismissed.” The order as modified is reversed.
 

  Schauer, P. J., and Thompson, J., concurred.

   Defendants also demurred to the third cause of action on the ground that general damages are not recoverable in a survivorship action. That demurrer was sustained with leave to amend and is not before us on this appeal.

   Mr. Lamont does not allege any delay in discovering his wife’s death. Therefore, the one-year limitations period commenced to run on October 9, 1979.

DAVIS, District Judge.
This is an action to recover an alleged over payment of estate taxes. The action was filed on August 2, 1927, by the executors of the estate of Alexander H. Handlan, deceased. On November 5, 1935, Thomas N. Dysart, trustee under the will of Alexander H. Handlan, was substituted as the plaintiff. The parties waived a jury and the cause was submitted to the court.
Findings of Fact.
I. On May 28, 1921, Alexander H. Handlan, a resident of the city of St. Louis, Mo., died testate in said city. At the time of his death said Alexander H. Handlan left a will, which, after providing for the payment of certain specific legacies, directed that all of the rest, residue, and remainder of his estate should be turned over and delivered to his sons, Eugene W. Handlan, Alexander H. Handlan, Jr., and Edward R. Handlan, in trust for certain specific purposes named in said will. Said trust was to continue for a period of twenty years.
II. On May 31, 1921, the probate court of the city of St. Louis, state of Missouri, admitted the decedent’s will, dated April 27, 1920, to probate, and appointed E. W. Handlan, A. H. Handlan, Jr., and Edward R. Handlan to be the executors thereof. Said executors duly qualified and they have never been discharged as such. During the month of September, 1932, they turned over to themselves, as trustees of the trust created under the decedent’s will, the assets of the decedent’s estate; that included in the list of the assets for which they, as trustees, receipted to themselves as executors, was the claim or right that is involved in this action; that thereafter they continued to act as trustees of said trust until July 25, 1934, in which said last-mentioned date the circuit court of the city of St. Louis, Mo., in the case of Lillian Handlan Lemp, Plaintiff, v. Alexander H. Handlan et al., Defendants, No. 185292, made and entered an order and decree, by the terms of which the above-named trustees were removed and directed to turn over all of the assets of the decedent’s es*925tate to Thomas N. Dysart, as trustee, including an assignment of the claim or right that is in suit; that pursuant to said order said trustees did turn over to Thomas N. Dysart, trustee, all of the assets belonging to sai<i trust estate.
III. The following is a list of decedent’s widow, children, and relatives who survived his death, and at the date of probate of his will were 'his heirs at law, legatees, and beneficiaries, to wit:
Name Relationship Address
Mrs. Millie A. Handlan Widow Chase Apartment, St. Louis, Mo.
Eugene W. Handlan Son Chase Apartment, St. Louis, Mo.

John J. Handlan Brother Bourbon, Mo.
Regina H. Shaw Cousin 6016 Maple Ave., St. Louis, Mo.
Eugene Young Handlan Brother 1841 Grasmere St., East Cleveland, Ohio.
IV. On May 27, 1922, the executors of the decedent’s will filed a federal estate tax return, Form 706, for the estate of Alexander H. Handlan, deceased, with the collector of internal revenue at St. Louis, Mo. The return showed a gross estate of $833,993.68, deductions aggregating $141,-720.81, and a net estate subject to federal estate tax upon the transfer thereof of $692,272.87. The tax upon the transfer of the net estate amounted to $28,036.37, and a sum equal to said tax was paid by the executors to the collector of internal revenue at St. Louis, Mo., on November 27, 1922.
V. On May 12, 1923, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue notified the executors, by letter of that date, that an investigation disclosed a total federal estate tax liability of $58,246.12, or a deficiency or additional tax in excess of the tax reported in the return of $30,209.75; $3.47 of this amount was subsequently abated. The deficiency or additional tax, less the sum of $3.47 abated, was paid by the executors to the collector of internal revenue at St. Louis, Mo., as follows, to wit:
June 13, 1923.................$ 2,409.22
November 23, 1923............ 27,797.06
Interest ...................... 1,240.64
Total payments upon tax and interest $31,446.92
The additional tax of $30,209.75 was caused, as stated in said letter of May 12, 1923, and in the letter of the Commissioner under date of August 19, 1925, by the following:
The Commissioner of Internal Revenue determined that 1,550 shares of the capital stock of the Handlan-Buck Manufacturing Company of the value of $310,000 was property transferred by the testator during his lifetime, and that said transfer was made to take effect in possession or enjoyment after death, and that the value of the property transferred was properly included as a part of the gross estate. '
The item of real estate returned by the executors was increased from $392,-172.40 to $438,176.40.
The item of $20,000, administration expense for executors’ fees, the letter of May 12, 1923, contained this statement: “No deduction is made of the amount claimed for executors’ commissions, as it appears that payment had not been made at the time this estate was under investigation.”
VI. On June 30, 1924, the executors filed a claim for refund of $27,318.26 with the collector of internal revenue at St. Louis, Mo., which contains the following assignment of error, to wit:
“The Executors base their claim for refund in this case upon the following facts:
“Alexander H. Handlan died May 28, 1921. The Executors duly made their return on Form 706 and paid the tax shown to be due thereby. On Schedule E of Form 706 the Executors showed among other things that in February, 1917, the deceased transferred to his three sons, who Ã¢ÂÂ are the Executors, a total of 1550 shares of the Capital Stock of Handlan-Buck Manufacturing Company, but the Executors did not include the value of this *926stock in the gross estate as it was the view of the Executors that the transfer of the stock was not made in contemplation of death, nor was it intended to take effect at or after death.
“On review and audit of the return on Form 706, the Department included the stock in the gross estate, appraised the stock at $200.00 per share, and assessed an additional tax on account thereof.
“Thereafter a claim for abatement was filed whereby it was claimed among other things that the estate was entitled to a deduction in the sum of $25,000.00 on account of Executors’ fees and commissions. By 'a Statement II attached to the Claim for Abatement it was shown that the amount of the Executors’ commissions had not been paid. At the hearing on the claim for Abatement the representatives of the Department stated that when the amount of the commissions was determined and the commissions were paid, the claim for refund based upon the amount of the payment would be entertained by the Department.

""The Executors’ commissions have not yet been determined or paid, and the Executors respectfully reserve the right to file further claim' for refund after the payment of the commissions.

“By the claim for abatement it was further claimed that the Department had erred in including the 1550 shares of stock of the Handlan-Buck Manufacturing company in the gross estate for the reason that the deceased made complete and irrevocable gifts of this stock to his sons more than four years prior to his death, and because these gifts were made in contemplation of, nor were they intended to take effect at or after death.
“In passing on the claim for abatement the Commissioner in his letter of November 17, 1923, said:
“ ‘The evidence in the case discloses that after the decedent had transferred the 1550 shares of the stock in the HandlanBuck Mfg. Co., all the dividends declared thereon were paid to him until his death. Under these circumstances, the Bureau is of the opinion that the transfers were intended to take effect at or after decedent’s death, and are taxable.’
“The Commissioner by said letter fixed the value of the 1550 shares of stock in question at $310,000.00. He determined the gross estate to be $1,189,293.65, the net estate to be $1,067,426.52, and the total tax to be $58,242.65. The Commissioner assessed an additional tax which the Executors paid under protest on November 23, 1923.
“It is the position of the Executors that the 1550 shares of stock valued at $310,000.00 should be excluded from the gross estate, and that upon this being done the gross estate should be determined to be $879,293.65 and the net estate $757,426.52, the total tax upon which should be $32,-094.12.
“As a result of the inclusion of the 1550 shares of stock in the gross estate, the Executors have been compelled to pay a tax of $26,148.53 with interest thereon from June 16th to November 23rd at the rate of 10% per annum, which interest amounts to $1,169.73, the total of said tax and interest being $27,318.26. The Executors allege that this amount has been collected without legal authority, and therefore present this their claim for refund. Having made specific protest at the time of payment and having paid under protest setting forth in detail the basis of and reasons for such protest, the Executors further ask that they be paid interest upon the total amount of the refund at the rate of y2 of 1% per month from November 23, 1923 the date of payment, to the date of allowance of this claim.
“The laws of Missouri impose an inheritance tax upon the property of a decedent and provide for the appraisement of the estate by an appraiser appointed by the Probate Court. After the death of Alexander H. Handlan the Probate Court of St. Louis, Missouri, being the Court in which his will was probated and which had jurisdiction of his estate, appointed the Honorable Edwin W. Lee, a lawyer and former Judge of the Circuit Court of the City of St. Louis, as the appraiser of his estate. In considering the question of the taxability of these gifts of stock, said appraiser held a hearing at which each of the Executors was sworn and examined as a witness. A copy of this testimony is already on file with the Department as Exhibit A attached to the claim for abatement. We likewise attach a copy here, marked Exhibit A, and hereby made a part of this claim for refund. A copy of the opinion of the appraiser in which he held that the stock was not subject to the Missouri Inheritance' Tax and which also is on file as Exhibit B to the claim for *927abatement, is hereto attached marked Exhibit B and made a part of this claim for refund.
“A Certificate of the Probate Court of the City of St. Louis showing that the appointment of the Executors remain in full force and effect is hereto attached and marked Exhibit C.
“A copy of the protest filed by the Executors at the time of payment of the tax is hereto attached and marked Exhibit D.

“It is respectfully submitted that the Bureau is in error in holding that the transfers were intended to take effect at or after decedent’s death, that the sum of $27,31826 has been collected without legal authority, and together with interest should be refunded to the Executors.

“The Executors respectfully request that they be allowed a hearing before the Solicitor of the Department on the legal points involved in this claim for refund.”
VII. On August 19, 1925, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue notified the executors by letter mailed to them on that date that their claim for refund was rejected.
Said letter was as follows:
“The Bureau has examined the claim, filed by you on behalf of the above-named estate, for refund of $27,318.26, Federal Estate Tax paid under the Revenue Act of 1918.
“The protest is based upon the inclusion in the gross estate of the value of property transferred by the decedent during his lifetime. The item protested, together with the amount returned and adjusted, is as follows:
Stocks and Bonds Returned Adjusted 1,550 shares Handlan-Buck Manufacturing Com- . pany .......... $0.00 $310,000.00
“This item was included in the gross estate on review in the amount of $310,000. It appears that the decedent transferred the stock to his sons, but continued to receive the income until his death. He also acted as President of the company and drew an annual salary although he had no other stock in the company. The Bureau has considered the evidence carefully and is of the .opinion that the transfer was made to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after death, and the value of the property transferred was properly included in the gross estate.
“In view of the foregoing, your claim for refund of $27,318.26 is rejected' in its entirety.”
VIII. On January 4, 1932, the Supreme Court of the State of Missouri decided that the 1,550 shares of capital stock of the Handlan-Buck Manufacturing Company belonged to the estate of Alexander H. Handlan.
IX. Arnold J. Hellmich, the collector of internal revenue at the time of the payment of the taxes herein mentioned, is not now in office 'as collector of internal revenue, and was not in office at the time this suit was brought.
Comment.
The timely filing of a claim for refund is a prerequisite to the institution of a suit to recover taxes improperly assessÃÂ©d and collected. United States v. Felt & Tarrant Manufacturing Company, 283 U.S. 269, 51 S.Ct. 376, 75 L.Ed. 1025; Moses et al. v. United States (C.C.A.) 61 F.(2d) 791; United States v. Michel, 282 U.S. 656, 657, 51 S.Ct. 284, 75 L.Ed. 598; 26 U. S.C.A. §§ 1672-1673.
 A claim for a refund need take on no particular form, and is not to be adjudged insufficient because it does not conform to the rules applicable in 'the construction of a pleading. But a claim for refund which the statute makes the prerequisite to a suit relates to the claim which the taxpayer proposes to be made the basis of the suit. The claim for refund should inform the Commissioner of the amount and nature of the demand that is being made for the return of money that it is alleged was improperly collected. United States v. Felt & Tarrant Manufacturing Company, supra.
The claim for refund filed by the executors in this case on June 30, 1924, was based upon the action of the Commissioner in treating, 1,550 shares of stock of the Handlan-Buck Manufacturing Company as a part of the gross estate. That was said to have been an error and a claim was asserted on that account. It has been judicially determined that the stock was an asset of the estate and this matter is not an issue in this suit. The failure to grant deduction on account of the executors’ commissions is involved in this action, and as *928to that the claim for refund filed expressly excluded that item from consideration by stating that, “The Executors reserve the right 'to file a further claim for refund after the payment of the commissions.” This claim for refund did not direct the attention of the Commissioner to the demand made in this suit and hence is insufficient to warrant the maintenance of this action.
In this respect, the case differs from Bull v. United States, 295 U.S. 247, 55 S.Ct. 695, 79 L.Ed. 1421, where a proper and timely claim for refund was presented.
The plaintiff filed a claim for refund relating to the inclusion of Missouri real estate on December 19, 1934. This was eleven years after the payment of the tax, and nine years after the rejection of the prior claim for refund filed by the executors on June 30, 1924. Plaintiff does not rely upon this belated filing of a claim for refund in this action, as we understand his position.
Conclusions of Law.
I. The claim for refund filed by the executors on June 30, 1924, is based upon a single specification of error, namely, “that the Bureau is in error in holding that the transfers were intended to take effect at or after decedent’s death.”
II. The claim for error assigned in the executors’ claim for refund was decided adversely to the claimants’ contention by the Supreme Court of the State of Missouri and the decision of that court is binding and conclusive with respect to said issue upon this court.
III. The defendant is entitled to a judgment dismissing the plaintiffs’ action and for its costs and disbursements herein.
Ruling on Motions Filed.
I. Defendant’s conclusion of law No. I is refused, and defendant allowed an exception.
II. Defendant’s objections to plaintiff’s request for findings of fact and conclusions of law sustained and plaintiff allowed an exception.
III. Plaintiff’s motion for judgment overruled, and defendants motion for judgment sustained, and plaintiff allowed an exception.
IV. Plaintiff is also allowed an exception to each of the findings of fact and conclusions of law made and stated by the court

   ORDER GRANTING DEFENDANTS MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
  


  JAMES I. COHN, District Judge.
 

  THIS CAUSE is before the Court upon Defendant Continental Casualty Company’s Motion for Summary Judgment [DE 19] (“Motion”). The Court has reviewed the Motion, Plaintiffs Memorandum of Law in Opposition [DE 27] (“Response”), Defendant’s Reply [DE 28] (“Reply”), the pertinent portions of the underlying record and is otherwise advised in the premises.
 

  I. BACKGROUND
 

  Plaintiff, Connie Borschel (“Borschel” or “Plaintiff’) brought this action pursuant to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, 29 U.S.C. § 1001
  
   et seq.
  
  (“ERISA”), challenging Continental Casualty Company’s (“Continental” or “Defendant”)
  
   1
  
  denial of her claim for long-term disability (“LTD”) benefits.
 

  A. The Group Long Term Disability Plan
 

  Borschel was a store manager for Kmart Corporation (“Kmart”) from July 1, 1999, until February 25, 2001.
  
   See
  
  Kmart Management Telephonic Claim, DE 20, H-55.
  
   2
  
  Borschel participated in Kmart’s employee welfare benefit plan which provided LTD coverage to eligible employees. The terms of Borschel’s LTD coverage were set forth in the Group Long Term Disability Policy and CertifÃÂ­cate issued by Continental, Policy No. SR-83099256 (the “Policy/Certificate”). Continental is the claims administrator and will pay benefits for a covered loss. Motion, DE 19, p. 1; Policy/Certificate, DE 20, H-99. When making a benefits determination under the Policy/Certificate, Continental has discretionary authority to determine the eligibility for benefits and to interpret the terms and provisions of the policy.
  
   3
  

   See
  
  Policy/Certificate, DE 20, H-104.
 

  The requirements for filing a LTD benefits claim are: (1) an initial notice of claim and (2) written Proof of Loss.
  
   See
  
  Policy/Certificate, DE 20, H 111. The initial notice of claim must be made as soon as possible and written notice of the disability must be sent within 90 days of the date of disability, or as soon as reasonably possible;
  
   Id.
  
  The necessary claim forms to complete the written Proof of Loss are provid
   
   *1296
   
  ed within 15 days of Continental being notified in writing of the claim.
  
   Id.
  
  The Proof of Loss must include a number of different items such as the date the disability began, the cause of the disability, proof that the claimant is receiving “Appropriate and Regular Care” for the condition from a doctor, and documentation of the claimant’s monthly earnings.
  
   See
  
  Policy/Certificate, DE 20, H 111-112 for the complete list of items required. The claimant is also required to provide Continental with additional information including a signed authorization for Continental to obtain and release all reasonably necessary medical, financial or other non-medical information which supports the claim.
  
   See
  
  Policy/Certificate, DE 20, H-112. When applicable, the claimant must also provide proof that the claimant applied for other Deductible Income Benefits such as Workers’ Compensation or Social Security Disability Benefits.
  
   Id.
  
  The claimant is also required to notify Continental when he/she is awarded other Deductible Income Benefits.
  
   Id.
  


  The time limit for making a claim under the Policy/CertifÃÂ­cate is as follows:
 

  The time limit for filing Your claim is that You must furnish Us with written proof of loss within 90 days after the end of Your Elimination Period. The length of the Elimination Period is stated in the Summary of Benefits section of the policy. If it is not possible to give Us written proof within 90 days, the claim is not affected if the proof is given as soon as possible. However, unless You are legally incapacitated, written proof of loss must be given no later than 1 year after the time proof is otherwise due.
 

  No benefits are payable for claims submitted more than 1 year after the time proof is due. However, You can request that benefits be paid for late claims if You can show that:
 

  1. It was not reasonably possible to give written proof during the 1 year period, and
 

  2. Proof of loss satisfactory to Us was given as soon as was reasonably possible.
 


   See
  
  Policy/Certificate, DE 20, H 111. The Elimination Period is defined as “a period of continuous Disability which must be satisfied before You are eligible to receive benefits from Us. You must be continuously Disabled through Your Elimination Period.” Policy/Certificate, DE 20, H 106. The Elimination Period begins on the day you become disabled and lasts 180 days or the end of the Short Term Disability Maximum Period Payable, whichever is greater.
  
   See
  
  Summary of Benefits, DE 20, H 101; Policy/Certificate, DE 20, H 106.
 

  B. Continental’s Denial of Long Term Disability Benefits
 

  Borschel ceased working for Kmart on February 26, 2001 because she suffered from fatigue, stress, joint pain and other symptoms.
  
   See
  
  Kmart Management, Telephonic Claim, DE 20, H-54. She made a claim for short-term disability (“STD”) benefits but the benefits were not approved beyond May 25, 2001.
  
   See
  
  Response, DE 27, Ex. B. Continental determined that even though Borschel was diagnosed with Job Stress, Anxiety, Mild Sleep Apnea and Menopause, the medical information presented failed to explain her inability to continue working and she did not meet the STD policy definition of “Non-Occupational Disability.”
  
   Id.
  
  The denial of Borschel’s STD benefits was litigated in
  
   Borschel v. Continental Casualty Co. and K-Mart Corporation Short Term Disability Plan,
  
  Case No. 04-60447-Civ-Graham (the “2004 case”), but ultimately the STD benefits claim was resolved in a Settlement Agreement and Release fully executed on February 4, 2005.
  
   4
  


 
   *1297
   
  Continental takes the position that Bor-sehel did not make a claim for LTD benefits until April 28, 2006, when her counsel wrote Continental stating “[pjlease allow this letter to serve as my client’s formal request that the long-term disability benefits be paid as required by the subject policy.”
  
   See
  
  Letter from Mr. Berger, DE 20, H-13-14. On June 22, 2006, Continental denied Borschel’s claim for LTD benefits on two grounds: (1) The 2005 Settlement Agreement and General Release between Borschel and Kmart extinguished any and all claims by Borschel against any welfare-benefit plan sponsored by Kmart, including the LTD plan
  
   5
  
  and (2) Borschel’s claim was untimely due to the delay in providing the notice of claim and written proof of loss.
  
   See
  
  Letter to Mr. Berger, DE 20, H-01.
 

  II. ANALYSIS
 

  A. Summary Judgment Standard
 

  The Court may grant summary judgment “if the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). The movant “bears the initial responsibility of informing the district court of the basis for its motion, and identifying those portions of [the record] which it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.”
  
   Celotex Corp. v. Catrett,
  
  477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). To discharge this burden, the movant must point out to the Court that there is an absence of evidence to support the non-moving party’s case.
  
   Id.
  
  at 325, 106 S.Ct. 2548.
 

  After the movant has met its burden under Rule 56(c), the burden of production shifts and the nonmoving party “must do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts.”
  
   Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp.,
  
  475 U.S. 574, 586, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986). According to the plain language of Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(e), the non-moving party “may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of the adverse party’s pleadings,” but instead must come forward with “specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.” Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e);
  
   Matsushita,
  
  475 U.S. at 587, 106 S.Ct. 1348.
 

  Essentially, so long as the non-moving party has had an ample opportunity to conduct discovery, it must come forward with affirmative evidence to support its claim.
  
   Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc.,
  
  477 U.S. 242, 257, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). “A mere ‘scintilla’ of evidence supporting the opposing party’s position will not suffice; there must be a sufficient showing that the jury could reasonably find for that party.”
  
   Walker v. Darby,
  
  911 F.2d 1573, 1577 (11th Cir.1990). If the evidence advanced by the non-moving party “is merely colorable, or is not significantly probative, then summary judgment may be granted.”
  
   Anderson, 477
  
  U.S. at 249-50, 106 S.Ct. 2505.
 

  B. ERISA Standard of Review
 

  In the Eleventh Circuit, reviewing a decision to deny benefits is broken down into six steps:
 

  (1) Apply the
  
   de novo
  
  standard to determine whether the claim administrator’s benefits-denial decision is “wrong” (i.e., the court disagrees with the administrator’s decision); if it is not, then end the inquiry and affirm the decision.
 

 
   *1298
   
  (2)If the administrator’s decision in fact is “de novo wrong,” then determine whether he was vested with discretion in reviewing claims; if not, end judicial inquiry and reverse the decision.
 

  (8) If the administrator’s decision is “de novo wrong” and he
  
   was
  
  vested with discretion in reviewing claims, then determine whether “reasonable” grounds supported it (hence, review his decision under the more deferential arbitrary and capricious standard).
 

  (4) If no reasonable grounds exist, then end the inquiry and reverse the administrator’s decision; if reasonable grounds do exist, then determine if he operated under a conflict of interest.
 

  (5) If there is no conflict, then end the inquiry and affirm the decision.
 

  (6) If there is a conflict of interest, then apply heightened arbitrary and capricious review to the decision to affirm or deny it.
 


   Doyle v. Liberty Life Assurance Co. of Boston,
  
  511 F.3d 1336, 1340 (11th Cir.2008)
  
   (citing Williams v. BellSouth Telecomms., Inc.,
  
  373 F.3d 1132, 1138 (11th Cir.2004)).
 

  Therefore, the Court must first apply the
  
   de novo
  
  standard to determine whether Continental’s benefits-denial decision was “wrong.” The central issue is the date Borschel made a LTD benefits claim. Continental asserts that Borschel made no claim for LTD benefits until April 28, 2006, well after the November 26, 2002 deadline for filing a LTD benefits claim under the Policy/Certificate. Therefore, Continental argues that its denial was legally correct and Continental is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.
 

  Borschel asserts that Continental chose to ignore its fiduciary duty to Plaintiff and did not timely review her claim for LTD benefits, despite the fact that it had received sufficient medical records to support her entitlement to the benefits.
  
   See
  
  Response, DE 27, p. 2. Borschel alleges that due to Continental’s improper termination of Plaintiffs short term benefits, Continental never addressed her entitlement to long term disability benefits.
  
   Id.,
  
  at p. 4. Further, Borschel’s attorney corresponded with Continental on February 12, 2002, and advised Continental that he represented Borschel regarding the wrongful termination of her short-term benefits as well as the wrongful denial of her long-term benefits.
  
   See
  
  Response, DE 27, Ex. C. Additional correspondence occurred between counsel for Plaintiff and Continental, including an alleged statement by Continental on February 18, 2002, that “it would not proceed with the long-term disability claim,” as well as a representative stating that “Plaintiffs short-term disability benefits were terminated and therefore she did not enter the long-term disability period.”
  
   See
  
  Response, DE 27, p. 6, and Ex. G.
 

  Borschel fails to cite any legal authority that would substantiate a finding that her counsel’s correspondence with Continental in 2002 established a LTD benefits claim. Borschel also appears to assume that a LTD benefits claim had already been made and her attorney was simply providing additional support for the LTD benefits determination. However, Borschel does not sufficiently explain how she complied with the procedures in the Policy/Certificate to file a claim for LTD benefits.
 

  Borschel’s disability began on February 26, 2001.
  
   See
  
  Kmart Management, Telephonic Claim, DE 20, H 54-55. Borschel was then required to provide Continental with written proof of loss within 90 days after the end of the elimination period. Certificate/Policy, DE 20, H-lll. Bor-schel’s elimination period began the day she became disability and continued for 180 days.
  
   See
  
  Summary of Benefits, DE 20, H 101; Policy/Certificate, DE 20, H
   
   *1299
   
  106. Adding the additional 90 days after the elimination period means that Borschel should have filed a claim for LTD benefits by November 23, 2001. However, she had until one year after the time proof was due to submit a claim; therefore, Borschel would not be paid for any LTD benefits claim filed after November 23, 2002.
  
   See
  
  Policy/Certificate, H-lll.
 

  Borschel’s argument that the 2002 correspondence created or supported a claim for LTD benefits is belied by U.S. District Judge Graham’s August 14, 2004 Order in the 2004 case.
  
   See
  
  Reply, DE 28, Ex. 1;
  
   see also ITT Rayonier Incorporated v. U.S.,
  
  651 F.2d 343, 345, fn. 2 (5th Cir.1981) (“[a] court may ... take judicial notice of its own records or of those of inferior courts.”)
  
   6
  
  In the 2004 case, Bor-schel made a similar argument that, based on the 2002 correspondence, it was evident that a claim- for STD
  
   and
  
  LTD benefits were sought for review.
  
   See Borschel v. Continental Cas. Co., and Kmart Corp. Short Term Disability Plan,
  
  Case no. 04-60447-CIV-GRAHAM, Plaintiffs Response in Opposition to Defendant’s Continental Casualty Company, Motion to Dismiss, DE 12, p. 3 (Counsel for Borschel forwarded correspondence dated February, 12, 2002; February 18, 2002; February 19, 2002 and July 15, 2002, taking the position that sufficient information was provided to support a claim for both short-term and long-term disability benefits.) However, Judge Graham found that Borschel conceded that “she failed to exhaust her administrative remedies because she never pursued a claim for long-term disability benefits with Continental.”
  
   See
  
  Reply, DE 28, Ex. 1, p. 3. The Judge went on to state that Continental never had the opportunity to determine whether Borschel was entitled to LTD benefits “because Borschel has never filed any administrative claim requiring such consideration.”
  
   Id.,
  
  at p. 4.
 

  Therefore, as of August 14, 2004, Bor-schel was on notice that she had not made a proper LTD benefits claim. In light of this prior judicial determination, Bor-schel’s attempt to revive her argument concerning the 2002 correspondence is unavailing. The Court advised Plaintiff that as of August 2004 she had not filed a LTD benefits claim. Had Plaintiff acted quickly after the August 2004 Order to file a LTD benefits claim, the analysis of the timeliness of the claim might be different. However, based upon the documentation provided, it was not until April 28, 2006, over a year and one half after the August 2004 Order, that a claim for LTD benefits was actually made.
 

  Borschel also appears to argue that her eligibility for LTD benefits was not ripe until a final determination of her STD benefits claim was made.
  
   See
  
  Letter from Mr. Berger, DE 20, H-13 (“[a]s a follow up to my client’s resolution of the short-term disability claim with K-Mart, I am enclosing ... medical records relating to Ms. Borschel’s claim for Long-Term Disability benefits ... ”) In the beginning, Plaintiff may have justifiably relied on the correspondence in 2002 that her LTD benefits claim was not ripe. However, after the 2004 Order, such reliance was unreasonable because there was a judicial determination that no LTD benefits claim had been made. Additionally, the entitlement to STD benefits and LTD benefits are governed by separate documents and the

  only document before this Court is the Policy/Certificate governing LTD benefits claims. Borschel has provided no legal basis for finding that the dispute over her STD benefits claim stayed the deadline for filing a LTD benefits claim..
 

  Continental states that any attempt by Borschel to rely on Florida’s state law ‘notice-prejudice rule’ must fail. Motion, DE 19, p. 9-10;
  
   see also UNUM Life Ins. Co. of Am. v. Ward,
  
  526 U.S. 358, 119 S.Ct. 1380, 143 L.Ed.2d 462 (1999) (California notice-prejudice rule is not preempted by ERISA). Under Florida law, an untimely claim “creates the presumption that the insurer was prejudiced by the untimeliness ... [t]he insured then has the opportunity to rebut the presumption that the insurer was prejudiced.”
  
   Lane v. Provident Life and Acc. Ins. Co.,
  
  178 F.Supp.2d 1281, 1287-1288 (S.D.Fla.2001). Therefore, under the notice-prejudice rule, Borschel would bear the burden of rebutting the presumption that Continental was prejudiced by the untimely LTD benefits claim. Borschel alleges that Continental was not prejudiced because Plaintiff provided her medical records years before April 2006, but Continental failed to exercise its fiduciary duties and investigate whether Plaintiff was disabled per the definition in the Policy/Certificate. As a result, Continental “must be estopped from denying the Plaintiff, Borschel, her rightfully owed long-term disability benefits.”
  
   7
  
  Response, DE 27, p. 8.
 

  Borschel does not address the presumption of prejudice. For example, she does not respond to Continental’s allegation that the extended passage of time between the alleged onset of total disability in 2001 and the claim- in 2006 deprived Continental of a meaningful opportunity to make its own preliminary investigation. Continental specifically argues that the delay precluded it from being able to arrange for an independent medical examination when Borschel allegedly became eligible for the LTD benefits.
  
   See
  
  Motion, DE 19, p. 9-10. Additionally, providing medical records does not obviate the need to abide by the established procedure in the Policy/Certificate for filing a claim. No claim for LTD benefits was made until 2006 even though the injury occurred in 2001 and a LTD benefits claim was required by 2002. The delay in filing the claim precluded Continental from being able to conduct a contemporaneous investigation when Bor-schel allegedly became eligible for LTD benefits.
  
   8
  
  Therefore, Borschel failed to demonstrate that Continental was not in a substantially worse position than it would have been had Borschel complied with the
   
   *1301
   
  notice requirement.
  
   See Lane,
  
  178 F.Supp.2d at 1288-1289.
 

  The April 2006 claim for LTD benefits is well after any of the pertinent deadlines in the Policy/Certificate. Borschel has presented no evidence that she was legally incapable of submitting her claim in a timely fashion and she can take no refuge in the notice-prejudice rule because she has not rebutted the presumption of prejudice by her untimely claim. Accordingly, Continental’s determination that Plaintiff was not entitled to LTD benefits was not
  
   de novo wrong.
  
  No grounds exist to disturb Continental’s benefits-denial decision, and a further determination under any of the other ERISA review standards is unnecessary. Continental is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law.
 

  III. CONCLUSION
 

  Having found as a matter of law that Continental’s decision to deny benefits was not
  
   de novo
  
  wrong, pursuant to Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Court enters Summary Judgment in favor of Continental Casualty Company. The Final Judgment shall be entered separately.
 

  Based on the foregoing, it is hereby ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that Continental Casualty Company’s Motion for Summary Judgment [DE 19] is GRANTED.

   . While Borschel uses the term 'estopped', she does not allege a claim for estoppel and has cited no legal authority for an estoppel argument. Continental cites
   
    Umano v. W.C. Robinson & Assoc., Inc.,
   
   352 F.Supp.2d 1259, 1265 (S.D.Fla.2004), arguing that since Bor-schel does not allege an ambiguity in the Policy/Certificate, nor any oral interpretation of such ambiguity, she has no recourse to the estoppel theory. Reply, DE 28, p. 5-6. The Court agrees. Borschel has not pled sufficient facts to substantiate the application of the estoppel theory. In particular, Borschel has not alleged any ambiguity in the LTD Policy/Certificate.
   
    See Katz v. Comprehensive Plan of Group Insurance, Alltell,
   
   197 F.3d 1084, 1090-1091 (11th Cir.1999) (term unambiguous therefore equitable estoppel unavailable). Continental also argues that to the extent that Borschel seeks equitable tolling of the claim filing deadlines, it must be denied. The Court finds that Borschel has made no argument for equitable tolling, therefore, the Court need not address this issue.
  


   8
  

   . Borschel submitted her LTD benefits claim in 2006. Therefore, one could infer that she continues to be disabled and is presumably available for a medical evaluation. However, this does not address the issue of presumption of prejudice to Continental in its ability to decide the eligibility of her disability in 2001-2002.

6076608,6210028,62570840,Miazga v. Assaf,"Robert A. Miazga, Appellant-Respondent v. Michael D. Assaf","
Clark, J.
(1) Cross appeal from an order of the Supreme Court (Walsh, J.), entered September 19, 2014 in Albany County, which, among other things, partially granted defendants’ motion for summary judgment, and (2) appeal from an order of said court, entered March 20, 2015 in Albany County, which denied plaintiff’s motion for, among other things, reconsideration.
Plaintiff retained defendants in January 2011 to represent him in a custody proceeding and, thereafter, in a divorce action. In April 2012, after a breakdown in the parties’ relationship, defendant Michael D. Assaf requested that defendants be relieved as plaintiff’s counsel and, after a hearing, the application to withdraw was granted. Plaintiff proceeded pro se in his divorce action and custody proceeding and, thereafter, commenced this action against defendants. In his complaint, plaintiff alleges, among other things, nine causes of action with respect to defendants’ representation, including, among other things, breach of a fiduciary duty, legal malpractice, defama*1132tion and breach of contract. Defendants asserted a counterclaim for, among other things, unpaid legal fees. Defendants moved for summary judgment dismissing the complaint, which plaintiff opposed. Plaintiff also cross-moved seeking partial judgment on the issue of liability for the disclosure of an allegedly privileged/confidential email, among other things. Supreme Court granted defendants’ motion for summary judgment with respect to plaintiff’s claims of legal malpractice and breach of a fiduciary duty, fraud, defamation and failure to communicate, but denied the motion regarding plaintiff’s breach of contract claim with respect to defendants’ billing rates. Supreme Court also denied plaintiff’s cross motion. Plaintiff then moved to reargue and/or renew, in addition to moving for Supreme Court’s recusal. Supreme Court denied plaintiff’s motion, adhering to its original order. Plaintiff now appeals from both orders,1 and defendants cross-appeal from that part of Supreme Court’s order as denied their motion for summary judgment dismissing the complaint.2 We affirm both orders.
We initially reject plaintiff’s claim that summary judgment was premature inasmuch as depositions had not yet been completed at the time of the motion practice (see Hobler v Hussain, 111 AD3d 1006, 1009 [2013]; Saratoga Assoc. Landscape Architects, Architects, Engrs. & Planners, P.C. v Lauter Dev. Group, 77 AD3d 1219, 1222 [2010]) and, turning to defendants’ motion for summary judgment itself, agree with Supreme Court that defendants were entitled to the dismissal of certain causes of action.
Addressing plaintiff’s defamation claim first, it is well settled that “statements made by counsel and parties in the course of judicial proceedings are privileged as long as such statements are material and pertinent to the questions involved,” and, as such, they cannot be the basis of a defamation cause of action (Wiener v Weintraub, 22 NY2d 330, 331 [1968] [internal quotation marks and citation omitted]; see Capoccia v Couch, 134 *1133AD2d 806, 807 [1987], appeal dismissed 71 NY2d 1022 [1988]). “No action for defamation exists unless the statement is . . . so needlessly defamatory as to warrant the inference of express malice and a motivation solely to defame” (Grasso v Mathew, 164 AD2d 476, 479 [1991], lv dismissed 77 NY2d 940 [1991], lv denied 78 NY2d 855 [1991]; see Dworkin v State of New York, 34 AD3d 1014, 1014-1015 [2006]).3
Here, on April 25, 2012, plaintiff sent Assaf an email indicating that their relationship was at an impasse and aired various grievances with Assafs representation. On May 11, 2012, May 15, 2012 and May 17, 2012, the parties separately sent letters to Supreme Court regarding Assafs continued representation of plaintiff. In his letters, Assaf discussed his belief that plaintiff’s claims against him were false and, by way of order to show cause, moved Supreme Court to relieve him of further obligations to plaintiff. In support of his request, Assaf submitted plaintiff’s email for consideration by Supreme Court.4 Given that the correspondence was relevant and pertinent to the then-pending litigation, we agree that it is shielded by the judicial proceedings privilege and cannot serve as the basis of plaintiff’s defamation cause of action. Accordingly, Supreme Court correctly dismissed plaintiff’s defamation claim.
Turning our attention to plaintiff’s claims of legal malpractice, in order to succeed on such a cause of action, the plaintiff must demonstrate that an attorney failed to exercise the ordinary and reasonable skill and knowledge that a member of the legal profession possesses (see Darby & Darby v VSI Intl., 95 NY2d 308, 313 [2000]; Levine v Horton, 127 AD3d 1395, 1397 [2015]; Geraci v Munnelly, 85 AD3d 1361, 1362 [2011]). The plaintiff must also establish that the attorney’s breach of this duty proximately caused actual and ascertainable damages (see Rudolf v Shayne, Dachs, Stanisci, Corker & Sauer, 8 NY3d 438, 442 [2007]; Schrowang v Biscone, 128 AD3d 1162, 1162-1163 [2015]), and show that he or she would have been successful on the merits of the underlying action but for the defendant’s negligence (see Levine v Horton, 127 AD3d at 1397). Thus, to succeed on their motion for summary judgment, de*1134fendants must “present evidence in admissible form establishing that plaintiff is unable to prove at least one of these elements” (Ehlinger v Ruberti, Girvin & Ferlazzo, 304 AD2d 925, 926 [2003]; see Sevey v Friedlander, 83 AD3d 1226, 1226 [2011], lv denied 17 NY3d 707 [2011]).
Here, defendants have sufficiently demonstrated that plaintiff was unable to prove actual and ascertainable damages relating to Assaf s representation. Specifically, in the affirmation in support of the motion for summary judgment, defense counsel points out that, despite repeated requests, plaintiff never produced evidence supporting the damages that he specified in his bill of particulars and, therefore, failed to show that any such losses occurred. As such, we agree that defendants carried their burden of producing competent evidence sufficient to shift the burden to plaintiff to raise a triable issue of fact. For his part, plaintiff claims that he incurred damages including, but not limited to, $55,000 in fees to defendants, payment of experts, $20,000 in expenses, an unspecified amount of lost income and the amount of money “expended to overcome [defendants’] actions.” However, absent any proof of same in the record, these statements remain speculative assertions, which are insufficient to defeat a motion for summary judgment (see Place v Grand Union Co., 184 AD2d 817, 817 [1992]).5 Thus, plaintiff failed to meet his shifted burden.
Further, setting aside plaintiff’s inability to raise an issue of fact with respect to the element of damages, summary judgment remains an appropriate remedy here inasmuch as plaintiff is also unable to sufficiently demonstrate that he would have been successful on the merits of his underlying action. In support of his opposition, plaintiff provided an affirmation by an expert, who stated that it is “arguable” that the custody matter would have been resolved more quickly had depositions occurred earlier. However, the expert could not state that plaintiff would have been ultimately successful. Thus, because plaintiff failed to produce evidence suggesting that, but for Assafs actions or inaction, the underlying matrimonial litigation would have resulted in a more favorable outcome (see Marchell v Littman, 107 AD3d 1082, 1084 [2013], lv denied 22 NY3d 856 [2013]; Sevey v Friedlander, 83 AD3d at *11351227), Supreme Court properly granted defendants’ motion for summary judgment with respect to plaintiff’s legal malpractice claim.
We likewise find no error in Supreme Court’s dismissal of plaintiff’s claims for breach of fiduciary duty as duplicative of his legal malpractice causes of action. In the event that a claim “arises out of the same facts as an asserted legal malpractice cause of action and does not allege distinct damages,” that claim is deemed “duplicative of the malpractice claim” (DiTondo v Meagher, 85 AD3d 1385, 1385 [2011]; see Hyman v Burgess, 125 AD3d 1213, 1215 [2015]). Here, plaintiff fails to distinguish the basis of his malpractice and breach of fiduciary duty causes of action. At its core, plaintiff’s breach of fiduciary duty cause of action lies in Assafs disclosure of plaintiff’s email to Supreme Court. However, given that part of plaintiff’s legal malpractice claim includes the email disclosure — as per the language of plaintiff’s complaint — this allegation is subsumed under plaintiff’s legal malpractice claim. Thus, because plaintiff’s claims all arise out of the same allegations and facts, we find that Supreme Court properly dismissed plaintiff’s breach of fiduciary duty claim as duplicative of his legal malpractice claim (see Sutch v Sutch-Lenz, 129 AD3d 1141, 1144 [2015]; DiTondo v Meagher, 85 AD3d at 1386).6 Furthermore, plaintiff’s claims of breach of fiduciary duty likewise suffer from the same deficiencies as his legal malpractice claims inasmuch as plaintiff is unable to adequately demonstrate causation or actual damages so as to survive a motion for summary judgment.
We do, however, agree with plaintiff that Supreme Court was correct in denying defendants’ summary judgment motion on plaintiff’s sixth cause of action for excessive fees. “Public policy dictates that courts pay particular attention to fee arrangements between attorneys and their clients, as it is important that a fee contract be fair, reasonable, and fully known and understood by the client” (Seth Rubenstein, P.C. v Ganea, 41 AD3d 54, 60 [2007] [citations omitted]). Although defendants may have submitted sufficient proof to demonstrate entitlement to judgment as a matter of law in the first instance, plaintiff provided sufficient evidence in opposition to raise a triable issue of fact with respect to defendants’ billing practices. Thus, summary judgment was properly denied on this one cause of action.
*1136Plaintiffs remaining contentions, to the extent that they are properly before us, have been considered and found to be without merit.
Garry, J.P., Rose, Lynch and Devine, JJ., concur.
Ordered that the orders are affirmed, without costs.

. By way of his reply brief, plaintiff has withdrawn the fraud count. Therefore, Supreme Court’s dismissal of plaintiff’s fraud claim will not be addressed as part of the decision herein. Additionally, in his appellate briefs, plaintiff does not address the portion of Supreme Court’s order that denied his cross motion to strike defendants’ affirmative defense with respect to lack of confidentiality or to compel discovery. Given that plaintiff did not raise these issues in his briefs or dispute Supreme Court’s decision with respect to these motions, such claims are abandoned (see Salzer v Benderson Dev. Co., LLC, 130 AD3d 1226, 1227 n 1 [2015]; Boots v Bette & Cring, LLC, 124 AD3d 1119, 1119 n 1 [2015]).


. These appeals have been consolidated.


. Moreover, the Rules of Professional Conduct governing attorneys enumerates that “[a] lawyer may reveal or use confidential information to the extent that the lawyer reasonably believes necessary ... to defend the lawyer or the lawyer’s employees and associates against an accusation of wrongful conduct” (Rules of Professional Conduct [22 NYCRR 1200.0] rule 1.6 [b] [5] [i]).


. We note that our review of the record supports Assafs position that plaintiff’s email was not disclosed to anyone other than Supreme Court.


. Plaintiff’s seventh cause of action alleges that Assaf failed to communicate with him resulting in unspecified damages. Supreme Court dismissed this cause of action under the same analysis as plaintiff’s legal malpractice claim. Plaintiff did not raise the dismissal of this cause of action on appeal and, therefore, has abandoned this claim (see Salzer v Benderson Dev. Co., LLC, 130 AD3d at 1227 n 1; Boots v Bette & Cring, LLC, 124 AD3d at 1119 n 1).


. Plaintiff sets forth allegations in his eighth and ninth causes of action that Supreme Court also correctly characterized as duplicative of plaintiff’s legal malpractice claim and properly dismissed (see Sutch v Sutch-Lenz, 129 AD3d at 1144; DiTondo v Meagher, 85 AD3d at 1386).

257687,257687,185265,United States v. Carless Russell Barnhill,"UNITED STATES of America, Plaintiff-Appellee, v. Carless Russell BARNHILL, Defendant-Appellant","

  SHACKELFORD MILLER, Jr., Chief Judge.
 

  Appellant was found guilty by a jury under a single count indictment charging possession of whiskey in unstamped containers, in violation of Sections 5205 (a) (2) and 5604(a) (1), Title 26 United States Code. He received a sentence of a year and a day. His motion for a new trial was overruled and this appeal followed.
 

  He complains first of a supplemental instruction given by the District Judge to the jury under the following circumstances. The jury retired to consider its verdict at 12:34 P.M. on Friday, October 28. It returned to the courtroom at 1:05 P.M. with the foreman reporting, “We are hopelessly deadlocked.” The District Judge gave a supplemental instruction on the importance of reaching a verdict, following which he ad
   
   *165
   
  journed court until 9:00 A.M. Monday, October 31. The jury resumed its deliberations on Monday at 9:00 A.M. and returned a verdict of guilty at 10:54 A.M.
 

  Appellant contends that by reason of the short period of time the jury had been out and the language used in the supplemental instruction, the jury was coerced in reaching a verdict of guilty. It will be noticed that the District Judge did not send for the jury and then give the supplemental instruction, but that the instruction was given after the
  
   jury
  
  on its own initiative advised the Court it was hopelessly deadlocked. Under the circumstances, the District Judge could have dismissed the jury or have instructed them to return to the jury room and give further consideration to reaching a verdict. Obviously, the period of deliberation had been too short to require as a matter of law that the jury be dismissed. A supplemental instruction was the normal and proper way to handle the matter. The shortness of the time interval was the action of the jury, not chargeable to the trial judge.
 

  The supplemental instruction stressed the importance of reaching a verdict and the duty of each individual juror to listen to the views of the other members of the jury and to give them due weight and consideration in attempting to arrive at a verdict. He stated that some jury was going to have to decide the issue and that it might as well be this jury. However, he also stated that each juror had the right to his own convictions and if it developed that they could not agree, he would declare a mistrial and submit the issue to another jury. We are of the opinion that the supplemental instruction complied with the standards approved by the United States Supreme Court in Allen v. United States, 164 U.S. 492, 501, 17 S.Ct. 154, 41 L.Ed. 528. Logsdon v. United States, 253 F.2d 12, 15-16, C.A.6; Wilson v. Southern Farm Bureau Casualty Co., 275 F.2d 819, 822-823, C.A.5; Railway Express Agency v. Mackay, 181 F.2d 257, 262-263, C.A.8; United States v. Upchurch, 286 F.2d 516, 518, C.A.4; John Fabick Tractor Co. v. Lizza & Sons, Inc., 298 F.2d 63, 65, C.A.2.
 

  It also appears that appellant did not object to the supplemental instruction, as required by Rule 51, Rules of Criminal Procedure, 18 U.S.C., but in fact offered a supplemental instruction of his own, the substance of which was given by the Court. Under the circumstances, we do not find plain error affecting appellant’s substantial rights, which we are authorized to consider under Rule 52(b), Rules of Criminal Procedure. Petro v. United States, 210 F.2d 49, 50, C.A.6, cert. denied, 347 U.S. 974, 978, 74 S.Ct. 785, 98 L.Ed. 1114; Huffman v. United States, 297 F.2d 754, 755, C.A.5.
 

  Appellant also based his motion for a new trial on the allegation that he was deprived of a fair trial because a government witness testified incorrectly about a material matter by reason of having misunderstood a question asked by appellant’s attorney, and that if he had correctly understood the question he would have testified differently. In his brief on this appeal appellant’s attorney poses as the question for our determination “Should the District Court order a new trial when a government witness
  
   recants
  
  his testimony on a material issue?” (Emphasis added.) His argument is based upon that theory of the issue involved. The government witness testified at the hearing on the motion for a new trial, and in our opinion did not recant his previous testimony at the trial. It is true that his testimony at the trial differed from that given by other government agents with whom he worked in making the arrest. On the hearing he admitted this difference and the possibility that his testimony was not a correct statement of what happened, but he stated that his testimony was in accordance with his recollection of what happened. His testimony does not indicate that if a new trial was granted he would in any material way testify differently from what he said at the original trial. The factual situation is thus materially different from that in Martin
   
   *166
   
  v. United States, 17 F.2d 973, C.A.5, relied upon by appellant, in which the so-called recanting witness stated in an affidavit “that all of said testimony was false and untrue, and now wishes to correct it.” In our opinion there was no abuse of discretion on the part of the District Judge in overruling the motion for a new trial on this ground. Gordon v. United States, 178 F.2d 896, 900, C.A. 6th, cert. denied, 339 U.S. 935, 70 S.Ct. 664, 94 L.Ed. 1353; Winer v. United States, 228 F.2d 944, 952, C.A.6, cert. denied, 351 U.S. 906, 76 S.Ct. 695, 100 L.Ed. 1442.
 

  The judgment is affirmed.

5094776,5267458,60598513,Patrick v. Clark Oil & Refining Co.,"Francis J. Patrick, Employee, Deborah L. PATRICK, Dependent-Appellant v. CLARK OIL & REFINING CO., Employer-Respondent, and National Union Fire Insurance Co., Insurer-Respondent, and Missouri State Treasurer as Custodian Of The Second Injury Fund","
SHRUM, Judge.
This is a workers’ compensation ease that presents two questions:
*415(1) Was the Labor and Industrial Relations Commission (Commission) correct when it ruled that § 287.220.91 (the dual employment statute that implicates the Second Injury Fund) was substantive and not susceptible to retroactive application as Claimant contends?
(2) Did the Commission err when it computed Employee’s average weekly wage?
We answer “yes” to both questions. We affirm in part; we reverse and remand in part.
FACTS
Francis Patrick (Employee) held two employments at the time of his death on August 5, 1998. He had a full-time job as a route salesman for M & M Enterprises. Employee also worked part time for Clark Oil and Refining (Clark) as a convenience store clerk. His job with Clark started on July 22, 1993. Less than two weeks later, on August 5, 1993, at approximately 12:01 a.m., a robber shot and killed Employee while he was at work in Clark’s store.
Deborah Patrick (Claimant), the widow of Employee, sought workers’ compensation benefits from Clark. She also asserted a claim against the Second Injury Fund (Fund) on the theory that she was entitled to additional death benefits pursuant to § 287.220.9, the dual employment statute.
After an evidentiary hearing, an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) ruled that § 287.220.9 (which was not effective until August 28, 1993) could not be applied retroactively because it was substantive. Consequently, the ALJ’s award did not include benefits from the Fund.
The ALJ found that § 287.250.3 was the “proper section to apply in this situation” and concluded that the proper average weekly wage was $189.38. From that finding, the ALJ ruled that Claimant’s weekly compensation amount was $126.25.
Claimant sought Commission review of the ALJ’s decision. The Commission affirmed the ALJ’s decision that § 287.220.9 was substantive and could not be applied retroactively to give Claimant benefits from the Fund. However, the Commission ruled that the ALJ was wrong in using § 287.250.3 to determine Employee’s “average weekly wage.” The Commission found that § 287.250.1(5) applied. It concluded that Clark had agreed to an hourly wage of $4.50. With that as its premise, the Commission computed Claimant’s weekly death benefit as $88.49. This appeal followed.
DISCUSSION AND DECISION

Point III: Is Dual Employment Statute Substantive or Remedial

Claimant’s third point focuses on the dual employment provision of § 287.220.9. Summarized, § 287.220.9 provides that if an employee with two employers sustains a work related injury, “the employer for whom the employee was working when the injury was sustained shall be responsible for wage loss benefits applicable only to the earnings in that employer’s employment....” The injured employee could file with the Fund “for any additional wage loss benefits attributed to loss of earnings from the [second] employment ...,” but in any event, recovery could not exceed the rate allowed by law on the date of injury.
Claimant concedes that the effective date of § 287.220.9 was August 28, 1993, twenty-three days after Employee was killed. She insists, however, that the Commission erred when it did not award benefits from the Fund via § 287.220.9 as this is a remedial provision that can and should be applied retroactively. We disagree.
In Stark v. Missouri State Treasurer, 954 S.W.2d 645 (Mo.App.1997), the western district held that § 287.220.9 is substantive as it creates a new standard for involving Second Injury Fund liability.
‘“The general rule is that statutes are not applied retroactively.’ In re Estate of Wilkinson, 843 S.W.2d 377, 382 (Mo.App.1992); Article I, Section 13, Mo. Const. Exceptions to the rule are when the legislature ‘shows an intent for retroactive application,’ or “where the statute is pro*416cedural only and does not affect any substantive rights of the parties.’ Wilkinson, 843 S.W.2d at 382. A substantive law relates to rights and duties giving rise to the cause of action, while procedural statutes supply the machinery used to effect the suit. Wilkes v. Missouri Highway and Transportation Comm’n, 762 S.W.2d 27 (Mo.banc 1988); Fletcher v. Second Injury Fund, 922 S.W.2d 402, 407-08 (Mo.App.1996).”

“As the Administrative Law Judge pointed out, prior to this [1993] amendment [to § 287.220], an injured person had no claim against the Fund for second job wage loss benefits. The amendment did not fine tune an existing right — it created a new cause of action. As such, it is substantive in nature and not susceptible to retroactive application.” (emphasis supplied).
Id. at 647.
This court agrees with the western district. We hold the 1993 amendment that authorized benefits from the Fund for a second employment is substantive rather than remedial. The Commission did not err when it refused to apply § 287.220.9 retroactively and order payment of benefits from the Fund for an accident that occurred August 5,1993.
In reaching this conclusion, we do not ignore Claimant’s argument that the very nature of workers’ compensation law is remedial and therefore retroactive. However, this argument overlooks the fact that Missouri courts have frequently held amendments to the Workers’ Compensation Act to be substantive. Stark is such a case. Other examples are cases holding that the 1993 amendments regarding subrogation, burial expense, and Second Injury Fund thresholds do not apply to injuries occurring before August 28, 1993. See Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Garffie, 939 S.W.2d 484 (Mo.App.1997); Stillwell v. Universal Const. Co., 922 S.W.2d 448 (Mo.App.1996).
Claimant’s argument also ignores what this court said in Smart v. Missouri State Treasurer, 916 S.W.2d 367 (Mo.App.1996): “The 1993 amendment [to § 287.220] is a hodgepodge of words that deal with both procedural and substantive issues.” Id. at 370. Contrary to Claimant’s argument, there is no rule of law to the effect that all workers’ compensation amendments are remedial in the sense that they must always be applied retroactively.
Claimant also argues that § 287.220.9 does not concern vested rights of the parties, but only prescribe the method in which the average weekly wage is to be determined. Consequently, Claimant contends this statute must be viewed as remedial and applied retroactively. To support this contention, Claimant cites Croffoot v. Max German, Inc., 857 S.W.2d 435 (Mo.App.1993) (holding that an interest statute, § 287.160.3, applied retroactively), Leutzinger v. Treasurer, 895 S.W.2d 591 (Mo.App.1995) (holding that 287.220.1 was remedial), and Vaughan v. Taft Broadcasting Co., 708 S.W.2d 656 (Mo.banc 1986) (holding that statute limiting punitive damages in service letter cases was remedial and applied retroactively). We note § 287.220.9 was not addressed by any of these cases, whereas Stark deals directly with this provision. We remain convinced that Stark was correctly decided and deny Claimant’s Point III.

Point I: Average Weekly Wage Determination Under § 287.250.1(5)

The Commission calculated the average weekly wage pursuant to § 287.250.1 and subparagraph (5) thereof. It reads:
“1. Except as otherwise provided for in this chapter, the method of computing an injured employee’s average weekly earnings which will serve as the basis for compensation provided for in this chapter shall be as follows:
[[Image here]]
(5) If the employee has been employed less than two calendar weeks immediately preceding the injury, the employee’s weekly wage shall be considered to be equivalent to the average weekly wage prevailing in the same or similar employment at the time of the injury, except if the employer has agreed to a certain hourly wage, then the hourly wage agreed upon multiplied by the number of weekly hours scheduled *417shall be the employee’s average weekly wage.” (emphasis supplied).
Claimant agrees that the Commission properly relied on § 287.250.1(5) in setting Employee’s average weekly wage, but insists that the Commission erred when it applied the exception (underlined above) rather than the general rule (italicized above). She argues that there was not sufficient competent evidence in the record to warrant the trial court’s finding that Clark agreed to pay Employee $4.50 per hour. Accordingly, Claimant insists we should remand with directions to the Commission so it can determine Employee’s average weekly wage from the evidence already in the record concerning the prevailing wage of same or similar employment.
The following is the Commission’s explanation of how it arrived at Employee’s average weekly wage.
“The deceased employee began work for Clark ... on July 22, 1993_ He worked nine days, 59 hours, and ... had worked less than two full calendar weeks ‘immediately preceding his death.... The claimant’s own exhibits indicate that the [Employee] and [Clark] had agreed on an hourly wage of $U.50. ($265.00 -*Ã¢ÂÂ  59 hours). ... Based on the days [Employee] actually performed work, his average work week was 29.5 hours. Multiplied by his hourly wage of $4.50, the deceased’s average weekly wage was $132.75.” (emphasis supplied).
The exhibits referred to by the Commission consisted of a calendar book record kept by Employee (Exhibit “A”) and the W-2 form issued by Clark reporting wages it paid to Employee (Exhibit “C”).
Claimant identified Exhibit “A” as a calendar book in which Employee wrote down information about his work. For example, it recorded mileage, sales figures, and vehicle maintenance information relating to his route sales job with M & M. Also, once Employee started working for Clark he recorded the “[t]ime he was supposed to work at Clark each day.” For example, Exhibit “A” contained the following entry on August 1, 1993: “Clark 2:00-10:30.” However, Employee put nothing in the calendar book about his wage amounts or wage rates with Clark. Moreover, Exhibit “A” appears to be a record of when Employee was scheduled to work, not necessarily when he worked. This is demonstrated by entries concerning Employee’s work schedule with Clark for the three-day period after Employee was killed. Thus, for August 6 there is written “Clark: 5:30-12:30[;]” for August 7, “Clark 3:00-12:30[;]” and on August 8, “2:00-10:30.”
As to Exhibit “C” (W-2 form), it reported Employee’s earnings with Clark as $265.50. Being in the usual form, this W-2 revealed nothing about Employee’s wage rate or terms of employment.
The Commission took Employee’s work schedule and W-2 information to mean that Clark had agreed to compensate Employee on an hourly basis. Because Employee was scheduled to work 59 hours, the Commission reasoned that it could divide the number of hours scheduled into the compensation paid to arrive at an hourly rate. Accordingly, the Commission utilized this “inference” to establish that Clark agreed to pay Employee $4.50 per hour. We cannot agree that this is an inference that the evidence supports with reasonable certainty.
“The Commission is the trier of fact and may draw reasonable inferences from the facts that it sees fit to draw. Snowbarger v. M.F.A., 349 S.W.2d 224, 225 (Mo.banc 1961). However, the Commission may not base its findings on conjecture. Lunn v. Columbian Steel Tank Co., 364 Mo. 1241, 275 S.W.2d 298, 301 (1955). The court, in Williams v. Cavender, 378 S.W.2d 537 (Mo.1964) stated:
‘For the inference to be legitimate the circumstances must of course point to the desired conclusion with reasonable certainty; and it is not enough that they may be merely consistent with such a conclusion, or that they may give equal support to inconsistent and contradictory conclusions.’ Id. at 541.”
McMillin v. Payless Cashways, 897 S.W.2d 661, 664[1,2] (Mo.App.1995).
The inference drawn by the Commission from Exhibits “A” and “C,” i.e., that Clark agreed to pay Employee an hourly wage of *418$4.50, is not legitimate. This follows because the circumstances do not point to the desired conclusion with reasonable certainty. See McMillin, 897 S.W.2d at 664. Nothing in the evidence demonstrates that Employee actually worked 59 hours. Clark tendered no time sheets or other records showing the actual hours worked by Employee. Exhibit “A” only contained a record of when Employee was scheduled to work, not when he actually worked. Moreover, Clark did not adduce any evidence about the agreed rate of pay.2
Although the circumstances revealed by Exhibits “A” and “C” might be consistent with the conclusion drawn by the Commission, that is not enough. Id. Exhibits “A” and “C” would equally support the conclusion that Clark agreed to pay Employee by the day, week, or month. We conclude there is no evidence to support the Commission’s decision that Clark had agreed to pay Employee $4.50 per hour. Without any evidence of an agreed hourly rate, § 287.250.1(5) mandates that Employee’s average weekly wage be computed based on the average weekly wage prevailing for convenience store employees as of August 5,1993.
At the evidentiary hearing before the ALJ, Claimant offered evidence from two witnesses concerning the average weekly wage prevailing for convenience store workers. Additionally, there was substantial evidence that the average weekly wage prevailing at the time would have been at least $189.38 based on Clark’s calculations.
Upon remand, the Commission shall determine Employee’s average weekly wage based upon the prevailing wage evidence in the record.
In light of our holding in regard to Point I, we need not address Point II. The portion of the Commission’s award setting Claimant’s death benefit at $88.49 per week is reversed and the cause remanded for determination of Claimant’s death benefit in accordance with this opinion. In all other respects, the Commission’s award is affirmed.
PARRISH, P.J., and BARNEY, J., concur.

. All statutory references are to RSMo 1994 unless otherwise indicated.


. The only evidence adduced by Clark was a document that apparently is a computation of Employee's average weekly wage at $189.38 under § 287.250.3. We say ""apparently” because the document, marked as Clark’s Exhibit “l,” was offered and received by the ALJ without any explanation or identification. The exhibit itself contains no explanation about the source or meaning of the calculations contained therein. We note, however, that Clark urged both the ALJ and Commission to compute Employee’s average weekly wage according to § 287.250.3. Moreover, before trial, Clark voluntarily paid Claimant’s death benefits based upon an average weekly wage of $189.38.

612876,612876,1130441,Miami Tribe of Oklahoma v. United States,"MIAMI TRIBE OF OKLAHOMA, Plaintiff-Appellee, v. UNITED STATES of America, Kenneth Salazar, Secretary, United States Department of the Interior, Larry Echohawk, Assistant Secretary of Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Defendants-Appellants","

  TYMKOVICH, Circuit Judge.
 

  This appeal requires us to consider whether the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) properly exercised its discretion to reject a gift of property by a member of the Miami Tribe of Oklahoma to the tribe.
 

  James Smith wanted to transfer to the tribe a portion of his property interest in the Maria Christiana Reserve No. 35, located southwest of Kansas City, where the tribe has plans to develop gaming facilities. Federal law and restrictions on Smith’s fee interest required the BIA to approve any transfer. Citing concerns regarding fractionation of the land interests in the Reserve as well as the long-range best interests of Reserve landowners, the BIA denied Smith’s application to transfer the land. Miami Tribe challenges that decision. We hold the BIA properly exercised its discretion in denying the application.
 

  This appeal also raises a novel jurisdictional question regarding our review of administrative decisions following a remand from district court. In this case, we conclude the government has not abandoned its right to challenge the district court’s remand order, even though the government substantially prevailed in the district court’s final judgment.
 

  For the reasons set forth below, we find the district court erred in its remand order reversing the BIA’s denial of Smith’s application. Therefore we VACATE the district court’s final judgment and its order reversing the BIA, and we REMAND for
   
   *916
   
  further consideration of Smith’s application consistent with this opinion.
 

  I. Background
 

  The Maria Christiana Reserve No. 35 (Reserve)
  
   1
  
  is a 35-acre parcel of land located in Miami County, Kansas. It is approximately 180 miles from Miami Tribe’s current land-base in Ottawa County, Oklahoma. Because it bears on the merits of this appeal, we review the relevant portions of the complicated history of Miami Tribe’s emigration to, and eventual departure from, the Reserve.
  
   2
  


  A.
  
   History of the Reserve
  


  The origins of the Reserve trace back to 1838. Through a treaty with Miami Tribe, the United States set aside land west of the Mississippi River with the implied understanding that the tribe, then located in Indiana, would emigrate there.
  
   See
  
  Treaty with the Miamies, 7 Stat. 569, 571 (Nov. 6, 1838). In 1840, the tribe ceded all its land in Indiana and agreed to move to land in Kansas, which the United States Senate had designated.
  
   See
  
  Treaty with the Mia-mies, 7 Stat. 582, 582-85 (Nov. 28, 1840).
 

  The tribe moved to the land in Kansas in 1846, but a large number of tribal members remained in Indiana and severed their relationship with the tribe.
  
   See Miami Tribe of Okla. v. United States,
  
  281 F.2d 202, 213 (Ct.C1.1960); 17 Op. Att’y Gen. 410, 411-12 (1882). The Miami Tribe was split into two groups: (1) the Western Miamis, who emigrated to Kansas and were considered part of Miami Tribe, and (2) the Indiana Miamis, who remained in Indiana and were no longer members of the tribe.
  
   See
  
  12 Op. Att’y Gen. 236, 239 (1867).
 

  In 1854, the Western Miamis ceded all but 70,640 acres of their land in Kansas to the United States in return for payments to the tribe and other investments.
  
   See
  
  Treaty with the Miami Indians, 10 Stat. 1093,1093 (June 5,1854). The 1854 treaty acknowledged the division of Miami Tribe into two groups—Western Miamis and Indiana Miamis—after its move to Kansas and excluded the Indiana Miamis from receiving payment for the ceded Kansas lands.
  
   Id.
  
  at 1094-95. The 1854 treaty, however, did divide up payments still owed to the Western and Indiana Miamis from the 1840 treaty.
  
   Id.
  
  at 1095. Only Indiana Miamis who were on an agreed-upon list, which could be modified only with the consent of the Indiana Miamis, would receive payment.
  
   Id.
  
  at 1099.
 

  In 1858, several families, including that of Maria Christiana DeRome, petitioned Congress to be included on the list of Indiana Miamis who would receive payments under the 1840 treaty. The DeR-ome family were excluded from the 1854 list because they were not considered of Miami blood.
  
   Miami Tribe of Okla. v. United States,
  
  927 F.Supp. 1419, 1424 (D.Kan.1996) (citing H.R. Exec. Doc. No. 23, 49th Cong., 1st Sess. 1, 6 (1886)). In a unilateral decision, Congress added the petitioners to the list.
  
   3
  
  See Act of June 12, 1858, 11 Stat. 329, 332. Congress also
   
   *917
   
  directed that each individual receive a portion of the unpaid annuity payments and be allotted 200 acres of land from the 70,640 retained by the tribe in Kansas.
  
   Id.
  
  That is, these individuals were given land retained by the Western Miamis even though the individuals were not Western Miamis, or even considered of Miami blood. In 1859, the Reserve was patented as a restricted Indian allotment of 200 acres.
  
   4
  
  It was from this allotment that the Maria Christiana Reserve No. 35 was created.
 

  Several years later the Miami Tribe, now consisting only of the Western Miamis, entered into a treaty encouraging it to move from Kansas to Oklahoma.
  
   See
  
  Treaty with the PeorÃÂ­as, Kaskaskias, et. al, 15 Stat. 513, 520 (Feb. 23, 1867). Congress agreed to purchase the Western Miami’s unallotted lands in Kansas if the tribe signified its interest in selling, which it did.
  
   See
  
  Act of Mar. 3, 1873, 17 Stat. 631, 631. Those who remained in Kansas could, meeting certain requirements, become United States citizens, but would end their membership in the tribe.
  
   Id.
  
  at 632. Those members who moved to Oklahoma retained their tribal membership.
  
   Id.
  


  Through that same 1873 legislation, Congress directed the Secretary of the Interior to take a census of the Western Miamis and determine who was entitled to the lands and monies set aside for the Western Miamis from the sale of their land in Kansas through the 1854 treaty.
  
   Id.
  
  In compiling this census, the individuals added by Congress in 1858 to the list of Miami Indians were not included.
  
   Id.
  
  at 632-33. These Miami Indians were not considered members of the Western Miamis and only Western Miamis were entitled to payment under the 1854 treaty.
  
   See
  
  17 Op. Att’y Gen. 410, 414-15 (July 7, 1882). Those not on the census were not entitled to share in the proceeds from the lands sold under the 1873 legislation or from the annuities in the 1854 treaty.
  
   Id.
  
  Again, the legislation reinforced that individuals, such as Maria Christiana DeRome, were not part of the Western Miamis, who had settled in Kansas and eventually moved to Oklahoma.
 

  In 1891, after a petition to Congress and an action before the Court of Claims, the United States reimbursed the Western Miamis for the money erroneously paid as back annuities to the individuals erroneously added in 1858 as well as for the value of the land allotted to them.
  
   See Miami Tribe of Okla.,
  
  281 F.2d at 212. Fast forwarding to 1960, the Western Miamis again brought suit in the Court of Claims, seeking interest on the payments made in 1891. The court awarded interest from the time of the erroneous payments (1858) and allotments (1859) until 1891.
  
   Id.
  


  For this appeal, the most important fact is that Maria Christiana DeRome was not a member of the Western Miamis and
   
   *918
   
  should not have received the allotment of land that became the Reserve. In fact, Miami Tribe was reimbursed by the United States for the land improperly allotted to non-members-ineluding the Reserve allotted to Maria Christiana DeRome.
 

  B.
  
   Smith’s Gift Transfer
  


  Smith holds a 3/88 undivided restricted fee interest in the 35-acre Reserve.
  
   5
  
  While the Department of the Interior has found it “not entirely clear” how interests in the Reserve descended to the many heirs of Maria Christiana DeRome, it is undisputed that Smith inherited his interest as an heir of DeRome and shares his interest with over 20 other landowners.
  
   6
  
  ApltApp. at 149-50;
  
   see also id.
  
  at 171-78 (June 2009 BIA Title Status Report listing current interest-holders in the Reserve).
 

  Smith is also a member of Miami Tribe. In 1996, to strengthen its connection with the Reserve, the tribe amended its constitution and adopted all current Reserve landowners, enlisting them as tribal members. Then, in 2001, Smith decided to give a portion of his interest to the tribe, ostensibly as a benefit to the tribe and its members. Because the land was held in restricted fee, as we describe in greater detail below, federal law required the BIA to approve the transfer. Smith applied to the BIA for approval to convey by gift 1/3 of his 3/38 undivided interest (i.e. 1/38 interest) in the Reserve to Miami Tribe.
 

  The BIA denied Smith’s application for two reasons. It found the transfer (1) was not in the long-range best interests of Smith or other Reserve landowners, and (2) conflicted with the federal government’s policy of avoiding further fractionation of interests in Indian lands. Smith appealed to the Interior Board of Indian Appeals (IBIA) of the United States Department of the Interior, which affirmed the BIA’s decision.
 

  C.
  
   Federal Court Proceedings
  


  Miami Tribe brought suit in federal district court challenging the BIA’s denial of Smith’s application on various statutory and constitutional grounds.
  
   7
  
  The primary challenge was under the Administrative Procedures Act (APA), which was bifurcated from the other claims so it could be addressed first.
 

  Following bifurcation, the district court issued an order (2005 Order) with respect to the APA claim and reversed the BIA’s decision. The district court found the BIA’s decision was arbitrary and capricious, and contrary to law, because (1) Smith, as a tribal member, possessed a special relationship with Miami Tribe, (2) the BIA failed to consider the long-range best interests of the tribe, and (3) Miami Tribe exercised jurisdiction over the Reserve, which brought the gift within the federal government’s policy encouraging
   
   *919
   
  such transfers. The court remanded the matter to the BIA with instructions to approve Smith’s application, while acknowledging other claims still remained pending before the district court.
 

  The BIA objected and filed a motion requesting the district court reconsider its decision and affirm the BIA’s decision. In the alternative, the government requested the court remand the matter to the BIA for its consideration, rather than outright reversing the BIA with instructions to approve Smith’s application.
 

  The district court granted in part and denied in part the government’s motion and modified its 2005 Order. Rather than mandate the BIA approve Smith’s application on remand, the court remanded the case to the BIA for further proceedings “consistent” with the 2005 Order. Specifically, the court remanded the case for the BIA to consider the long-term impact of Smith’s proposed transfer on the further fractionation of the Reserve.
 

  Given the procedural posture it faced, the BIA filed a notice of appeal seeking our review of the 2005 Order and the order on reconsideration. Before any briefing, however, the BIA shifted gears and moved to voluntarily dismiss the appeal. It conceded
 

  [T]hat significant questions could be raised with respect to the appealability of the [2005 Order] in its present form. We want to ensure that any appeal is focused on the merits of this action rather than on issues of appellate jurisdiction .... Accordingly, federal defendants intend to seek a Rule 54(b) judgment in district court and, if granted, file a new notice of appeal.
 

  Amended Motion to Voluntarily Dismiss Appeal at 1,
  
   Miami Tribe of Okla. v. United States,
  
  No. 06-3037 (10th Cir. Apr. 24, 2006).
 

  After dismissal of the appeal, the district court stayed the remaining two counts pending the BIA’s disposition on remand. The court determined resolution of the issue on remand would simplify the remaining issues before the court and promote judicial economy. At this point, the BIA requested a Rule 54(b) judgment as to the 2005 Order from which the government could take an immediate appeal. The BIA argued the district court had already decided to stay the remaining counts and resolve the APA count to simplify the issues and promote judicial economy. Any potential harm from piecemeal litigation, it contended, would be outweighed by resolving the APA claim on the merits first. The tribe opposed the motion, asserting the 2005 Order was not a final decision and the government’s request was untimely.
 

  The district court denied the government’s request for several reasons. The court, first, found the 2005 Order was not an ultimate disposition of a claim and the remand order “fully contemplates further proceedings once the BIA issues its decision upon remand.” Aplt.App. at 78. Second, the 2005 Order was not distinct and separable from the two unresolved claims, and the BIA’s decision on remand would likely affect future determination of those claims. Third, denying the motion follows the general rule that administrative-remand orders are ordinarily not appealable because they are non-final decisions. The district court found the exceptions to this rule did not apply because the government failed to show either that the 2005 Order resolved a serious and unsettled question or that it was foreclosed from future appellate review of the issues, finally, the government’s motion was filed ten months after the 2005 Order was issued and the court found this excessive delay justified its denial. The BIA did not seek to appeal this order.
 

 
   *920
   
  On remand, the BIA approved Smith’s application but denied his request to convey the land in trust status because Smith held the land in restricted fee, not trust.
  
   8
  
  The BIA stated the tribe needed to submit a fee-to-trust application, which it had not, before the BIA would accept the land in trust status for the tribe.
  
   See generally
  
  25 C.F.R. part 151. The IBIA affirmed the BIA’s decision.
 

  Miami Tribe returned to federal court to challenge this decision. The tribe filed a two-count amended complaint alleging the BIA’s refusal to transfer Smith’s interest in trust (1) violated the Indian Land Consolidation Act (ILCA), and (2) was a breach of trust. The district court affirmed the BIA’s order and dismissed the tribe’s breach of trust claim.
  
   See Miami Tribe of Okla. v. United States,
  
  679 F.Supp.2d 1269 (D.Kan.2010).
 

  With the entry of a final judgment, the government filed a notice of appeal seeking review of the district court’s 2005 Order reversing the BIA’s initial denial of Smith’s application.
 

  II. Discussion
 

  The BIA urges us to reverse the 2005 Order because the BIA’s decision to deny Smith’s application was properly within its discretion. It also argues the tribe lacks jurisdiction over the Reserve, and further, that denying Smith’s transfer does not conflict with federal government policy promoting consolidation of tribal lands.
 

  The tribe in turn argues we lack jurisdiction because the BIA cannot appeal the district court’s decision affirming the BIA’s own determination. It also contends the 2005 Order was correct because the tribe has jurisdiction over the Reserve and the BIA’s fractionation concerns were unfounded.
 

  First we consider our appellate jurisdiction before turning to the merits.
 

  A.
  
   Appellate Jurisdiction
  


  Miami Tribe claims we lack jurisdiction because the government’s appeal of the district court’s final judgment affirming the BIA’s decision presents no case or controversy.
 

  The government responds that we have jurisdiction for several reasons. First, the government appeals from the first and only
  
   final
  
  judgment of the district court. Throughout the remand and subsequent district court proceedings, the government was clear it intended to appeal the 2005 Order. In its view, the final judgment of the district court on appeal here, even though it affirms the BIA’s decision on remand, is a direct and natural consequence of the unfavorable 2005 Order that controlled the BIA’s decision on remand.
 

  Second and relatedly, the government argues it could not appeal the 2005 Order any earlier. It notes administrative-remand orders—such as the 2005 Order— are generally not immediately appealable because they are non-final judgments. The government acknowledges the limited exception to this rule, which permits an immediate appeal when an agency is likely foreclosed from seeking future appellate review, but argues the exception does not apply here.
 

  From this procedural posture, two jurisdictional questions present themselves. The first is whether the government—even after the BIA approved Smith’s application on remand—has standing to challenge the 2005 Order. The government prevailed in the district court after remand because the court affirmed the BIA’s approval of
   
   *921
   
  Smith’s application. But the government claims the 2005 Order circumscribed its discretion, which made the outcome on remand inevitable, and therefore has standing to challenge the order now. So we must consider whether the government can appeal in these circumstances.
 

  The second question is whether the government should have taken an immediate, interlocutory appeal of the 2005 Order, and whether the government’s decision not to pursue an earlier appeal precludes its present challenge to the order.
 

  We address each question in turn.
 

  1.
  
   BIA Appeal’of the 2005 Order
  


  We first consider whether the BIA has standing to challenge the 2005 Order through an appeal from the district court’s final judgment.
 

  It is bedrock law that we have jurisdiction over all final decisions of federal district courts under 28 U.S.C. § 1291. This jurisdiction is generally contingent upon “the existence of a decision by the District Court that ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.”
  
   Coopers & Lybrand v. Livesay,
  
  437 U.S. 463, 467, 98 S.Ct. 2454, 57 L.Ed.2d 351 (1978) (quotations omitted). With a final judgment from a district court, “a notice of appeal which names the final judgment is sufficient to support review of all earlier orders that merge in the final judgment.”
  
   McBride v. CITGO Petroleum Corp.,
  
  281 F.3d 1099, 1104 (10th Cir.2002). “[I]t is a general rule that all earlier interlocutory orders merge into final orders and judgments except when the final order is a dismissal for failure to prosecute.”
  
   Id.
  
  (citing 16A Wright & Miller, Federal Practice & Procedure § 3949.4 (3d ed. 1999 & Supp.2001)). Through an appeal of a final judgment, a party can obtain appellate review of both the final judgment and any interlocutory orders.
 

  Generally, “only a party aggrieved by a judgment or order of a district court may exercise the statutory right to appeal,” and thus a “party who receives all that he has sought generally is not aggrieved by the judgment affording the relief and cannot appeal from it.”

But in certain eases, an “appeal may be permitted from an adverse ruling collateral to the judgment on the merits at the behest of the party who has prevailed on the merits, so long as that party retains a stake in the appeal satisfying the requirements of Art. III.”

Thus, if a party prevails in the final judgment of a district court, but has sustained an adverse ruling in a district court’s prior interlocutory order, the party may still have standing to appeal under Article III.

There, government officials were permitted to challenge a lower court’s ruling that their conduct violated the Constitution, even though the Court also determined the officials were protected from liability by qualified immunity.

  The BIA meets these requirements in this appeal.
 

  A central inquiry in assessing the BIA’s continuing interest in an appeal challenging the 2005 Order is whether the order limited the BIA’s discretion on remand.
 

  “When an administrative agency has made an error of law, the duty of the Court is to correct the error of law committed by that body, and, after doing so to remand the case to the [agency] so as to afford it the opportunity of examining the evidence and finding the facts as required by law.”
  
   NLRB v. Enter. Ass’n of Pipefitters Local 638,
  
  429 U.S. 507, 522, 97 S.Ct. 891, 51 L.Ed.2d 1 (1977) (quotation omitted). Under the law of the case doctrine, on remand, an agency must abide by a district court’s remand order.
  
   See Poppa v. Astrue,
  
  569 F.3d 1167, 1170 (10th Cir. 2009). We have stated that
 

  [Ajlthough primarily applicable between courts of different levels, the doctrine [of law of the case] and the mandate rule apply to judicial review of administrative decisions, and require the administrative agency, on remand from a court, to conform its further proceedings in the case to the principles set forth in the judicial decision, unless there is a compelling reason to depart.
 


   Copart, Inc. v. Admin. Review Bd., U.S. Dep’t of Labor,
  
  495 F.3d 1197, 1201 (10th Cir.2007) (quotation omitted);
  
   see also
  
  3 Admin. L. & Prac, § 8:31 (3d ed.) (“The ‘law of the case’ doctrine applies on remand and the agency is bound by findings and conclusions from the reviewing court if properly within judicial authority.”). An agency may depart from the law of the case on remand under only a few narrow exceptions, none of which apply here.
  
   See Grigsby v. Barnhart,
  
  294 F.3d 1215, 1219 n. 4 (10th Cir.2002) (“There are three ‘exceptionally narrow1 reasons to depart from the law of the case: (1) when the evidence in a subsequent trial is substantially different; (2) when controlling authority has subsequently made a contrary decision of the law applicable to such issues; or (3) when the decision was clearly erroneous and would work a manifest injustice.” (quotation omitted)).
 

  Here, the law of the case doctrine required the BIA to conform its proceedings on remand to the 2005 Order. While the BIA failed to reference the 2005 Order in its decision on remand, neither party disputes the BIA had to comply with the legal standards it set forth. In doing so, the BIA in particular had to follow the order’s directive to consider certain factors on remand. And although the district court amended its initial order—removing its mandate to approve Smith’s application
  
   10
  
  —it made clear the court understood the law required BIA approval of Smith’s application. In this way, the BIA’s discretion on remand was channeled through the limitations of the 2005 Order.
 

 
   *923
   
  This case is not a situation where an agency exercised uncircumscribed discretion on remand and simply changed its mind. In such a case, the new decision would be solely due to the agency’s discretionary action, not a court order. In contrast, here the BIA operated under the district court’s interpretation of the law governing the BIA’s approval process as set forth in the 2005 Order. While the BIA has discretion to approve land transfers—and arguably retained discretion on pain of contempt to deny the gift on remand
  
   11
  
  —it was bound by the district court’s ruling that Miami Tribe had jurisdiction (which we discuss below) over the Reserve for the purposes of the ILCA. This finding required the BIA to further a statutory preference expressed in 25 U.S.C. § 2216(a)—encouraging the consolidation of lands between Indians and tribes “that exereise[ ] jurisdiction over the land.” That policy preference directly affected the BIA’s calculus on remand.
 

  The 2005 Order constrained the BIA’s discretion on remand. Given these circumstances, the BIA retains a personal stake in the adverse, interlocutory 2005 Order to confer standing to appeal, even though the government nominally prevailed in the district court’s final judgment.
 

  2.
  
   Interlocutory Appeal
  


  The government initially sought an interlocutory appeal of the 2005 Order, and at first, this may appear to be the more prudent solution to the BIA’s dilemma. But, under § 1291, a “remand by a district court to an administrative agency for further proceedings is ordinarily not appeal-able because it is not a final decision.”
  
   Bender v. Clark,
  
  744 F.2d 1424, 1426-27 (10th Cir.1984).
  
   12
  
  Nonetheless, this “administrative-remand rule” is not without exception, and in certain circumstances an immediate appeal is possible.
  
   Baca-Prieto v. Guigni
  
  95 F.3d 1006, 1008 (10th Cir.1996).
 

  We have recognized a “practical finality rule” that operates as an important caveat to the general limitation on appeals from an administrative-remand order.

   Graham v. Hartford Life & Accident Ins. Co.,
  
  501 F.3d 1153, 1157 (10th Cir.2007);
  
   see also Baca-Prieto,
  
  95 F.3d at 1009 (noting the
  
   Bender
  
  line of cases is a “prudential limitation on the administrative-remand rule”). “The practical finality rule may be invoked when the lack of immediate review of an order for an administrative remand would violate basic judicial principles,”
  
   Graham,
  
  501 F.3d at 1157 (quotation omit
   
   *924
   
  ted), namely issues that are both “urgent and important.”
  
   Trout Unlimited v. U.S. Dep’t. of Agric.,
  
  441 F.3d 1214, 1218 (10th Cir.2006). “If these two conditions are met, this court will apply a balancing test and assert jurisdiction if ‘the danger of injustice by delaying appellate review outweighs the inconvenience and costs of piecemeal review.’ ”
  
   Id.
  
  (quoting
  
   Bender,
  
  744 F.2d at 1427).
 

  In practice, we have applied the practical finality rule “when it is necessary to ensure that we can review important legal questions which a remand may make effectively unreviewable, because administrative agencies may be barred from seeking district court (and thus circuit court) review of their own administrative decisions.”
  
   Graham,
  
  501 F.3d at 1158 (quotation omitted);
  
   see also Baca-Prieto,
  
  95 F.3d at 1010 (finding the remand order decided an important issue regarding INS exclusion jurisdiction and directed the decision on remand from which the INS would have no appeal);
  
   Cotton Petroleum v. U.S. Dep’t of Interior,
  
  870 F.2d 1515, 1521-22 (10th Cir.1989) (noting the district court remand order resolved “threshold legal issues” and we based our decision both on the importance of the issue and the fact “delay in review ... would likely result in further disputes and litigation, confusion and danger of injustice”). In cases where we determined we lacked jurisdiction, we found the issues insignificant or subject to future appellate review.
  
   See Trout Unlimited,
  
  441 F.3d at 1219 (finding no reason compelling “urgent or immediate judicial consideration” because “delayed review will not [cause] injustice,” and will not cause additional disputes and litigation).
  
   14
  


  When we have heard interlocutory appeals under the practical finality rule, central to our analysis was a concern the agency likely would be foreclosed from future appellate review. That was not the case here. At the time of the 2005 Order, two counts of Miami Tribe’s complaint remained pending before the district court and had been stayed for further proceedings before the agency.
  
   15
  
  Future appellate review likely was
  
   not
  
  foreclosed and the government’s immediate appeal likely would not have fallen within the practical finality exception.
 

  As a general matter, if additional proceedings in a district court are contemplated after remand to an agency—as here— we think the better rule is for the government to wait until a final judgment is entered. This comports with the final judgment rule’s preference for a single
   
   *925
   
  appeal, even if the agency prevails on some of the claims on remand. The rule, moreover, avoids the perverse incentive encouraging an agency to seek an immediate appeal of a remand order (even if it was unlikely the case fell within the practical finality exception) if the agency had a whiff that we would take jurisdiction over the interlocutory appeal.
 

  We have located one case,
  
   Viraj Group, Ltd. v. United States,
  
  343 F.3d 1371 (Fed.Cir.2003), with a similar procedural posture to that presented here. It also examined whether the government had standing to appeal when it prevailed in the lower court’s final judgment, but had previously sustained adverse interlocutory orders remanding to the agency. The court observed the
 

  [Ajppeal comes to us in a strange posture: The government has appealed from the court’s decision
  
   affirming
  
  the government agency’s determination; in other words, the winner has appealed because its determination was affirmed by the trial court only on the basis of reasoning with which it disagrees.
 


   Id.
  
  at 1375. The government asserted it had standing to appeal—even though it was the prevailing party—because it could not appeal from the earlier remand decisions based on the general rule that administrative-remand decisions are not final judgments. Like here,
  
   Viraj
  
  raised the question of “whether the government ... should have appealed from one of the [lower courtfs earlier decisions, and whether its failure to do so deprives it of standing in this appeal.”
  
   Id.
  
  at 1376. Addressing the government’s situation, the court noted
 

  The fact that the government perhaps could have appealed from one of the court’s earlier decisions creates a circular dilemma. To hold that the government could have appealed sooner, we must necessarily find that it cannot bring this appeal; and to hold that it cannot bring this appeal, we must find that it could have appealed sooner.
 


   Id.
  
  The court went on to conclude that
 

  Rather than bootstrap our reasoning to reach those two conclusions we believe that the better course is to hold that the government has sufficient standing to bring this appeal. Even though technically the prevailing party under the [lower courtj’s final decision, the government prevailed only because it acquiesced and abandoned its original position, which it had zealously advocated, and adopted under protest a contrary position forced upon it by the court. Thus, in substance, the government is truly the non-prevailing party in this case. To hold otherwise would exalt form over substance. We therefore are satisfied that this appeal presents a ease or controversy that we can address on the merits.
 


   Id.
  


  We find this reasoning persuasive and applicable. Given the procedural posture of this case, and the district court’s inherent limitations on remand, the government is “truly the non-prevailing party” on the core issue of its statutory discretion and Miami Tribe’s jurisdiction over the Reserve. We conclude we have jurisdiction to hear the government’s challenge to the 2005 Order through its appeal from the district court’s final judgment.
 

  B.
  
   Merits
  


  Having assured ourselves we have jurisdiction to hear the government’s appeal, we turn to the merits of the BIA’s challenge to the 2005 Order.
 

  Smith owned a 3/38 undivided restricted interest in the Reserve and applied to give 1/3 of his interest (i.e. 1/38 interest) to Miami Tribe. He wanted to make the gift because of his “desire to do something for the benefit of the Miami Tribe and its
   
   *926
   
  members.” ApltApp. at 132. The RIA denied Smith’s application because (1) the gift transfer was not in Smith’s or other Reserve landowners’ long-range best interests, and (2) the transfer would conflict with the government’s policy regarding fractionated interests in Indian land. In its 2005 Order, the district court reversed the BIA’s decision, finding it arbitrary and capricious, and contrary to law. We disagree with this conclusion, finding the BIA properly applied the applicable statutes and regulations when it denied Smith’s application.
 

  We review the district court’s 2005 Order reversing the BIA de novo, and we will set aside agency action “only if we conclude that it was ‘arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.’”

  615 F.3d 1244, 1253 (10th Cir.2010) (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)). Agency action is arbitrary and capricious if it “entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem, offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency, or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.”

  When reviewing an agency’s interpretation of a statute, “[i]f Congress has spoken directly to the issue, that is the end of the matter; the court, as well as the agency, must give effect to Congress’s unambiguously expressed intent.”

  519 U.S. 452, 461, 117 S.Ct. 905, 137 L.Ed.2d 79, (1997)).
 

  At the outset, we also note the overarching regulatory framework governing a gift of Indian land. In the Indian Land Consolidation Act (ILCA), the United States stated its policy of encouraging the consolidation of Indian land ownership and preventing further fractionation of Indian lands.
  
   See
  
  25 U.S.C. §§ 2201 note, 2216(a). Under the ILCA, the Secretary of the Department of the Interior “is authorized in his discretion, and upon application of the Indian owners ... to approve conveyances, with respect to lands or interests in lands held by individual Indians.”
  
   Id.
  
  § 483. An Indian may give an
   
   *927
   
  interest in land to a tribe “for an amount less than the fair market value of that interest.”
  
   Id.
  
  § 2216(b). Such a gift is a two-part transaction consisting of the disposal and acquisition of the land.
  
   See
  
  25 C.F.R. parts 161 (acquisitions) & 152 (disposal). Our focus in this case is the disposal of Indian land, specifically Smith’s gift of a restricted interest in the Reserve to Miami Tribe. The BIA has promulgated regulations—applicable here, 25 C.F.R. §§ 152.23 and 152.25(d)—addressing the sale, exchange, and conveyance of Indian trust or restricted lands.
 

  Before addressing the BIA’s decision applying these regulations, we must consider whether the tribe has jurisdiction over the Reserve and the ILCA encourages approval of Smith’s application.
 

  1.
  
   Miami Tribe’s Jurisdiction Over the Reserve
  


  The tribe’s jurisdiction over the Reserve is a key threshold issue. The ILCA policy encouraging land consolidation between Indians and Indian tribes applies
  
   only
  
  to land the tribe has jurisdiction over.
  
   See
  
  25 U.S.C. § 2216(a)(2) (encouraging consolidation of land ownership “between Indians and the tribal government
  
   that exercises jurisdiction over the land
  
  ”) (emphasis added). If the Miami Tribe exercises jurisdiction over the Reserve, the ILCA’s policy would apply and substantially change the calculus of the BIA’s decision.
 

  The tribe argues it has jurisdiction over the Reserve and the congressional directive to facilitate consolidation applies to Smith’s gift to the tribe. The BIA did not apply this policy preference at first because it contends the tribe does not exercise jurisdiction over the Reserve. But, in the 2005 Order, the district court concluded the tribe had jurisdiction and therefore the policy preference in § 2216(a) served as the backdrop to the BIA’s decision on remand.
 

  In our review of the BIA’s decision, we consider the tribe’s jurisdiction over the Reserve, first, to determine whether the BIA should have started with this policy preference or simply a clean slate with nothing tilting the decision either way. After a careful review of the history, applicable law, and our previous cases reviewing the tribe’s connection to the Reserve, we can safely conclude the tribe does not have jurisdiction over the Reserve and therefore does not exercise jurisdiction for the purposes of § 2216(a).
 

  Congress passed the ILCA to address the problem of increasingly fractionated interests of Indian lands as well as to govern land conveyances between Indians and their tribes. In the ILCA, Congress stated
 

  It is the
  
   policy of the United States to encourage and assist the consolidation of land ownership through transac
  
  tions—
 

  (1) involving individual Indians;
 

  (2) between Indians and the tribal government that
  
   exercises jurisdiction over the land;
  
  or
 

  (3) between individuals who own an interest in trust and restricted land who wish to convey that interest to an Indian or the tribal government that exercises jurisdiction over the parcel of land involved
 

  25 U.S.C. § 2216(a) (emphasis added). To remedy the fractionation problem, the federal government favors consolidation of lands between Indians and tribes, but only regarding land where a tribe exercises jurisdiction.
 

  The ILCA does not define when a tribe “exercises jurisdiction over the land.” The district court found the tribe exercised jurisdiction over the Reserve for the pur
   
   *928
   
  poses of the ILCA and therefore the policy encouraging land consolidation applied to Smith’s gift. But the BIA argues we previously resolved the issue in
  
   Kansas v. United States,
  
  249 F.3d 1218 (10th Cir.2001)
  
   (Miami IV),
  
  finding the tribe lacked jurisdiction over the Reserve.
 

  In
  
   Miami IV,
  
  Kansas sought injunctive relief from a National Indian Gaming Commission (NIGC) determination that the Reserve’s 35-acre parcel constituted “Indian lands” under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA). 249 F.3d 1213, 1220 (10th Cir.2001);
  
   see
  
  25 U.S.C. § 2703(4) (defining “Indian lands” as all lands within an Indian reservation or restricted fee land held by a tribe or Indian “over which an Indian tribe exercises governmental power”). The district court concluded the NIGC’s decision ignored the threshold question of whether the tribe exercised jurisdiction over the Reserve and granted a preliminary injunction against all gaming related activities on the Reserve.
 

  On appeal, we determined the NIGC “put the cart before the horse” when it decided Miami Tribe exercised “governmental power” over the Reserve without, first, determining whether the tribe had jurisdiction over the Reserve.
  
   Miami IV,
  
  249 F.3d at 1229. We reasoned “before a sovereign may exercise governmental power over land, the sovereign, in its sovereign capacity, must have jurisdiction over that land.”
  
   Id.
  
  Any analysis of “Indian lands” under the IGRA must begin with the “threshold question of the Tribe’s jurisdiction, ... [which] focuses principally on congressional intent and purpose, rather than recent unilateral actions of the Miami Tribe.”
  
   Id.
  
  The tribe could not exercise governmental power over the Reserve without first having jurisdiction over the Reserve.
 

  Considering the jurisdiction issue, we found the “most probative evidence of congressional intent and purpose ... is the language of the legislation and treaties” regarding Miami Tribe and the Reserve.
  
   Id.
  
  The district court in
  
   Miami IV
  
  had already “thoroughly analyzed the question” of the tribe’s jurisdiction over the Reserve and “concluded that no lawful basis existed to suggest the Tribe presently had jurisdiction over the tract.”
  
   Id.
  
  at 1230 (citing
  
   Miami Tribe of Okla. v. United States, 927
  
  F.Supp. 1419, 1424-27 (D.Kan.1996)
  
   (Miami
  
  I)). We agreed, finding “Congress years ago
  
   ‘unambiguously
  
  intended to abrogate the Tribe’s authority of its lands in Kansas and move the Tribe to new lands in Oklahoma.’”
  
   Id.
  
  (quoting
  
   Miami I,
  
  927 F.Supp. at 1426). Among other events, in 1873, the tribe agreed to sell its land in Kansas and Congress expressly abrogated the tribe’s jurisdiction over those Kansas lands.
 

  The tribe did not appeal the district court’s findings regarding jurisdiction over the Reserve, and in
  
   Miami IV
  
  we found those conclusions to be res judieata. Rather than challenge the district court’s conclusions, Miami Tribe also asserted its recent activities on the Reserve supported its claim for jurisdiction. We rejected this argument, finding that the tribe’s recent connections to the Reserve (by adopting landowners as tribal members) did nothing to alter the fact that Congress had abrogated the tribe’s jurisdiction over the Reserve long ago.
 

  The same analysis is true here. Congress abrogated Miami Tribe’s jurisdiction over the Reserve over a century ago. Nothing changes the fact that “in 1873, Congress expressly abrogated the Tribe’s jurisdiction [over its former lands in Kansas], which was effective no later than 1924 when any members of the Tribe remaining in Kansas—and their heirs—became naturalized citizens.”
  
   Miami IV,
  
  249 F.3d at 1230 (quoting
  
   Kansas ex rel. Graves v.
  
 
   *929
   

   United States,
  
  86 F.Supp.2d 1094, 1096 (D.Kan.2000)
  
   (Miami
  
  III)). In addition to this clear abrogation by Congress, the Reserve was originally allotted to Maria Christiana DeRome, who was not a member of the Western Miarais. In fact, Miami Tribe was reimbursed by the United States for the value of the Reserve precisely because the land was erroneously taken from the tribe and allotted to a nonmember.
 

  To be sure, the tribe is actively connected to the Reserve. For example, it has among other things (1) adopted the Reserve landowners as members of the tribe, (2) received consent from the Reserve landowners to assert tribal jurisdiction pursuant to a lease, and (3) developed the Reserve, including regularly maintaining it and providing security. The tribe contends these actions demonstrate it exercises jurisdiction over the Reserve.
 

  But these are the same activities we rejected as a basis for the tribe’s claim of jurisdiction over the Reserve in
  
   Miami IV. Compare Miami IV,
  
  249 F.3d at 1230-31
  
   'with
  
  374 F.Supp.2d at 945. In
  
   Miami IV,
  
  we examined the tribe’s recent activity within the Reserve, including the adoption of landowners as members, but stated
 

  None of these recent events, however, alters the conclusion that Congress abrogated the Tribe’s jurisdiction over the tract long ago, and has done nothing since to change the status of the tract. An Indian tribe’s jurisdiction derives from the will of Congress, not from the consent of fee owners pursuant to a lease under which the lessee acts.
 


   Miami TV,
  
  249 F.3d at 1236-31. Similarly, here, Miami Tribe cannot “exercise jurisdiction” under § 2216(a) without a Congressional grant of jurisdiction over the Reserve.
  
   16
  


  In sum, the tribe lacks jurisdiction over the Reserve as required by the ILCA. Accordingly, the statutory policy in § 2216(a) encouraging consolidation does not apply to Smith’s gift. Without that preference weighing in the tribe’s favor, the decision to approve Smith’s gift rests squarely within the BIA’s discretion.
  
   17
  


  2.
  
   The BIA’s Decision
  


  Having settled the issue of the tribe’s jurisdiction, we now consider the BIA’s two reasons for deciding, in its discretion, to deny Smith’s application: (1) the gift was not in Smith’s or other Reserve landowners’ long-range best interests, and (2) the transfer would conflict with the federal government’s fractionation policy.
 


   Long-Range Best Interests
  


  The BIA denied Smith’s application, first, because it determined the gift was not in the long-range best interests of Smith or other Reserve landowners. When the BIA considers an application for a gift of restricted Indian land, the application “may be approved if, after careful examination of the circumstances in each case, the transaction appears to be
  
   dearly justified in the light of the long-range best interest of the owner
  
  or owners or as
   
   *930
   
  under conditions set out in § 152.25(d).” 25 C.F.R. § 152.23 (emphasis added). Section 152.25(d) governs “Gifts and conveyances for no consideration or less than the appraised fair market value,” and states
 


   With the approval of the Secretary, Indian owners may convey trust or restricted land, for less than the appraised fair market value or for no consideration
  
  when the prospective grantee is the owner’s spouse, brother, sister, lineal ancestor of Indian blood or lineal descendant, or
  
   when some other special relationship exists between the grantor and grantee
  
  or special circumstances exist that in the opinion of the Secretary warrant the approval of the conveyance.
 


   Id.
  
  § 152.25(d) (emphasis added). Distilling these regulations, an Indian may give an interest in restricted land if they have a special relationship with the grantee, and the BIA may approve such a gift if it concludes the gift is in the long-range best interests of the landowners.
 

  In applying these regulations, the BIA has a duty to consider the donor’s best interest
 

  In the case of a gift conveyance, it is BIA’s duty to ensure that the prospective donor understands and intends the effect of his/her action. It is also BIA’s duty to make a careful examination of the circumstances to determine whether the transaction is in the donor’s best interest. BIA must refrain from approving a gift deed where there is any question as to the donor’s intent or where the facts show the conveyance is not in the donor’s best interest.
 


   Downs v. Acting Muskogee Area Dir.,
  
  29 IBIA 94, 97 (1996) (citation omitted). When deciding whether to approve a gift conveyance the “BIA owes a duty only to the landowner(s) ... [which] includes discerning the grantor’s intent and refraining from approving deeds where a question exists concerning that intent.”
  
   LeCompte v. Acting Great Plains Reg’l Dir.,
  
  45 IBIA 135, 143 (2007). The actual determination of whether to approve a gift conveyance “is a matter within the discretion of BIA.”
  
   Id.
  
  While perhaps these regulations reflect a paternalistic mindset, the simple fact is that applicable federal law vests substantial discretion with the BIA to approve or reject gift transfers by Indians.
 

  Applying these regulations, the BIA acknowledged the special relationship between Smith and Miami Tribe—under § 152.25(d)—but found the partial transfer was still not in the long-range best interests of Smith or the other Reserve landowners—under § 152.23. In particular, the BIA found the transfer raised concerns regarding “tract management, competing interests between the tribe and the individual Indian landowners, and the potential for land use conflicts.”
  
   Id.
  
  Also, the recent history and gaming-related aspects of the Reserve “continuefd] to cause [BIA] concern over the propriety of such a transaction.”
  
   18
  

   Id.
  
  The BIA acknowledged Smith’s desire to benefit the tribe, but stated “the existing business lease with the tribe will accomplish this” because the lease “gives the Tribe the necessary tool to undertake the development of a gaming facility and improve the potential for sig
   
   *931
   
  nificant revenue for the Indian landowners.”
  
   Id.
  


  The BIA also noted its position that Indian landowners should “receive at least fair market value when disposing of property” and that Indian tribes should pay fair market value for land purchases “unless special circumstances warrant otherwise.” Aplt.App. at 133. While acknowledging the special relationship between Smith and the tribe, the BIA found there were no “special circumstances that would justify a gift of a portion of [Smith’s] undivided interest to the Tribe” rather than a sale of the interest.
  
   Id.
  


  In summary, the special relationship between Smith and the tribe did not overcome the BIA’s finding that “the proposed gift conveyance [was] not in the long-range best interest of either [Smith] or the other Indian owners of the allotment.”
  
   Id.
  


  Our review under the APA’s familiar arbitrary and capricious standard gives the BIA wide latitude to administer its duties under the regulatory scheme adopted by Congress. Our duty is “to ascertain whether the agency examined the relevant data and articulated a rational connection between the facts found and the decision made.”
  
   Citizens’ Comm. to Save Our Canyons v. Krueger,
  
  513 F.3d 1169, 1176 (10th Cir.2008) (quotation omitted). Therefore, “the ultimate standard of review is a narrow one [and we are] not empowered to substitute [our] judgment for that of the agency.”
  
   Utah Envtl. Congress v. Richmond,
  
  483 F.3d 1127, 1134 (10th Cir.2007) (quoting
  
   Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe,
  
  401 U.S. 402, 416, 91 S.Ct. 814, 28 L.Ed.2d 136 (1971)) (alteration in original). We may not second-guess the BIA so long as it acts within the boundaries set by Congress, and it has done so here.
 

  Under these principles, the BIA properly interpreted and applied its own regulations, §§ 152.23 and 152.25(d), both of which afford discretion to approve a land transfer. The BIA recognized the special relationship between Smith and the tribe. But a special relationship permits a gift; it does not mandate it.
  
   See
  
  25 C.F.R, § 152.25(d) (“Indian owners
  
   may convey
  
  ... restricted land .,. when some other special relationship exists....”) (emphasis added). A gift conveyance also “may be approved” if after a “careful examination” of the circumstances the BIA determines the transfer is “clearly justified” as being in the long-range best interest of the landowners.
  
   Id.
  
  § 152.23. There are no explicit factors the BIA must consider when making its determination. Nevertheless, the BIA explained its rationale for denying Smith’s application in some detail. Given those plausible grounds, we cannot substitute our judgment for the BIA’s considered judgment.
 

  The tribe claims the disjunctive “or” in § 152.23 requires the BIA to approve a gift when a special relationship exists under § 152.25(d)
  
   without
  
  performing a long-range best interests analysis. The government, in contrast, argues the BIA
  
   m,ust
  
  review a gift for the long-range best interests, even when the gift falls within § 152.25(d). Section 152.25(d), itself, imposes no limits on the BIA’s discretion to approve a gift. The BIA’s discretion is limited only by the general restriction that its decision not be arbitrary and capricious or contrary to law. Despite this, the BIA chooses to apply the long-range best interests analysis as a self-imposed limit to channel its discretion under § 152.25(d). That choice is neither plainly erroneous nor inconsistent with the regulation because it is a reasonable framework to guide the BIA’s otherwise unfettered discretion. Therefore, we defer to the BIA’s interpretation of its own regulation.
  
   See Plateau Mining,
  
  519 F.3d at 1192.
 

  The tribe also argues the consolidation policies set out in § 2216(a) and (b) of the
   
   *932
   
  ILCA reinforce the special relationship between Smith and the tribe is enough to compel approval of the transfer. But, as we discussed above, § 2216(a) does not apply because the tribe lacks jurisdiction over the Reserve. And § 2216(b) only provides that a gift
  
   “may
  
  be made” for less than fair market value if certain statutory conditions are met; not that it
  
   must
  
  occur. The decision is still within the discretion of the BIA and its consideration of the long-range best interests under § 152.23. If Congress intended to require the BIA to approve all transfers that qualified under §§ 2216(b) or 152.25(d) it certainly could have, but it did not.
 

  In addition, the BIA’s preference toward land transfers for fair market value does not run afoul of § 2216(b). Nothing in the statute abrogates the BIA’s discretionary review of gift transfers or mandates their approval. If anything, the statute provides some protection to the agency by immunizing “approval of a transaction” from allegations of “breach of trust by the Secretary.” § 2216(b)(l)(A)(ii),
 

  In short, the BIA’s denial of Smith’s application was a valid exercise of its administrative discretion. It was neither arbitrary nor capricious for the BIA to conclude the partial transfer of Smith’s property interest to the tribe was not in his or other Reserve landowners’ long-range best interests.
 


   Fractionation
  


  The BIA’s second reason for denying the gift, dovetailing with its best interests conclusion, was that it conflicted with the federal government’s policy opposing the creation of additional fractional interests in Indian lands.
 

  Fractionation of Indian lands is an unintended consequence of the federal government’s allotment policy, which allotted parcels of land to tribal members. As those members died, the land passed to their descendants and soon multiple owners took the place of the original allottee.
  
   See Babbitt v. Youpee,
  
  519 U.S. 234, 237-39, 117 S.Ct. 727, 136 L.Ed.2d 696 (1997) (discussing the fractionation problem). Even though the allotment policy ended in 1934, the “consequences of that policy— fractional property interests—persists, and make a substantial amount of Indian land uneconomic.” Conference of Western Attorneys General, American Indian Law Deskbook 120 (4th ed.2008);

  It is the
  
   policy of the United
  
  States—
 

  (1)
  
   to prevent the further fractionation
  
  of trust allotments made to Indians;
 

  (2) to consolidate fractional interests and ownership of those interests into usable parcels;
 

  (3) to consolidate fractional interests in a manner that enhances tribal sovereignty;
 

  (4) to promote tribal self-sufficiency and self-determination; and
 

  (5) to reverse the effects of the allotment policy on Indian tribes.
 

  Indian Land Consolidation Act Amendments of 2000, Pub.L. No. 106-462, § 102, 114 Stat.1991, 1992 (2000) (codified at 25 U.S.C. § 2201 note) (emphasis added). One goal of the ILCA was “to promote consolidation of existing fractional interests, not to create new fractional interests for tribes to purchase.”
  
   Downs,
  
  29 IBIA at 98. It is against this background that the BIA considered what effect Smith’s gift would have on fractionation of the Reserve.
 

  At the time of the BIA’s decision, it was not seriously contestable that Smith’s gift of only 1/3 of his interest would further contribute to the fractionation of the Reserve.
  
   20
  
  If approved, the gift would have divided Smith’s interest and made the tribe an additional landowner in the Reserve.
  
   21
  
  The BIA recognized that, in its experience, “highly fractionated ownership interests greatly complicate the [BIA’s] land management efforts and the successful discharge of the federal Government’s trust responsibility.” Aplt.App. at 133.
 

  When considering Smith’s application, the BIA relied on its analysis in
  
   Downs v. Acting Muskogee Area Director,
  
  29 IBIA 94 (1996),
  
   22
  
  where the BIA had previously denied a request to give an interest in the Reserve to Miami Tribe. The BIA found Smith’s gift presented the same issues as presented in
  
   Downs.
  


    23
   



  In
  
   Downs,
  
  the BIA denied the gift transfer because there was no special relationship—Downs was not a member of Miami Tribe—and, like here, the conveyance was not in Downs’s or the other landowners’ best interests from a
   
   *934
   
  “practical land management standpoint, nor as a sound estate planning strategy.”
  
   Id.
  
  at 96. The BIA determined the continued fractionation of the Reserve, and injection of a tribal ownership interest, would “present very significant tract management issues which would affect not only [Downs], but the other owners as well.”
  
   24
  

   Id.
  
  Despite being framed as a gift, the BIA also found Downs’s proposed conveyance was “obviously not a conveyance without compensation,” and expressed its “concern over the propriety of the proposed transaction.”
  
   Id.
  


  As in
  
   Downs,
  
  here, the BIA found “[c]onveying only 1/3 of [Smith’s] undivided interest in the allotment would add to, rather than eliminate, the further fractionation of individually-owned Indian lands.” Aplt.App. at 133-34. The transfer of only a portion of Smith’s interest (1) “would not serve to consolidate fractional interests and the ownership of those interest [sic] into usable parcels,” (2) “would not enhance tribal sovereignty or promote tribal self-sufficiency and self-determination over what can be accomplished through the lease,” and (3) “does not reverse the effects of the allotment policy on the Miami Tribe due to the off-reservation, out-of-state location of the tract.”
  
   Id.
  
  at 133. For these reasons, the BIA concluded Smith’s gift conveyance should be denied because it would conflict with federal government policy on fractionation.
 

  The district court concluded the BIA’s decision was “based upon the immediate, short-term effect of the proposed transfer” and failed to consider Smith’s proposed transfer “based upon the long-term impact on fractionation.”
  
   Miami Tribe of Okla.,
  
  374 F.Supp.2d 934, 941-42 (D.Kan.2005), The tribe had included the Reserve in its land consolidation plan approved by the BIA and was actively involved with the Reserve. The BIA’s “exclusive focus on the short-term impact” of Smith’s gift transfer on further fractionation of individually-owned Indian lands—in light of Miami Tribe’s connections and ties with the Reserve—convinced the court that the BIA “failed to consider an important aspect of a factor upon which it relied in making its decision.”
  
   Id.
  
  at 942.
 

  We disagree. The BIA gave proper consideration to the potential for additional fractionation of the Reserve. Specifically, it was concerned about “highly fractionated ownership interest greatly complicat[ing] the Bureau’s land management efforts ... [and] tract management, competing interests between the Tribe and the individual Indian landowners, and the potential for land use conflicts.” Aplt.App. at 133. And nothing suggests the BIA’s focus was solely on any short-term effects. The agency could conclude Smith’s gift did not further any of the goals listed in the United States’ policy on fractionation—enhancing tribal sovereignty, or promoting tribal self-sufficiency and self-determination,
  
   see
  
  25 U.S.C. § 2201 note—because the Reserve is outside of Miami Tribe’s territory in Oklahoma and the tribe has no jurisdiction over the Reserve. The BIA properly determined Smith’s gift would cause further fractionation of the Reserve by splitting Smith’s ownership interest and adding Miami Tribe as a partial landowner.
  
   25
  


 
   *935
   
  In sum, the BIA’s conclusion that Smith’s transfer would increase fractionation of the Reserve was not arbitrary and capricious, or contrary to law,
 

  III. Conclusion
 

  For the foregoing reasons, we VACATE the district court’s final judgment and the 2005 Order reversing the BIA, and we REMAND for further consideration of Smith’s application consistent with this opinion.

   . The Reserve is variously known as the Maria Christiana allotment, Miami Reserve No. 35, Miami 35, Allotment No. 35, and Maria Christiana Miami Reserve No. 35. We consider all to refer to the same 35-acre parcel of land in Miami County, Kansas.

   . There are two types of allotments: (1) a “trust allotment,” which is ""a parcel of land owned by the United States in trust for an Indian,” or (2) a ""restricted allotment,"" which is ""owned by an Indian subject to a restriction on alienation in the United States or its officials."" Cohen’s Handbook of Federal Indian Law § 16.03[1] (2005 ed.). A trust allotment is conveyed through a trust patent, under which the United States holds the land for a designated period in trust for the sole use and benefit of the allottee and conveys the land in unrestricted fee at the end of the trust period.
   
    See United States v. Bowling,
   
   256 U.S. 484, 486-87, 41 S.Ct. 561, 65 L.Ed. 1054 (1921). A restricted allotment, similarly, is conveyed through a land patent, under which the allottee holds the land in fee with a restriction on alienation.
   
    See id.
   
   at 487, 41 S.Ct. 561. The Reserve’s land patent for the restricted allotment provided the land ""shall never be sold or conveyed by the grantee or her heirs without the consent of the Secretary of the Interior, for the time being.”

   . Over time, the original 200-acre allotment dwindled to its current size of 35 acres. After Maria Christiana DeRome's death in 1860, her family sold 120 acres. In 1986, based on a claim of adverse possession, a court partitioned the remaining 80 acres, granting 45 acres to Midwest Investment Properties, Inc. and leaving 35 acres to the Indian landowners in restricted fee.

   . Despite removing its command to approve the application, the district court expected the BIA's actions on remand to be ""consistent” with the 2005 Order.
  


   11
  

   .At oral argument, the tribe asserted the BIA should have denied the conveyance a second time if it disagreed with the 2005 Order and then challenged the order through a contempt proceeding. We look unfavorably on forcing an agency to suffer a contempt citation as a vehicle for an appellate challenge to a district court’s administrative-remand order.

(Its only other choice would be to violate the court's order and risk contempt, which we do not think Congress, in enacting § 1291, intended to encourage, and which the SEC has not intimated it will do.)”); 15B Wright & Miller, Federal Practice & Procedure § 3914.32 (2d ed.) (“[Cjourts also note the unseemliness of forcing a government agency to act in contempt so as to force an opportunity for immediate appeal.'').

   15
  

   . The two outstanding, unresolved counts pending before the district court distinguish this case from the practical finality line of cases. In those cases, where we asserted jurisdiction and reviewed administrative-remand orders under the practical finality exception, all outstanding issues had been resolved by the district court.
   
    See Baca-Prieto,
   
   95 F.3d at 1008;
   
    Cotton Petroleum,
   
   870 F.2d at 1521. When denying the government's request for a Rule 54(b) judgment, the district court here noted there would be further proceedings and stated the unresolved counts would likely be affected by the BIA’s decision on remand.
  


   16
  

   . Even if
   
    Miami IV
   
   were not on point, the case law does not support the proposition that adoption of a landowner by a tribe confers jurisdiction.
   
    See United States v. Mazurie,
   
   419 U.S. 544, 95 S.Ct. 710, 42 L.Ed.2d 706 (1975). The tribe cannot create Indian reservation lands ex nihilo by adopting landowners into the tribe and claiming all of the new member’s property.
  


   17
  

   . Even if we found § 2216(a) applied, the BIA would still retain its discretion to deny the application. In that situation, while a closer question, the BIA would properly be within its discretion if it denied Smith’s application for any of the reasons articulated in its regulations. The policy preference in § 2216(a) encourages the consolidation of land ownership but does not mandate it.
  


   18
  

   . The BIA received an opinion from a Realty Officer (RO) stating it could not recommend approval of Smith’s gift conveyance because the transfer was not in Smith’s or other individual landowners' long-range best interest or in compliance with the federal government’s policy on fractionated interests.
   
    See
   
   Aplt. App. at 143-46. The RO provided detail regarding gaming activities and the Reserve. The RO was not convinced the transaction was one without the expectation of compensation due to the recent history and gaming implications of the Reserve.

    See
   
   Conference of Western Attorneys General.
   
    supra,
   
   at 120-21 (4th ed.2008) (quotation omitted):
  

   A fractional property interest is a small, undivided interest in a tract of land held in common with a number of other small interests. When the original owners of allotments died, their heirs received joint undivided interests in the original allotment. Thus 40-, 80-, and 160-acre parcels became splintered into multiple undivided interests in land, with some parcels having hundreds, and many parcels having dozens, of owners. Because the land was held in trust and often could not be alienated or partitioned, the fractionation problem grew and grew over time.... Fractionated land interferes with comprehensive and constructive tribal land use plans. It presents financing barriers, and the costs of assembling sites or pooling rights for natural resource development and other projects may be unsurmountable. Consequently, the land is usually leased rather than improved and used by the owners. At times, it is impossible to secure agreement among all owners to lease and, as a result, valuable land is in a state of quasi-abandonment.
  


   20
  

   . As we have noted, in 2006 the tribe acquired a 3/19 remainder interest in the Reserve subject to Smith's life estate. However, the tribe had not yet obtained this interest when the BIA considered, and denied, Smith’s application in 2002.
  


   21
  

   . The precise number of landowners is unclear. The government states there are currently over 20 different Reserve landowners. Aplt. Br. at 3. However, as of June 2009, the BIA listed over 65 separate fee or trust interests held in the Reserve.
   
    See

   . When the IBIA affirmed the BIA's decision, it noted Smith’s request for a gift conveyance was similar to that made in

   Smith and Miami Tribe attempted to offer new evidence to the IBIA during their appeal that (1) a plan existed to consolidate the fractional interests of the heirs to the allotments, and (2) heirs representing 25% of the interests had agreed to transfer their interests to the tribe. The new evidence of a consolidation plan was offered to distinguish Smith's situation from
   
    Downs
   
   with respect to the ILCA fractionation considerations. The IBIA declined to consider this information because it was not presented to the BIA and concluded Smith and the tribe failed to distinguish their case from
   
    Downs
   
   with respect to fractionation.

   , The BIA concluded managing the Reserve was difficult because of its distance from BIA locations and other trust or restricted lands, and further fractionation of ownership would only make the situation more difficult. Also, the BIA noted that, generally, tribes and individual owners often have competing interests in the use of land when the tribes own only a small interest. Miami Tribe had plans to establish gaming on the reserve, but this plan was speculative and BIA determined the best use of the land was agricultural.

   . Subsequent to the BIA’s denial of Smith's application and the 2005 Order, Miami Tribe

   acquired a 3/19 remainder interest in the Reserve subject to Smith's beneficial life estate. Aplt.App. at 170;

DECISION and ORDER
MYRON L. GORDON, District Judge.
The defendant, Northern Upholstery, Inc., has brought a motion for an order dismissing the action or, alternatively, to quash the return of the service of the summons upon it. The action was originally commenced in December, 1969. The plaintiffs seek to recover damages as a result of an accident involving an allegedly defective “mobile tracked vehicle.”
On January 22, 1971, the court granted plaintiffs’ motion to amend the summons and complaint to add Northern Upholstery as an additional party defendant. On February 4, 1971, service of the amended summons and complaint purportedly was made on Northern Upholstery, Inc., by the marshal’s serving one “Jim Ploof, Mgr.” at Roseau, Minnesota. Although there is an affidavit before the court that Mr. Ploof is not “an employee, agent or officer” of Northern Upholstery, Inc., any deficiency in that attempted service would not appear to be fatal because subsequently, on April 19, 1971, after the instant motion was filed, the marshal served the amended summons and complaint upon one “Dale Amundson, Sec. & Treas.” at Roseau, Minnesota. Northern Upholstery, Inc. has not contended that the latter service was made upon one not authorized to receive it.
Northern Upholstery also urges that the service should be quashed because it is a Minnesota corporation and has not had minimum contacts with the state of Wisconsin. In an affidavit, the movant’s vice-president has averred:
“* * * that said Northern Upholstery, Inc. is not licensed to do busi*541ness in the state of Wisconsin and that it has done no business in the state of Wisconsin at any time, nor at any place mentioned in the Complaint herein, nor has said defendant, Northern Upholstery, Inc., solicited any business whatsoever in the state of Wisconsin, nor has it had any contact whatsoever with the plaintiffs herein at any time or at any place mentioned in said Complaint.”
Unfortunately, the court does not have the benefit of any responsive memorandum or any counter-affidavits from the plaintiffs in this case. This stems from the fact that the original briefing schedule (which required that the plaintiffs’ brief be filed by April 26, 1971) was extended at the plaintiffs’ request to June 18, 1971. The original extension was granted upon the statement of plaintiffs’ counsel that they wanted to conduct discovery regarding the motion. Without any extension being thereafter granted by the court, plaintiffs’ counsel failed to file any memoranda or supporting authorities on the date they were due, namely June 18, 1971.
The instant case is now over a year and a half old. At a status report conference held on December 1, 1970, the court directed counsel to complete their discovery within 120 days thereafter. Under all the circumstances, I concluded that an additional extension of time in which to file a responsive brief should not be granted to the plaintiffs. If the court is to control its calendar, it must not subscribe to delays such as would occur in this matter if any further extensions were permitted.
Since the defendant, Northern Upholstery, Inc., was served outside of the territorial limits of this state, the court must determine, upon the motion to quash, whether such service complied with legal requirements. Mr. Hetteen’s affidavit stands uncontradicted; it asserts that Northern Upholstery, Inc. did not do business in Wisconsin. There is nothing before the court to suggest that service was sufficient under Rule 4(d) (7), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, or under the Wisconsin long-arm statute, Sec. 262.05(1) (d), which provides that service can be had over a foreign corporation which:
“Is engaged in substantial and not isolated activities within this state, whether such activities are wholly interstate, intrastate, or otherwise.”
In Travelers Ins. Co. v. George McArthur & Sons, 25 Wis.2d 197, 203, 130 N.W.2d 852, 854 (1964), the court said: “* * * this subsection [262.05]
contemplates a requirement similar to that of ‘doing business’ within the state which requires not just an isolated contact but ‘substantial activities’ which are ‘continuous and systematic.’ ”
The need for significant contact between the defendant and the state was discussed in International Shoe Co. v. State of Washington, 326 U.S. 310, 66 S.Ct. 154, 90 L.Ed. 95 (1945). See also Trippe Manufacturing Company v. Spencer Gifts, Inc., 270 F.2d 821 (7th Cir. 1959); Uni-Pak, Inc. v. Formex Corporation, 300 F.Supp. 527 (E.D.Wis.1969). There is applicable here what this court said in the latter case at p. 528:
“Section 262.05 is quite broad in scope, but each of its subsections demands some meaningful contact between the defendant and the state. Under the terms of the statute, mere preliminary negotiations at the time of the signing of the contract between two foreign corporations, without more, would not be sufficient. For example, subsection (1) permits the court to assume jurisdiction over a foreign corporation which, at the time the action is commenced, is ‘engaged in substantial and not isolated activities within this state * * (emphasis added). No other portion of § 262.05 authorizes jurisdiction upon the facts in this case.”
It is clear that the materials now before the court support Northern Uphol*542stery’s contention that service upon it was improper. Accordingly, its motion to quash the service of the summons must be granted.
Now, therefore, it is ordered that the motion of the defendant, Northern Upholstery, Inc., to quash the service of the summons upon it be and hereby is granted.
And it is also ordered that this action against said defendant, Northern Upholstery, Inc., be and hereby is dismissed.

Madison Hammond and His Wife, Tura Hammond.","Processioning proceeding under G.S., ch. 38, to locate a disputed boundary line between adjoining property owners, here on former appeal.Cornelison v. Hammond, 224 N.C. 757.
After the pleadings were read the court, on motion of defendants, required plaintiffs to elect which line as shown on the map they contend is the true dividing line. Plaintiffs, in response thereto, announced that they contend the line from Black A to Black B is the true line. At the conclusion of the evidence for the plaintiffs, defendants moved for judgment of nonsuit. The court ""being of the opinion that there was not sufficient evidence to be submitted to the jury as to the location of the *Page 536 
line from Black A to Black B on the map, as claimed by plaintiffs,"" allowed the motion and entered judgment dismissing the action at the cost of plaintiffs. Plaintiffs excepted and appealed.
When, in a processioning proceeding under G.S., ch. 38, it is made to appear that there is a bona fide dispute between the owners as to the true location of the boundary line between adjoining tracts of land, may be cause be dismissed as in case of nonsuit? The answer is no.
The proceeding authorized by G.S., ch. 38, is an in rem proceeding. The petitioner is required to make the adjoining landowner party defendant and to allege only ""facts sufficient to constitute the location"" of the disputed line as claimed by him. If the respondent fails to answer, ""judgment shall be given establishing the line according to petition."" If answer denies the location as alleged, a surveyor is appointed. He makes report to the clerk who then hears the cause and locates the line. From his order either party may appeal. G.S., 38-3.
Its purpose is to judicially determine the location of a disputed boundary line between adjoining tracts of land and the gravamen of the cause of action is the existence of a controversy between plaintiffs and defendants as to the true location of the line dividing the lands owned by plaintiffs and those owned by defendants.
When it is made to appear that such controversy exists, plaintiffs have a legal right to have the line ascertained and fixed by judicial decree even though, finally, it may be located as contended by defendants.
When the cause is heard on appeal, unless the pleadings are complicated by other allegations, only one issue arises — where is the true location of the dividing line between the lands of the plaintiffs and those of the defendants? Greer v. Hayes, 216 N.C. 396, 5 S.E.2d 169;Huffman v. Pearson, 222 N.C. 193, 22 S.E.2d 440; McCanless v.Ballard, 222 N.C. 701, 24 S.E.2d 525.
It is the province of the jury to locate the line. It is for them to say, on the conflicting testimony and under the instructions of the court, where the line is. Greer v. Hayes, supra; Clegg v. Canady, 217 N.C. 433,8 S.E.2d 246; Huffman v. Pearson, supra; McCanless v. Ballard, supra.
If the plaintiffs are unable to show by the greater weight of evidence the location of the true dividing line at a point more favorable to them than the line as contended by the defendants, the jury should answer the *Page 537 
issue in accord with the contentions of the defendants. Greer v. Hayes,supra; Boone v. Collins, 202 N.C. 12, 161 S.E. 543. But, in the absence of an agreement, this does not imply that the jury must answer the issue either as contended by plaintiffs or as contended by defendants. McCanlessv. Ballard, supra. They, by their answer to the issue, may fix the location wherever the evidence, in their opinion, justifies.
It is admitted that plaintiffs and defendants own adjoining tracts of land. That a dispute exists as to the true location of the boundary line between these tracts is quite evident. The one issue — where is the true boundary line — is unanswered. The dispute with all its precarious potentialities still is undetermined. The statute is expressly designed to provide a means of settlement by an orderly proceeding in court and the plaintiffs, as a matter of right, are entitled to have the issue answered by a jury so that the controversy may be brought to an end by judicial decree. Hence the cause should not be dismissed as in case of nonsuit. Jackson v. Williams, 152 N.C. 203, 67 S.E. 755; Geddie v.Williams, 189 N.C. 333, 127 S.E. 423.
We do not mean to imply that the cause may not be dismissed when it is made to appear that (1) there are fatal irregularities or defects on the face of the record, Jackson v. Williams, supra, or (2) no bona fide dispute exists, Lowder v. Smith, 201 N.C. 642, 161 S.E. 223; Wood v. Hughes,195 N.C. 185, 141 S.E. 569, or (3) plaintiffs and defendants are not the owners of adjoining tracts. Clegg v. Canady, supra; McCanless v.Ballard, supra.

9516907,2003669,324375,Marriage of Beckler v. Hart,"In Re Marriage of Yon Maxwell BECKLER, Appellant-Respondent, v. Diane Louise Beckler HART, Appellee-Petitioner","
OPINION
HOFFMAN, Judge.
Appellant-respondent Yon Maxwell Beck-ler (Beckler) appeals from the granting of his petition to declare his child emancipated. The facts relevant to this appeal are summarized below.
On February 25, 1980, the Allen County court issued a decree dissolving the marriage of Beckler and Diane Louise Beckler Hart (Hart). Hart was granted custody of their minor child, and Beckler was ordered to pay child support in the amount of $31.50 per week. On or about January 22, 1992, pursuant to a wage withholding order, Beckler's employer was ordered to withhold from his pay $51.50 per week, $31.50 for child support and $20.00 to be applied to an arrearage of $6,342.00.
Beckler filed a petition to declare the child emancipated and to apply support paid after the date of emancipation to the arrearage on June 21, 1994. After a hearing, the trial court entered an order which found the child was emancipated having removed herself from her custodial parent Hart's residence in April of 1998. The court also ordered the support order terminated, effective June 21, 1994, the date Beckler had filed his petition. Beckler now appeals.
*1389The sole issue raised on review is whether the trial court, upon the granting of his petition to declare the child emancipated, erred in holding Beckler's support obligation terminated as of the date the petition was filed, rather than the date the child was found to have been emancipated.
Duties of proper child support are committed to the trial court's sound disceretion and will be disturbed only for an abuse of that discretion or if contrary to Olson v. Olson, 445 N.E.2d 1386, 1388 (Ind.Ct.App.1983). Emancipation terminates the obligation of the noneustodial parent to support the child and frees the child from the care, custody, and control of his or her parents. Brown v. Brown, 581 N.E.2d 1260, 1263, n. 1 (Ind.Ct.App.1991). What constitutes emaneci-pation of a minor child is a question of law, but whether there has been an emancipation is a question of fact. Free v. Free, 581 N.E.2d 996, 997 (Ind.Ct.App.1991). As a general rule, the obligated parent's duty to support a child ceases upon the happening of one of two events: 1) the child's emancipation while yet a minor; or 2) upon the child reaching the full age of 21 years. Brown, 581 N.E.2d at 1268.
IND.CODE § 31-1-11.5-12(d) (1998 Ed.) provides conditions for emancipation and further provides ""child support terminates upon the court finding that the conditions prescribed in this subdivision exist[.]"" See In re Marriage of Johnson, 625 N.E2d 1331, 1333-1334 (Ind.Ct.App.1993). In the present case, the trial court explicitly found that the child was fully self-supporting; had removed herself from the Hart's residence in April of 1993; and had not been under the care or control of either parent since that time. Neither party disputes the fact that the child has been emancipated since April 20, 1993.
Beckler asserts that the trial court abused its discretion in ordering he was obligated to continue child support payments up to the date the petition was filed, rather than the actual date the child became emancipated. Relying on IND.CODE § 31-2-11-12 (1993 Ed.), Hart counters that using the date of emancipation, rather than the date the petition was filed, would constitute an impermissible retroactive modification of an obli-gor's duty to make child support payments.
In Donegan v. Donegan, 605 N.E.2d 132 (Ind.1992), our supreme court stated that unlike a claim of change of circumstances requiring modification of child support, an assertion of emancipation is deemed effective as of the date of emancipation, rather than the date of filing. Id. at 188. The court further noted that terminating a parental support obligation due to emancipation of a minor child does not constitute an impermissible retroactive modification of a support order. Id.; Ross v. Ross, 397 N.E.2d 1066, 1069 (Ind.Ct.App.1979) (emancipation terminates legal force of the support order by terminating the parental obligation and is, therefore, not contrary to case law requiring modifications to be prospective); see also Kirchoff v. Kirchoff, 619 N.E.2d 592, 596 (Ind.Ct.App.1993) (although modification of child support order due to child's emancipation can be effective as of the date of emancipation, if one or more unemancipated children are also covered by the support order, obligated parent's duty to support the remaining minor children according to terms of original support order continues in same manner, amount, and time required by the original order until the parent's duty to support unemancipated children is modified by the trial court). Thus, the trial court abused its discretion in concluding that Beckler was obligated to continue his support payments after the date of the child's emancipation.
Additionally, as Beckler recognizes, support payments made after the date of emancipation constitute an overpayment of support. A child support overpayment cannot be applied prospectively to support not due at the time of the overpayment. Holy v. Lanning, 552 N.E.2d 44, 45 (Ind.Ct.App.1990). However, the rationale for this rule is totally inapplicable to an arrearage that exists at the time of the overpayment. As explained by this Court:
""A rule which failed to eredit overpay-ments against an existing arrearage would create a disincentive for obligated parents to voluntarily fulfill their delinquent child support obligations. It would be benefit no one to require a judicial proceeding *1390reducing the arrearage to judgment before the obligated parent could be credited for payments against the arrearage. Furthermore, the only reasonable inference from an overpayment, standing alone and made at the time an arrearage exists, is that it is a payment on the arrearage.""
Id. at 46 (non-custodial parent entitled to have child support overpayments credited against his pre-existing child support arrear-age); cf. Olson, 445 N.E.2d at 1389 (child support payments not required for the benefit of children must be considered a gratuity or a voluntary contribution; they should not be considered a prepayment of the support obligation nor should they be credited against arrearage due with respect to other children). In the present case, any overpayment of support should be credited only against any pre-existing child support ar-rearage Beckler may have acerued as of the date of the child's emancipation. The judgment of the trial court is reversed and remanded with instructions to terminate the support order as of the date the child was found to be emancipated and to apply the overpayment to Beckler's support arrearage.
Reversed and remanded.

  FINNEGAN, Circuit Judge.
 

  On September 11, 1950, Carolina Motor Express Lines, Inc., a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Indiana, filed in the District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division, its
   
   *90
   
  verified petition for an arrangement under Chapter XI of the Bankruptcy Act. The petition alleged that the business of the corporate debtor is the ownership, leasing and operation of trucks, and the maintenance of a general trucking business for hire; that it had its principal place of business in Chicago, Cook County, Illinois, for the longer portion of the six months period immediately preceding the filing of the petition than in any other judicial district. It alleged further that the corporate debtor was and is unable to pay its debts as they mature, and that it desired to propose an arrangement with its unsecured creditors under Chapter XI of the Bankruptcy Act, and that the filing of the petition had been duly authorized by the shareholders and directors of the corporate debtor. The petition was signed and verified by the president of the corporate debtor. No schedules, no statement of executory contracts, no statement of affairs, and no plan of arrangement, as required by secs. 323 and 324 of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C.A. §§ 723, 724, accompanied said petition, nor were they filed therewith or at any previous time.
 

  However, on the very date of filing, September 11, 1950, the District Court ordered that leave be granted to file said petition “without schedules, statement of executory contracts, statement of affairs and plan of arrangement.” On the same day the court entered an order which declared : “It appearing to the court that the debtor has not had opportunity to prepare the detailed information necessary to complete its schedules, the statement of affairs, its statement of executory contracts, and its plan of arrangement, and for good cause shown. It is ordered that the debtor be granted 30 days from this date within which to file its schedules, etc.” (The record discloses that on October 11, 1950, within the time allowed by the order, the corporate debtor filed its plan of arrangement, statement of executory contracts, statement of affairs and schedules.)
 

  A third order was entered by the District Court on September 11, 1950, in it the court states that having examined the petition and being fully advised in the premises, it finds that Carolina Motor Express Lines, Inc. is a debtor within Chapter XI, sec. 306(3), 11 U.S.C.A. § 706, of the Bankruptcy Act, and that the petition has been properly filed under Chapter XI, sec. 322 of said Act, 11 U.S.C.A. § 722, and continued debtor in control of assets.
 

  On September 19, 1950, Blue & White Service, Inc., et al., an Indiana corporation, Marshall E. Alexander, Jr., doing business as Electric Accounting Service, and Tire Service Company, a division of Cooper Industries, Inc., of Indianapolis, Indiana, three creditors of the corporate debtor, filed their petition to vacate the order of September 11, 1950, finding that its petition for arrangement had been properly filed, and to dismiss the proceedings for lack of jurisdiction because, it was charged, the corporate debtor’s principal place of business had not been in the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division, for a longer portion of the six months preceding the filing of the petition than in any other judicial district. It.alleged that the debtor’s principal place of business during such period had been and was then in Indianapolis, Indiana. On September 26, 1950, the same creditors filed an amended petition to vacate the order finding that the petition of corporate debtor was properly filed and to dismiss the proceedings. As an additional ground for dismissing debtor’s petition, it was charged in this amendment that the petition for arrangement did not set forth the provisions of the plan of arrangement as required by the Bankruptcy Act, and that said petition for arrangement was not accompanied by a statement of debtor’s executory contracts, nor by schedules, nor statement of affairs.
 

  The record filed in this appeal discloses no answer on behalf of the corporate debtor to the amended petition of September 26, 1950. However, it does appear that the corporate debtor did,' on September 22, 1950, answer the original petition to vacate the order of September 11, and to dismiss the petition for arrangement. In its answer the corporate debtor reaffirmed that its principal place of business during the six months preceding the filing of its petition for arrangement was at Chicago, Cook
   
   *91
   
  County, Illinois, for a longer period than in any other judicial district.
 

  The proceedings were referred to a referee in bankruptcy who, on November 15, 1950, filed his memorandum and order denying the prayers of the amended petition to vacate the orders and to dismiss the petition. On petition for review, the order of the referee was affirmed and the prayers of the amended petition were denied. This appeal followed.
 

  In seeking a reversal of the order of the District Court, the appellants here present the same contentions urged in the lower court. They are, first — that the principal place of business was not in Chicago, Cook County, Illinois, for the period of time, preceding the filing of the petition for arrangement, required by the Bankruptcy Act; and second — that the District Court had no jurisdiction over the proceedings for an arrangement because the corporate debtor’s original petition failed to allege facts required by the statute and was not accompanied by schedules, statement of affairs, list of executory contracts, and a plan of arrangement.
 

  We propose to consider the contentions in the order listed.
 

  As we have pointed out, the petition of the corporate debtor avers that it has and has had its principal place of business in the City of Chicago, County of Cook, Illinois, within the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division, for a longer portion of the six months immediately preceding its filing than in any other judicial district. It is also alleged therein that its filing had been authorized by its shareholders and directors. The allegation that the petition was thus authorized to be filed in Chicago because that city had been its principal place of business for ÃÂ¡ longer portion of the six months immediately preceding than any other place in a different judicial district, created a
  
   prima facie
  
  presumption that Chicago was and had been its principal place of business during such period. The burden of overcoming this presumption was upon the creditors who sought to defeat jurisdiction. In re Hudson River Navigation Corp., 2 Cir., 59 F.2d 971.
 

  The jurisdiction of the District Court in the case at bar is dependent upon a question of fact — did the corporate debtor have its principal place of business at Chicago for a longer portion of the six months next preceding the filing of its petition than in any other judicial district? Appellants urge that it did not. However, the referee determined the fact adversely to appellants, and his finding was sustained and approved by the District Court. We have examined the evidence adduced on the issue and are convinced that the finding of the lower court is justified by substantial evidence. Chicago Bank of Commerce v. Carter, 8 Cir., 61 F.2d 986.
 

  In our opinion, however, the second contention of appellants is decisive of this appeal. The petition for arrangement here involved was filed pursuant to Chapter XI, secs. 322, 323 and 324 of the Bankruptcy Act, which are as follows:
 

  Sec. 322. “If no bankruptcy proceeding is pending, a debtor may file an original petition under this chapter with the court which would have jurisdiction of a petition for his adjudication.” 11 U.S.C.A. § 722.
 

  Sec. 323. “A petition filed under this chapter shall state that the debtor is insolvent or unable to pay his debts as they mature, and shall set forth the provisions of the arrangement proposed by him.” 11 U.S.C.A. § 723.
 

  Sec. 324. “The petition shall be accompanied by—
 

  “(1) a statement of the executory contracts of the debtor;
 

  “(2) the schedules and statement of affairs, if not previously filed; and
 

  “(3) payment to the clerk of the fees, if not already paid, required by this title.” 11 U.S.C.A. § 724.
 

  These sections of Chapter XI were incorporated into our bankruptcy statutes by the Act of June 22, 1938, commonly known as the Chandler Act. That Act amended certain specified sections of the Act of 1898, establishing a uniform system of bankruptcy throughout the United States, as amended; and incorporated certain of the amended sections as Chapters X, XI, XII, XIII and XIV of the Bankruptcy Act.
   
   *92
   
  Among the sections amended, and as amended incorporated into the Bankruptcy Statute as section XI by the’ Chandler Act, were sections 73 and 74.
 

  Section 74 originated in the Act of March 3, 1933, which provided that courts of bankruptcy should have and exercise additional jurisdiction in proceedings for the relief of debtors.
 

  It provided in part as follows, 47 St. at large, p. 1467, sec. 74:
 

  “Compositions and extensions—
 

  “(a) Any person, excepting a corporation may file a petition, or, in an involuntary proceeding before adjudication, an answer within the time limited by section 18(b) of this Act, accompanied in either case,
  
   unless further time is granted,
  
  by his schedules, stating that he is insolvent or unable to meet his debts as they mature, and that he desires to effect a composition or an extension of time to pay his debts.”
 

  That portion of sec. 74 (which we have italicized) in the above quotation, justified the holding that bankruptcy courts, by that section, were given the power to extend the time within which schedules and plans for arrangement might be filed. However, Congress saw fit in enacting the Chandler Act to delete the italicized words. There is, therefore, no provision in secs. 323 and 324, 11 U.S.C.A. §§ 723, 724, as they now stand, which expressly or by implication gives to our district courts power or authority to extend the time for filing the plan of arrangement proposed by the debtor, or the statement of his executory contracts, or the schedules and statement of affairs required by the Act.
 

  Section 7(8) of the Bankruptcy Act of 1898, regarding the duties of a bankrupt, providing that a voluntary bankrupt shall prepare, make oath to and file with his petition a schedule of his property showing the amount and kind of property, the location thereof, and its money value in detail, and a list of all his creditors and the amount due and claimed by each, the consideration thereof, the securities, if any, held by them, etc., all in triplicate, one for the clerk, one for the referee, and one for the trustee, was one of the specific sections amended by the Chandler Act of June 22, 1938.
 

  The amendment added to the section, in the 8th clause thereof, the following language: “Provided, That the court may for cause shown grant further time for the filing of such schedules if, with his petition in a voluntary proceeding * * * the bankrupt files a list of all such creditors and their addresses.” Sec. 7(a)(8) of the Bankruptcy Act as amended. 11 U.S.C.A. § 25(8).
 

  In our opinion this amendment to Sec. 7 authorizes the district courts to grant further time for filing schedules only in cases involving voluntary and involuntary petitions in bankruptcy. It has no application to proceedings for the settlement, satisfaction or extension of time of payment of unsecured debts.
 

  The fact that in the Chandler Act, as we have already pointed out, Congress deleted from sec. 74 of the Bankruptcy Act, regarding petitions for arrangement, the power there given district courts to extend the time for filing schedules and statements required in such proceedings, forces the conclusion that the District Court has no power to extend the time for filing such plans, statements and schedules in arrangement proceedings.
 

  It should also be pointed out that in the case at bar, the debtor’s petition for arrangement did not have with the petition a list of all its creditors and their addresses. It therefore appears that the order of the District Court of September 11, 1950, was improvidently entered. This record discloses that no plan of arrangement was filed with debtor’s petition, no statement of its affairs, no schedules accompanied such petition, there is therefore no question of amending an insufficient or defective plan, statement, or schedule. On this record there was nothing to amend.
 

  Neither appellant nor appellee has been able to find a case decisive of the point here involved. Our own search has been likewise unsuccessful. There is dictum in Securities & Exchange Commission v. United States Realty & Improvement Co., 310 U.S. 434, and also In re Kovell Oil Co.,
   
   *93
   
  D.C., 31 F.Supp. 319, which tends to support the view we have expressed. The appellee cites In re Greaves, D.C., Miss., 1937, 37 A.B.R., N.S., 461, which was decided before the enactment of the Chandler Act, and offers no aid.
 

  However, it does appear that well and favorably known commentators in bankruptcy matters have come to the same conclusion.
 

  Discussing Secs. 323-324 of the Bankruptcy Act, 8 Collier on Bankruptcy (14th Ed.1941) Sec. 4.06, p. 310 says: “Where schedules are required to be filed they must accompany the petition; there is no authority to extend the time for filing schedules, as there is in proceedings under Chapters I to VII.”
 

  On the same matter, Remington on Bankruptcy, par. 3064.7, at p. 186, says: “The schedules and statement of affairs must accompany the petition, and the court has no longer the discretionary power to grant an extension of time for filing the schedules.”
 

  We regard as totally immaterial the fact that the corporate debtor, within the time allowed by the trial court, did actually file its plan of arrangement, statement of affairs, list of executory contracts and schedules. The court had no authority to enter the order of September 11, 1950, extending the time for filing such documents. Hence plans, lists and schedules filed thereunder should be disregarded.
 

  The order of the District Court is reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.

4962428,5142343,60455865,Murphy v. City of Duquesne,"Craig MURPHY v. CITY OF DUQUESNE, City of Duquesne Police Department and Richard Adams and Richard S. Adams and Daniel C. Theim","
OPINION BY
Judge LEAVITT.
Craig Murphy appeals an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County (trial court) dismissing his tort claim against the City of Duquesne Police Department, Chief of Police Richard Adams, Lieutenant Richard Scott Adams and Officer Daniel C. Theim (collectively Duquesne). The trial court granted summary judgment to Duquesne because it concluded that there is no cognizable cause of action for holding a municipality and its individual police officers liable in damages where they do not investigate and prosecute criminal activity with the degree of zeal satisfactory to plaintiff. Finding no error, we affirm.
Murphy’s pro se complaint presents a single-count claim in negligence and is based upon two incidents. According to the facts as pled, the first incident occurred on April 3, 2002, when Murphy informed the police department that he had been robbed at gunpoint. The next day, Murphy went to the police station where he identified the suspect from photographs. Two days later, Officer Theim notified Murphy that it had recovered some of the stolen property along with the firearm believed to have been used in the crime. Murphy identified the stolen property and the weapon. Although Officer Theim informed Murphy that an attempt had been made to arrest the suspect, it did not happen. The second incident occurred on November 9, 2002, when Murphy notified the police department that a bullet had been shot through the window of his home. The bullet was retrieved and identified by Officer Legan as a nine-millimeter bullet. Lieutenant Adams informed Murphy that the police knew who had fired the shot. However, as with the first incident, no attempt was made to arrest this suspect.
In response to Murphy’s complaint, Du-quesne filed an answer with new matter, denying the above-recited allegations. Duquesne specifically denied that it had failed to arrest the suspect in the April 3, 2002, robbery, and denied that the individual who fired into Murphy’s home had been identified.
After filing its answer, Duquesne deposed Murphy, during which he admitted that the suspect in the April 3, 2002, robbery had been arrested and tried. During the trial, the defendant fled the courthouse but was captured, incarcerated and eventually pled guilty to the robbery. At the time of Murphy’s deposition on October 25, 2004, this individual was still incarcerated. Murphy also admitted in the deposition that after the November 9, 2002, shooting incident, police officers did a prompt investigation and advised Murphy of their findings: i.e., the bullet was fired in an incident unrelated to Murphy. Specifically, they concluded the bullet that went through Murphy’s window was simply the *678result of poor aim by an unidentified individual.
Thereafter, Duquesne filed a motion for summary judgment, asserting that the evidence did not show that Duquesne failed to do its job. Even so, Duquesne argued that Murphy failed to state a cause of action that fell within one of the exceptions to governmental immunity in the statute popularly called the Political Subdivision Tort Claims Act1 (Tort Claims Act). Argument on the motion for summary judgment was heard on June 9, 2005, but Murphy did not appear. The trial court granted summary judgment dismissing Murphy’s complaint with prejudice.2 This appeal followed.3
On appeal,4 Murphy presents three issues, which are reordered for this analysis. First, Murphy contends that the trial court erred in dismissing his complaint in light of the admissions of willful misconduct made by police officers. Second, he contends that the trial court erred in its application of the Tort Claims Act. Third, Murphy contends that the trial court abused its discretion by dismissing his complaint.
We consider, first, Murphy’s contention that Duquesne failed to deny specific averments of police misconduct, which the trial court then failed to recognize as binding admissions. In support, Murphy directs this Court to First Wisconsin Trust Company v. Strausser, 439 Pa.Super. 192, 653 A.2d 688 (1995), a mortgage foreclosure case holding that general denials in an answer may be considered an admission of those facts. As a mortgage foreclosure case, Strausser is inapplicable here, where we consider a claim for tort damages. Even assuming, arguendo, that Duquesne’s denials were general, not specific, they were nevertheless satisfactory. General denials in an answer to a tort complaint satisfy the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure and will not be deemed admissions, except under certain exceptions not applicable here. Pa.R.C.P. No. 1029(e).5 Murphy’s argument lacks any merit.
*679Murphy’s second issue is equally meritless. Murphy contends that governmental immunity cannot protect police officers who “willfully and maliciously allowed dangerous criminals to commit assault, and shootings that almost murdered appellant.” Appellant’s Brief at 10. Murphy argues from the premise that the police intended to cause Murphy emotional distress. The record, however, does not support this claim; it contradicts it.
To maintain a negligence action against a local agency or its employees, the plaintiff must establish a common law, or statutory, cause of action against the agency or employee.6 The necessary elements of any negligence claim are: (1) a duty owed by defendant to plaintiff; (2) a failure by defendant to conform his conduct to the standard of care required; (3) a causal connection between the conduct and the resulting injury; and (4) actual loss or damage by plaintiff. Morena v. South Hills Health System, 501 Pa. 634, 642 n. 5, 462 A.2d 680, 684 n. 5 (1983). Duty, in any given situation, is predicated on the relationship existing between the parties at the relevant time. Dumanski v. City of Erie, 348 Pa. 505, 507, 34 A.2d 508, 509 (1943). Murphy cannot satisfy the first element of this time-honored requirement for a tort claim.
Duquesne owed no duty to Murphy. “Our Courts have been reluctant to impose a general duty of care upon government employees to specific persons where the alleged duty is simply the protection of the public at large — ie., society — from third-party criminal acts.” Moore v. Commonwealth, Department of Justice, 114 Pa.Cmwlth. 56, 538 A.2d 111, 116 (1988). There is generally “no duty resting on a municipality or other governmental body to provide police protection to any particular person.” Melendez v. City of Philadelphia, 320 Pa.Super. 59, 466 A.2d 1060, 1063 (1983). “[A]n individual’s injury resulting from a police officer’s failure to prevent or ameliorate a crime must be redressed through public prosecution, and not in a private suit for monetary damages.” Morris v. Musser, 84 Pa.Cmwlth. 170, 478 A.2d 937, 939 (1984) (citation omitted).7
In any case, Murphy’s claim that Du-quesne failed to investigate the robbery and shooting are refuted by Murphy’s own admissions. The robbery suspect was arrested within days of the robbery; the *680stolen items were returned to Murphy; and, at the time of Murphy’s deposition, the convicted thief was still incarcerated. In addition, Murphy agreed in his deposition that the police investigation determined that the bullet that went through Murphy’s window was the result of a shooting by an unknown individual trying to shoot a person on the street but, instead, hitting Murphy’s window. The investigation was not successful in determining the shooter’s identity. As such, there was no one to arrest and prosecute.
Murphy’s final issue is that the trial court abused its discretion by dismissing his suit. He offers no legal authority or even argument in support of this contention. The dismissal of Murphy’s suit by the trial court was proper where, as here, a baseless suit was presented. Indeed, it was appropriate to “prejudice” Murphy in this regard; he had no right to pursue this frivolous action.
Legal impediments older and more fundamental than the Tort Claims Act stand in the way of Murphy’s action against Du-quesne. It is well settled that a crime is an offense against the sovereign. It injures not just the victim but the public at large and is punished by way of a judicial proceeding in the Commonwealth’s name. Commonwealth v. Malloy, 304 Pa.Super. 297, 450 A.2d 689, 691 (1982). Prosecutions do not settle private grievances but, rather, rectify the injury done to the Commonwealth. The only recourse of one, such as Murphy, who has been the victim of the crime is to pursue the perpetrator, not Duquesne, in a civil action. In no case does a victim’s recourse extend to compelling the Commonwealth to prosecute, or even investigate a crime. See Hutchinson v. Merchants’ and Mechanics’ Bank of Wheeling, 41 Pa. 42 (1861) (explaining the difference between a private lawsuit and public prosecution). It is for the criminal prosecutor, not the private citizen, to control enforcement of our criminal statutes. Malloy, 450 A.2d at 691-692.
The trial court’s grant of summary judgment is affirmed.
ORDER
AND NOW, this 5th day of May, 2006, the order of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County dated June 9, 2005, in the above captioned matter is hereby affirmed.

. 42 Pa.C.S. §§ 8541-8542.


. Murphy never made any filing with the trial court to explain his failure to appear at the argument nor did he request reconsideration.


. On July 11, 2005, Murphy filed a notice of appeal to the Superior Court from the trial court's June 9, 2005, order. On July 13, 2005, the Superior Court returned Murphy's notice of appeal since he had failed to indicate that the notice had been served on the trial judge and the court reporter. On July 29, 2005, Plaintiff filed an amended certificate of service and his appeal was returned to the Superior Court. On September 22, 2005, the Superior Court issued an order transferring Murphy’s appeal to the Commonwealth Court pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 762.


. Our scope of review of a trial court's order granting or denying summary judgment is de novo. Summary judgment is only appropriate when, after examining the record in the light most favorable to the non-moving parly, there is no genuine issue of material fact, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Green Valley Dry Cleaners, Inc. v. Westmoreland County Industrial Development Corporation, 832 A.2d 1143, 1150 n. 5 (Pa.Cmwlth.2003).


.It states in relevant part:
(e) In an action seeking monetary relief for bodily injury, death or property damage, averments in a pleading to which a responsive pleading is required may be denied generally except the following averments of fact which must be denied specifically:
(1) averments relating to the identity of the person by whom a material act was committed, the agency or employment of such person and the ownership, possession or control of the property or instrumentality involved;
(2) if a pleading seeks additional relief, aver-ments in support of such other relief; and
(3) averments in preliminary objections.
Pa. R.C.P. 1029(e) (emphasis added).


. Section 8542(a) of the Tort Claims Act provides:
(a) Liability imposed. — A local agency shall be liable for damages on account of an injury to a person or property within the limits set forth in this subchapter if both of the following conditions are satisfied and the injury occurs as a result of one of the acts set forth in subsection (b):
(1) The damages would be recoverable under common law or a statute creating a cause of action if the injury were caused by a person not having available a defense under section 8541 (relating to governmental immunity generally) or section 8546 (relating to defense of official immunity); and
(2) The injury was caused by the negligent acts of the local agency or an employee thereof acting within the scope of his office or duties with respect to one of the categories listed in subsection (b). As used in this paragraph, “negligent acts” shall not include acts or conduct which constitutes a crime, actual fraud, actual malice or willful misconduct.
42 Pa.C.S. § 8542(a).


. A very narrow exception to this rule exists if there is a special relationship between the police and the crime victim; for example, a special duty arises when the police expressly promise to protect specific individuals from precise harm. Morris, 478 A.2d at 940. Murphy does not raise the special exception. Further, the facts pled in the complaint do not allege that the Duquesne police department offered him special protection as a witness or otherwise.

2460763,2460763,2274436,State v. Dillon,"State of Kansas, Appellee, v. William D. Dillon, Appellant","

  Leben, J.:
 

  We revisit this case on remand from the Kansas Supreme Court. Previously, we had vacated the district court’s sentence of Wilham Dillon based on our conclusion that the district court explicitly refused to consider the arguments upon which Dillon sought a departure sentence.
  
   State v. Dillon,
  
  44 Kan. App. 2d 1138, 244 P.3d 680 (2010). A majority of this panel concluded that the district court’s refusal to consider relevant factual arguments the defendant made in support of a departure sentence violated the defendant’s due-process rights. Because of that, we concluded that an appeal could be heard despite the normal rule that a defendant may not appeal a departure sentence.
 

  The Kansas Supreme Court summarily reversed our decision and remanded for further consideration in light of
  
   State v. Huerta,
  
  291 Kan. 831, 247 P.3d 1043 (2011). Having considered supplemental briefs from the parties and
  
   Huerta,
  
  we now dismiss Dillon’s appeal for lack of jurisdiction.
 

  As all parties recognize, the district court gave Dillon a presumptive sentence: sentencing guidelines called for a prison sentence, not probation, and the court gave Dillon a sentence within the range called for by the guidelines. And the legislature has pro
   
   *1076
   
  vided in K.S.A. 21-4721(c)(1) that an “appellate court shall not review . . . [a]ny sentence that is within the presumptive sentence for the crime.” This restriction is important because the right to appeal in Kansas is limited to what is provided by statute; Kansas courts have not recognized any constitutional right to an appeal.
  
   State v. Gill,
  
  287 Kan. 289, 293-94, 196 P.3d 369 (2008).
 

  Before
  
   Huerta,
  
  the panel majority had understood that there was a limited exception when the district court denied due process to the defendant at sentencing. But in the
  
   Huerta
  
  decision, rendered 4 months after our first decision in Dillon’s case, our Supreme Court said that we had overextended the cases suggesting exceptions. 291 Kan. at 839-40. The
  
   Huerta
  
  court also set out a clear rule for us to apply: “A criminal defendant’s allegation of constitutional infirmity in an individual presumptive sentence does not make the sentence amenable to direct appeal under K.S.A. 21-4721(c)(1).” 291 Kan. 831, Syl. ¶ 3.
 

  Dillon’s case fits squarely within that rule. He argues that his own presumptive sentence violated his constitutional due-process right to have the district court consider the legally relevant arguments he made. We do not have jurisdiction to consider his appeal under
  
   Huerta.
  


  In his supplemental
  
   post-Huerta
  
  brief, Dillon tries to recharacterize his appeal as a motion to correct illegal sentence. But he had not previously raised this argument, and our Supreme Court has also said that “a defendant may not file a motion to correct an illegal sentence based on constitutional challenges to his or her sentence.”
  
   State v. Mitchell,
  
  284 Kan. 374, 377, 162 P.3d 18 (2007).
 

  Dillon’s appeal is therefore dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.

2432413,2432413,2304901,Goodwin v. Goodwin,"James W. GOODWIN Et Al., Petitioners, v. Betty M. GOODWIN, Respondent","

  PER CURIAM.
 

  This appeal by James W. Goodwin and others is from an order of the district court directing the issuance of a writ of temporary injunction. The court of civil appeals affirmed the judgment. 451 S.W. 2d 532.
 

  Plaintiff, Betty M. Goodwin, instituted this suit for injunction against the defendants, James W. Goodwin and others, to enjoin them from removing certain property pendente lite. The injunction was issued by the trial court, but in its order granting the writ the court did not fix the amount of security to be given by the applicant, as is required by Rule 684, Tex.R.Civ.P., and prior to the issuance of the injunction the applicant did not execute and file with the clerk a bond to the defendants, which is also required by Rule 684.
 

  An appeal from the judgment of the district court was seasonably perfected by the defendants, but in the interim period between the filing of briefs and oral argument before the court of civil appeals, the plaintiff submitted a motion to the trial court to “Set Bond” on the injunction that it had previously issued in her favor. Following notice and a hearing with both adversaries present, the district court amended its original order by fixing the amount of security to be given by the applicant, who immediately complied with the amended order, and filed a bond in the amount therein fixed.
 

  Subsequently, in their argument before the court of civil appeals, the defendants contended that the applicant’s failure to file a bond prior to the original issuance of the temporary injunction rendered it void. The court of civil appeals, relying upon Carleton v. Dierks, 195 S.W.2d 834 (Tex.Civ.App.-Austin 1946, no writ), held that the failure of the trial court to fix the amount of security and to require the applicant to file a bond to the defendant in that sum, did not make the original order granting the injunction void, but voidable only. This decision of the court of civil appeals is in conflict with the opinion in Lancaster v. Lancaster, 155 Tex. 528, 291 S.W.2d 303 (1956), a previous opinion of this Court, wherein we held that under Rule 684 a bond is specifically required as a condition precedent to the issuance of a temporary injunction, and the failure of the applicant to file such a bond renders the injunction void
  
   cab initio.
  
  In accordance therewith, we reverse the judgment of the court of civil appeals under Rule 483, Tex.R.Civ.P., without granting James Goodwin’s writ of error and hearing the
   
   *886
   
  case, and we reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the cause to the trial court. However, we are not to be understood as holding the injunction, as issued under the amended order, is invalidated or void.
 

  Defendants also argue that the perfection of their appeal to the court of civil appeals vested jurisdiction over the subject matter solely in that court, thereby divesting the trial court of any power to subsequently amend its original order. In answering this argument the court of civil appeals seems to have approved the holding in Carleton v. Dierks, supra, that a court of civil appeals is authorized by Rule 434, Tex.R.Civ.P. to require trial courts to amend injunction judgments so as to include provisions therein for the applicant’s bond, and to proceed thereafter as though there has been no omission of such provisions. This observation by the court of civil appeals was unnecessary to its decision, and we reserve the question.

7472454,7547057,64548085,Fontenot v. Fontenot,Richard Lee FONTENOT v. Georgia Ann FONTENOT,"
ELLIS, Judge.
This is a suit for divorce on the ground of adultery, filed by Richard Lee Fontenot against Georgia Ann Fontenot. Plaintiff is also seeking custody of his two minor children, Laura Ann and Tammy Marie, aged two and one half years and three months, respectively. A custody rule was filed and tried, and it was agreed, according to the record and the minute entries, that judgment could be rendered on the merits on the basis of the testimony taken at the trial of the rule.
After trial, and pursuant to the stipulation, judgment was rendered in favor of plaintiff awarding him a divorce and custody of the children. From that judgment, defendant has appealed.
The parties were married on May 28, 1971, and separated finally on about July 10, 1974. The two children stayed with Mrs. Fontenot when plaintiff moved out. Without going into the details of the testimony, we think the preponderance of the evidence is to the effect that one Ronnie Howell lived in the apartment with Mrs. Fontenot for about three weeks to a month. He slept in the bed with Mrs. Fon-tenot. Laura slept on a mattress on the floor in the living room and Tammy slept in a crib. Mrs. Fontenot’s brother, Brad, lived in the apartment for about two weeks during this time and slept on a couch in the living room.
There is evidence that Mrs. Fontenot smoked marijuana in the presence of the children, that she once shoplifted, and that she often frequented bars until the early hours of the morning.
Tammy suffered from cradle cap, diaper rash and an eye infection, none of which cleared up while the children were in Mrs. Fontenot’s care. The children were often not fed a properly balanced diet.
Shortly before this suit was filed in November, 1974, plaintiff took the children to his mother’s home, where they were living at the time of the trial. Plaintiff is an automobile mechanic with a history of mental illness which took place some one and one half to two years before the trial. He plans to keep the children in his mother’s home, with the assistance of his mother and his sister, who lives fifteen miles from his mother’s home.
Defendant denied any misconduct with Ronnie Howell, and stated that she took good care of her children. She planned to live with her mother, if she got custody of the children. She also denied most of the charges levied against her character.
The trial judge apparently felt that the best interest of the children required that their custody be granted to their father, and that the evidence warranted the granting of a divorce on the grounds of adultery. After a careful consideration of the record, we find no manifest error in his conclusion.
The judgment appealed from is therefore affirmed, at defendant’s cost.
Affirmed.

2543008,2543008,2089676,Castillo v. Koppes-Conway,"Oscar CASTILLO, Plaintiff-Appellant, v. Rebecca KOPPES-CONWAY, Defendant-Appellee","

  Opinion by
 

  Judge RUSSEL.
 

  Plaintiff, Oscar Castillo, appeals the trial court’s order granting summary judgment for defendant, Rebecca Koppes-Conway. We affirm and remand with directions.
 

  I.
 

  Plaintiff hired defendant to represent him in a workers’ compensation case. The fee agreement provided, among other things, that if plaintiff fired defendant before the case was resolved, he would pay her for work that she had performed.
 

  Plaintiff later fired defendant and hired his present attorney. Defendant filed an attorney’s lien, alleging that plaintiff had failed to pay her under the fee agreement.
 

  Plaintiff then sued defendant. He asserted numerous claims, including breach of contract and professional duties, abuse of process, violation of the Colorado Consumer Protection Act, conversion, fraud, slander against title, and violation of federal and state racketeering laws. He brought these claims on his own behalf and purportedly on behalf of others similarly situated. Defendant answered, denying plaintiffs allegations and asserting various defenses, including the statute of limitations and failure to state a claim.
 

  Defendant later moved for summary judgment. In response, plaintiff filed a document entitled “Corrected Verified Motion for Entry of Default or Default Judgment, for Extension of Time, or for Other ReliefTte-sponse to Defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment.” The court ruled that plaintiffs submission was improper because it did not, by affidavit or otherwise, set forth specific facts to demonstrate a triable issue. The court ordered plaintiff to submit a proper response:
 

  Due to the voluminous and duplicative nature of the issues addressed by Plaintiff, the Court is unable to decipher whether Plaintiff has met the above legal standard to the extent necessary to survive a motion for summary judgment. At this time, it appears likely that Plaintiff has not met [his] burden. However, the Court will indulge Plaintiff with an additional twenty days in which to file a response to Defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment. Plaintiff is ORDERED to address
  
   only
  
  the issues raised in Defendant’s motion. Any and all other requests for relief shall be individually asserted through separate written motions.
 

  Plaintiff filed three additional documents. The court determined that none of them complied with its order and granted sum
   
   *291
   
  mary judgment for defendant. The court ruled that defendant had “shown specific facts probative of [her] right to judgment” and that plaintiff had failed to “set forth specific facts to demonstrate the existence of a triable issue.”
 

  Plaintiff then filed a motion for new trial. The court ordered this submission stricken because it was “replete with language that is disparaging and extremely disrespectful to opposing counsel and to the Court.”
 

  II.
 

  Plaintiff now appeals the order granting summary judgment. Defendant counters that summary judgment must be affirmed because plaintiff has failed to present a cogent assertion of error. We agree with defendant.
 

  Plaintiffs opening brief purports to “incorporate by reference” over two hundred pages of pleadings that plaintiff filed in the trial court. This technique is improper because it attempts to shift — from the litigants to the appellate court — the task of locating and synthesizing the relevant facts and arguments.

  181 F.3d 865, 867 (7th Cir.1999) (“A brief must make all arguments accessible to the judges, rather than ask them to play archaeologist with the record.”). It also “makes a mockery” of the rules that govern the length of briefs.

  377 F.3d 1164, 1167 n. 4 (11th Cir.2004).
 

  As the Colorado Supreme Court has stated:
 

  Our Court will not search through briefs to discover what errors are relied on, and then search through the record for supporting evidence. It is the task of counsel to inform us, as required by our rules, both as to the specific errors relied on and the grounds and supporting facts and authorities therefor.
 


   Mauldin v. Lowery,
  
  127 Colo. 234, 236, 255 P.2d 976, 977 (1953).
 

  Plaintiffs opening brief does not advance an identifiable assertion of error. Instead of setting forth a cogent argument, plaintiff presents tortured rhetoric:
 

  [This ease] is the stuff of which Turow best sellers and other works of “legal fiction” are made, and by which no jurist, either de jure or de facto, would wish to be remembered, but as to which the current chapter is about to be written by the august members of this select Panel — albeit in a strangely oxymoronic, yet altogether predictable, “unpublished” fashion, the very nature of which may yet cast grave doubt upon the continued vitality or viability of C.A.R. 35(f)
  
   viz-cu-wiz,
  
  such extraordinary ease or circumstances.

  Like Dred Scott two centuries earlier, [plaintiff] and his previously described “ignominious” masses of Mexicano victims of [defendant’s] pattern of theft, fraud, and conversion perpetrated within the course and scope of her capacity as their sole legal counsel, have yet to gain the recognition by the courts of Colorado of their status even as “persons” imbued with those rights, privileges, and immunities endemic to others of their species seeking some form of relief from these same courts.
 

  Plaintiffs brief cites only one rule of procedure, C.A.R. 35(f), and only two cases:
  
   Plessy v. Ferguson,
  
  163 U.S. 537, 16 S.Ct. 1138, 41 L.Ed. 256 (1896), and
  
   Dred Scott v. Sandford,
  
  60 U.S. (19 How.) 393, 15 L.Ed. 691 (1856). None of these authorities is relevant to the trial court’s ruling.
 

  For these reasons, plaintiffs brief violates C.A.R. 28(a)(4), which requires the brief to set forth “the contentions of the appellant with respect to the issues presented, and the reasons therefor, with citations to the authorities, statutes, and parts of the record relied on.” It also violates C.A.R. 28(g), which imposes limitations on the lengths of briefs. In light of these failures and violations, we will not review the trial court’s order.
  
   See Mauldin v. Lowery, supra; In re Estate of Hays,
  
  127 Colo. 411, 257 P.2d 972 (1953) (writ of error dismissed where briefs were insufficient to advise the court of issues presented or merits thereof);
  
   Middlemist v.

   BDO Seidman, LLP,
  
  958 P.2d 486, 495 (Colo.App.1997) (declining to address propriety of trial court’s orders where plaintiff failed to identify specific errors and to provide legal authority);
  
   Biel v. Alcott,
  
  876 P.2d 60, 64 (Colo.App.1993) (affirming order of dismissal where appealing party failed to provide authority to support its contentions of error).
 

  III.
 

  Defendant requests attorney fees and costs under C.A.R. 38(d). We grant this request and, acting on our own motion, also award attorney fees under § 13-17-102, C.R.S.2005.
 

  Section 13-17-102(2), C.R.S.2005, states:
 

  [I]n any civil action of any nature commenced or appealed in any court of record in this state, the court shall award, by way of judgment or separate order, reasonable attorney fees against any attorney or party who has brought or defended a civil action, either in whole or in part, that the court determines lacks substantial justification.
 

  Under § 13-17-102(4), C.R.S.2005, a court may assess attorney fees on its own motion if it finds that an attorney or party has brought an action that lacks “substantial justification.” An action lacks substantial justification if it is “substantially frivolous, substantially groundless, or substantially vexatious.” Section 13-17-102(4).
 

  Appeals may be deemed frivolous in two distinct ways:
 

  First, where an appeal is taken in a case in which “the judgment by the tribunal below was so plainly correct and the legal authority contrary to appellant’s position so clear that there is really no appealable issue,” the appeal is held to be
  
   “frivolous as filed.”
  
  Second, even in cases in which genuinely appealable issues may exist, so that the taking of an appeal is not frivolous, the appellant’s misconduct in arguing the appeal may be such as to justify holding the appeal to be
  
   “frivolous as argued.”
  



   Dungaree Realty, Inc. v. United States,
  
  30 F.3d 122, 124 (Fed.Cir.1994) (quoting
  
   Romala Corp. v. United States,
  
  927 F.2d 1219, 1222 (Fed.Cir.1991)) (emphasis added; citation omitted).
 

  Here, we cannot conclude that plaintiffs appeal is frivolous as filed. We do not know whether there is a “rational argument based on the evidence or law” buried somewhere in the record; nor do we know whether “the appeal is prosecuted for the sole purpose of harassment or delay.”
  
   Mission Denver Co. v. Pierson,
  
  674 P.2d 363, 366 (Colo.1984).
 

  Nevertheless, we conclude that this appeal is frivolous as argued.
 

  In enacting § 13-17-102(4), the general assembly recognized that courts “have become increasingly burdened with litigation which is straining the judicial system and interfering with the effective administration of civil justice.” Section 13-17-101, C.R.S.2005. The general assembly instructed us to “liberally construe the provisions of this article to effectuate substantial justice and comply with the intent set forth in this section.” Section 13-17-101.
 

  We are “mindful of the possibility that awarding damages and costs could have an undue chilling effect on the behavior of later litigants.”
  
   Finch v. Hughes Aircraft Co.,
  
  926 F.2d 1574, 1578 (Fed.Cir.1991). But we also must consider the interests of parties who are forced to defend against frivolous appeals and parties whose cases await our attention. “Sanctions under Rule 38 thus perform two vital functions: They compensate the prevailing party for the expense of having to defend a wholly meritless appeal, and by deterring frivolity, they preserve the appellate calendar for cases truly worthy of consideration.”
  
   Finch v. Hughes Aircraft Co., supra,
  
  926 F.2d at 1578 (considering Fed.R.App. 38, which is comparable to C.A.R. 38(d)).
 

  We hold that an appeal “lacks substantial justification” and is “substantially frivolous” under § 13-17-102(4) when the appellant’s briefs fail to set forth, in a manner consistent with C.A.R. 28, a coherent assertion of error, supported by legal authority. Thus, for the reasons previously stated, we adjudge that plaintiffs appeal lacks substantial justification. The appeal has burdened the judicial system and interfered with the effective administration of justice. Although
   
   *293
   
  plaintiff had an opportunity to respond to defendant’s request for sanctions, he has not justified his conduct.
  
   See Mission Denver Co. v. Pierson, supra,
  
  674 P.2d at 366 (if appellee requests sanctions in the answer brief, appellant has notice and an opportunity to respond).
 

  We therefore conclude that an award of attorney fees and costs incurred on appeal is warranted under C.A.R. 38(d) and § 13-17-102(2).
  
   See Marriage of Purcell,
  
  879 P.2d 468, 469 (Colo.App.1994) (awarding attorney fees under C.A.R. 38(d) as a sanction for a frivolous appeal);
  
   State Indus., Inc. v. Mor-Flo Indus., Inc.,
  
  948 F.2d 1573, 1581 & n. 10 (Fed.Cir.1991) (noting unanimity of decisions that attorney fees may be awarded as “just damages” under Fed.R.App. P. 38);
  
   see also Refac Int’l, Ltd. v. Hitachi, Ltd.,
  
  921 F.2d 1247 (Fed.Cir.1990) (sanctions imposed under Fed.R.App. P. 38 for failure to present clear or cogent arguments);
  
   Olympia Co. v. Celotex Corp.,
  
  771 F.2d 888 (5th Cir.1985) (sanctions imposed under Fed. R.App. P. 38 for rambling briefs that made no attempt to address elements required to obtain reversal).
 

  We further conclude that the award of fees and costs should be imposed against plaintiffs attorney, and not against plaintiff.
 

  Under § 13-17-102(3), C.R.S.2005, a court may allocate the payment of attorney fees among “the offending attorneys and parties, jointly or severally, as it deems most just, and may charge such amount, or portion thereof, to any offending attorney or party.” This section allows an award exclusively against an attorney who bears sole responsibility for the offending conduct.
  
   Parker v. Davis,
  
  888 P.2d 324, 326 (Colo.App.1994);
  
   Anderson Boneless Beef, Inc. v. Sunshine Health Care Ctr., Inc.,
  
  878 P.2d 98, 101 (Colo.App.1994).
 

  Where, as here, an appeal is frivolous for reasons that lie solely within the control of counsel, an appellate court may direct that an award of fees and costs be paid by counsel alone.
  
   See Macklin v. City of New Orleans,
  
  300 F.3d 552, 554 (5th Cir.2002) (requiring attorney to pay award under Fed. R.App. P. 38 “because the quality of the research and briefing is within the province of the attorney”);
  
   Herzfeld & Stem v. Blair,
  
  769 F.2d 645, 647 (10th Cir.1985) (award of fees imposed on attorney who was “responsible for this case and its presentation”).
 

  Therefore, we direct the trial court on remand to (1) determine the amount of reasonable attorney fees and costs incurred by defendant on appeal under C.A.R. 38(d) and § 1317103, C.R.S.2005, and (2) assess that amount against plaintiffs attorney alone.
 

  The judgment is affirmed. The case is remanded for an award of attorney fees and costs incurred on appeal to be assessed against attorney Richard K. Blundell.
 

  Judge WEBB and Judge HAWTHORNE concur.

3762919,4008229,3880371,"Lakes v. Mayo, Unpublished Decision (11-20-2006)",Linda Lakes v. Shelby D. Mayo," OPINION
{¶ 1} Plaintiff-appellant, Linda Lakes, appeals the decision of the Brown County Municipal Court in favor of defendants-appellees, Shelby and Yong Suk Mayo.1 For the reasons that follow, we reverse the municipal court's decision.
 {¶ 2} In October 2004, Lakes entered into a land contract with the Mayos to sell them an apartment building in Ripley, Ohio. The Mayos paid $5,000 when they signed the contract, with monthly payments due thereafter. In April 2005, Lakes served the Mayos with a ""Notice of Forfeiture of Land Installment Contract,"" asserting that the Mayos had violated several provisions of the contract. Specifically, Lakes alleged that the Mayos did not provide flood, fire, and extended liability insurance as required by the contract, and that they made ""structural changes"" to the property in violation of the contract. The notice stated that the land contract would be forfeited if the Mayos did not meet certain terms and conditions within 10 days. Approximately one month later, Lakes filed a complaint for forfeiture against the Mayos in the municipal court, asserting that the Mayos had materially breached the land contract.
 {¶ 3} After a bench trial in October 2005, the municipal court issued a decision denying relief to Lakes. Lakes now appeals, assigning one error as follows:
 {¶ 4} ""THE TRIAL COURT'S FINDING THAT THE DEFENDANTS-APPELLEE[S] DID NOT MATERIALLY BREACH THE LAND INSTALLMENT CONTRACT BETWEEN THE PARTIES WAS AGAINST THE MANIFEST WEIGHT OF THE EVIDENCE.""
 {¶ 5} In her sole assignment of error, Lakes argues that the municipal court's decision finding no material breach by the Mayos was against the manifest weight of the evidence. First, Lakes argues that the Mayos materially breached the provision requiring them to provide flood, fire, and extended liability insurance. Second, Lakes argues that the Mayos materially breached the provision forbidding ""structural changes"" to the property without Lakes' consent.
 {¶ 6} We will not reverse a judgment as being against the manifest weight of the evidence where the judgment is supported by some competent, credible evidence going to all essential elements of the case. Henson v. K. Collins Plumbing, Inc.,
Clermont App. No. CA2005-07-069, 2006-Ohio-3090, ¶ 46, citingC.E. Morris Co. v. Foley Constr. Co. (1978), 54 Ohio St .2d 279, syllabus. In determining whether a judgment is against the manifest weight of the evidence, a court of appeals must be guided by a presumption that the findings of the trier of fact were indeed correct. Choate v. Tranet, Inc., Warren App. No. CA2005-09-105, 2006-Ohio-4565, ¶ 68, citing Seasons Coal Co. v.Cleveland (1984), 10 Ohio St.3d 77, 79-80.
 {¶ 7} A breach of contract is a failure without legal excuse to perform any promise that forms a whole or part of a contract.Economy Linen  Towel Service, Inc. v. McIntosh (Sept. 17, 2001), Butler App. No. CA2000-11-226, 2001 WL 1081376, *2. A party is relieved of its obligations under a contract only if the breach is material. Software Clearing House, Inc. v. Intrak,Inc. (1990), 66 Ohio App.3d 163, 170. A breach is material if performance or nonperformance of the disputed term is essential to the purpose of the agreement. Bd. of Commrs. of ClermontCty., Ohio v. Village of Batavia (Feb. 26, 2001), Clermont App. No. CA2000-06-039, 2001 WL 185464, *3. Mere nominal, trifling, or technical departures will not result in a breach of contract.Tucker v. Young, Highland App. No. 04-CA-10, 2006-Ohio-1126, ¶ 25.
 {¶ 8} We first address Lakes' argument regarding the Mayos' alleged structural change to the property. The contract provides as follows: ""Vendee shall not make any structural changes to the property without the written consent of Vendor.""
 {¶ 9} The record shows that the Mayos created an interior doorway to the apartment building by cutting into a wall. It is undisputed that the Mayos did not have the consent of Lakes to create the doorway. According to the Mayos, the doorway made the property more marketable to renters.
 {¶ 10} The contract does not define ""structural."" Webster's Third New International Dictionary provides two relevant definitions of ""structural."" Definition ""1a"" provides as follows: ""of or relating to structure or a structure; affecting structure; used in building structures; constructional[.]"" Webster's Third New International Dictionary (1993), 2266. Definition ""1b"" provides as follows: ""of or relating to the load-bearing members or scheme of a building as opposed to the screening or ornamental elements[.]"" Id. Definition ""1b"" gives the following examples of structural elements: ""floor joists, rafters, wall and partition studs, supporting columns . . . foundations[.]"" Id.
 {¶ 11} According to the municipal court, Lakes failed to prove that the creation of the doorway was a ""structural"" change. The court apparently interpreted ""structural"" consistent with definition ""1b"" above. We find no error in that interpretation. Definition ""1a"" is extremely broad, and likely does not reflect what the parties intended. Applying the ""1b"" definition, the record supports the municipal court's decision that the Mayos did not materially breach the contract's provision regarding ""structural changes."" In his testimony, Shelby Mayo described the wall he altered as a ""partition wall."" Lakes, the only other witness to testify, did not testify that the wall was a load-bearing wall, or was otherwise ""structural"" within the meaning of definition ""1b."" Accordingly, we reject appellant's argument regarding the Mayos' alleged structural change.
 {¶ 12} We now address Lakes' arguments regarding the contract's insurance provision, which provides as follows:
 {¶ 13} ""Vendee shall provide and maintain flood, fire and extended liability insurance coverage for the improvements on the property, in an amount not less than the purchase price balance, in companies satisfactory to the Vendor, with loss payable to Vendor and Vendee, as their interests appear. The policy shall be delivered to and held by the Vendor.""
 {¶ 14} Lakes argues that the Mayos materially breached the above provision in three ways. She argues (1) that the Mayos failed to obtain the required insurance and deliver the policy to her; (2) that the Mayos failed to obtain insurance from a company satisfactory to her; and (3) that the Mayos failed to obtain an insurance policy including her as a loss payee.
 {¶ 15} We disagree with Lakes' first argument regarding the insurance provision. The record shows that while the Mayos did not initially procure the required insurance, they did obtain an insurance policy effective December 4, 2004, well before the date on which Lakes served the ""Notice of Forfeiture."" The record further shows that Lakes received the policy in March 2005 from her attorney, who had received it from the Mayos. Accordingly, while there was some delay, the Mayos complied with the contract's insurance provision with respect to obtaining insurance and delivering the policy to Lakes. We find no error by the municipal court in determining that the Mayos did not materially breach the contract in that regard.
 {¶ 16} We also disagree with Lakes' second argument regarding the insurance provision. According to Lakes' testimony, her attorney informed her that the policy obtained by the Mayos was satisfactory. However, when Lakes reviewed the policy herself, she concluded that certain aspects of the policy were not satisfactory. Nevertheless, the record does not indicate that Lakes found the particular company used by the Mayos to be unsatisfactory, or that she complained of a lack of opportunity to investigate the company. Rather, Lakes' testimony indicates that her objections pertained to the substance of the policy. Accordingly, the record supports the municipal court's determination that the Mayos did not materially breach the contract's provision requiring them to obtain insurance ""in companies satisfactory to the Vendor.""
 {¶ 17} We find merit in Lakes' third argument regarding the contract's insurance provision. The record shows that the insurance policy obtained by the Mayos did not name Lakes as a loss payee as required by the contract, but only named the Mayos. It is this court's opinion that insuring Lakes' real property against loss was essential to the purpose of the contract. Had Lakes known that the Mayos would not obtain a policy providing protection specifically to her, she very likely would not have entered into the land contract. After reviewing the record, we find that the Mayos' failure to obtain a policy naming Lakes as a loss payee constituted a material breach of the contract. The municipal court's decision to the contrary is not supported by the record.
 {¶ 18} Because the record shows that the Mayos materially breached the land contract by not providing a policy of insurance naming Lakes as a loss payee, we sustain Lakes' sole assignment of error. We reverse the municipal court's decision dismissing Lakes' forfeiture complaint and remand this case for further proceedings according to law and consistent with this opinion.

6028487,6162780,62522940,Stuart LL. v. Aimee KK.,In the Matter of Stuart LL. v. Aimee KK.,"
OPINION OF THE COURT
Lahtinen, J.P.
The contentious breakup of the parties’ relationship resulted in Family Court ordering each party, in September 2012, to, among other things, refrain from any communication with the other party for two years. Respondent thereafter attempted on several occasions to call petitioner at his various phone numbers. This proceeding ensued and, at the hearing, proof included documentation and a witness from the phone company establishing calls made during the time the protective order was in effect from respondent’s phone to petitioner’s phones. Family Court further found credible relevant proof presented by petitioner and a lack of credibility as to respondent’s pertinent proof. Family Court determined that clear and convincing evidence established that respondent had willfully violated the order of protection and, among other things, ordered a mental health evaluation and sentenced her to 75 days in jail. She had reportedly served 11 days of her sentence when we granted a stay pending this appeal.*
Respondent challenges neither Family Court’s determination that she violated the September 2012 order nor that part of the court’s disposition that did not involve incarceration. However, she argues that the aspect of the disposition that sentenced her to a definite term of incarceration as a punitive remedy was error since Family Court did not make its finding of willfulness by the standard of beyond a reasonable doubt. Case law has not been consistent regarding the level of proof when considering an alleged willful violation of a protective order (see e.g. Matter *220of Rubackin v Rubackin, 62 AD3d 11, 20-21 [2009] [discussing standards employed in various cases]). This inconsistency may be due in part to the statutory silence as to the quantum of proof (see Family Ct Act § 846-a [stating that the court must be satisfied by “competent proof”]), as well as the fact that, like other statutes implicating contempt, a Family Ct Act article 8 proceeding can involve civil contempt, criminal contempt or both (see McCain v Dinkins, 84 NY2d 216, 226 [1994]; Matter of McCormick v Axelrod, 59 NY2d 574, 582-583 [1983]; Matter of Rubackin v Rubackin, 62 AD3d at 21). Criminal and civil contempt have different levels of proof as “criminal contempt must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt,” whereas “civil contempt. . . must be proven by clear and convincing evidence” (Town of Copake v 13 Lackawanna Props., LLC, 73 AD3d 1308, 1309 [2010]).
Where, as here, a person who has violated an order of protection is incarcerated as a punitive remedy for a definite period— with no avenue to shorten the term by acts that extinguish the contempt — then that aspect of the Family Ct Act article 8 proceeding “is one involving criminal contempt [and] [t]he standard of proof that must be met to establish that the individual willfully violated the court’s order is beyond a reasonable doubt” (Matter of Rubackin v Rubackin, 62 AD3d at 21; see Merril Sobie, Practice Commentaries, McKinney’s Cons Laws of NY, Book 29A, Family Ct Act § 846-a at 346). Our cases indicating otherwise should no longer be followed. Although Family Court did not articulate the correct standard of proof, our review of the record — including documentary evidence and testimony found credible by Family Court — reveals proof of a willful violation beyond a reasonable doubt (see Matter of Rubackin v Rubackin, 62 AD3d at 22; see also Town of Copake v 13 Lackawanna Props., LLC, 73 AD3d at 1310).
Nonetheless, under the particular circumstances of this case, we find that a sentence of time served with the remaining days of respondent’s sentence suspended is appropriate, provided that respondent complete within 30 days — if not already completed — the ordered mental health evaluation and otherwise comply with Family Court’s order (see Family Ct Act § 846-a; Matter of Barbara O., 252 AD2d 761, 762 [1998]; see also Matter of Ahituv v Ahituv, 3 AD3d 531, 531 [2004]; Matter of Thompson v Thompson, 30 AD2d 811, 811 [1968]).
Stein, McCarthy, Rose and Devine, JJ., concur.
Ordered that the order is modified, on the law, without costs, to provide that the remaining days of respondent’s sentence of *22175 days shall be suspended provided that she complete, within 30 days of the date of this Court’s decision, the ordered mental health evaluation, and, as so modified, affirmed.

 Although the notice of appeal was from the order of commitment which was entered before the underlying order of fact-finding and disposition, we exercise our discretion to treat the notice as validly from the underlying order (see CPLR 5520 [c]).
