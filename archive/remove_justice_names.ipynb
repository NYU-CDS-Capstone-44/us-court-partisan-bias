Justice Black\\n \\n\\n  delivered the opinion of the Court.\\n \\n\\n  By the Raker Act of December 19, 1913,\\n  \\n   1\\n  \\n  Congress granted the City and County of San Francisco,\\n  \\n   2\\n  \\n  subject to express conditions, certain lands and rights-of-way in the public domain in Yosemite National Park and Stanis-laus National Forest. The Act in terms declared that this, known as the “Hetch-Hetchy” grant, was intended for use by the City both in constructing and maintaining *a means of supplying water for the ■'domestic purposes of the City and other public bodies, and in establishing a system “for generation and sale and distribution of electric energy.”\\n \\n\\n  Upon application of the Secretary of the Interior, the United States brought this suit\\n  \\n   3\\n  \\n  in equity charging the City with disposing of power through the Pacific Gas\\n  \\n   &amp;\\n  \\n  Electric Company, a private utility, in violation of § 6 of the granting Act. Section 6 provides “That the grantee [the City] is prohibited from ever selling or letting to any corporation or individual, except a municipality or a municipal water district or irrigation district, the right to sell or sublet the water or the electric energy sold or given to it or him by the grantee:\\n  \\n   Provided,\\n  \\n  That the rights hereby granted shall not be sold,\\n   \\n   *19\\n   \\n  assigned, or transferred to any private person, corporation, or association, and in case of any attempt to so sell, assign, transfer, or convey, this grant shall revert to the Government of the United States.”\\n \\n\\n  The District Court concluded that the City was violating § 6 by the sale and distribution of Hetch-Hetchy power through the Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Company, a private utility. Accordingly, the City was required by injunction alternatively to discontinue such disposal of the power or cease further use of the. lands and rights granted it under the Act for generation and transmission of electric energy.\\n  \\n   4\\n  \\n  The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed,\\n  \\n   5\\n  \\n  finding that the private utility was merely acting as the City’s agent in the sale and distribution of Hetch-Hetchy power and holding that § 6 does not prohibit such sale and distribution of that power by a private utility.\\n \\n\\n  Here, as in the courts below, the City has defended the sale and distribution by Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Company of power originating at Hetch-Hetchy upon the grounds that such disposition does not violate' the prohibitions of § 6; that imposition of these prohibitions was not within the constitutional authority of Congress; and that if § 6 is valid and has been violated, the United States is not entitled to injunctive relief in equity.\\n \\n\\n\\n   First. Prohibitions of Section\\n  \\n  6. — In the City’s view, § 6 does not preclude private utilities from all participation in the ultimate sale and distribution of Hetch-Hetchy power. The City insists that the Section, so construed, does no more than prohibit the City from selling\\n   \\n   *20\\n   \\n  Hetch-Hetchy power to a private utility 'for resale to consumers and therefore permits consignment of the power to the Company, as agent of the City, for sale and distribution. On the contrary, the Government’s position rests upon the claim that Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Company is not in reality selling and distributing Hetch-Hetchy power as consignee and agent but as purchaser for resale; that the grant to the City was made upon the mandatory condition that this power be sold solely and exclusively by the City directly to consumers and without private profit in order to bring it into direct competition with adjacent privately owned utilities; and that § 6 not only withholds the right of selling for resale but also prohibits the City “from ever selling or letting” to any private corporation “the right to sell or sublet the . . . electric energy sold or given to it ... ” by the City. The language of the Act, its background and its history require the construction given § 6 by the Government.\\n \\n\\n  From its provisions,\\n  \\n   6\\n  \\n  it is apparent that the Act conditions the grant upon and contemplates the development, sale and distribution of electrical power by the City itself “for municipal and commercial use” on a scale to be gradually stepped up over a period of years. “The . . . grantee shall develop and use hydroelectric power for the use of its people and shall . . . sell or supply such power for irrigation, pumping, or other beneficial use.” The “right to sell or sublet the . . . electric energy” so generated by the City cannot, as a consequence of § 6, be sold or let. And in case of any attempt to “sell, assign, transfer, or convey [the rights granted], this grant shall revert to the Government of the United States.”\\n \\n\\n  From the statement of the Congressman responsible for the application of the prohibitions of § 6 specifically to\\n   \\n   *21\\n   \\n  electric energy,\\n  \\n   7\\n  \\n  it is clear that as enacted § 6 was understood to prohibit the City from transferring to a private utility the right to sell Hetch-Hetchy power (the Government’s contention) and not merely to forbid sale of power as a commodity for resale, as the City would have us hold:\\n \\n\\n  “Mr. Taylor of Colorado. We have got to let the municipality sell to individuals or consumers.\\n \\n\\n  “Mr. Thomson of Illinois. Yes; but not the right to sell some one else the power.\\n \\n\\n  “Mr. Taylor of Colorado. Supposing that San Francisco sells a certain block, you may say, of its power to Alameda. Has not Alameda got the right to resell that to its inhabitants?\\n \\n\\n  “Mr. Thomson of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, in answering the question of the gentleman from Colorado, I would like to call his attention to the fact that the subject of sale as printed in this section is not the power or the water, but the right to sell the power or the water.\\n \\n\\n\\n   C(\\n  \\n\\n\\n  “Mr. Raker. That [the word “individual”] really is intended to cover any person who might attempt to buy this electric power or right. I think it would cover everybody outside of a corporation, the intention being to prevent anybody getting in and getting a right and sub-letting it.”\\n  \\n   8\\n  \\n\\n\\n  In its Report on the Bill, the House Committee on Public Lands stated that the provision of § 6 “acquiesced in by the grantee, was designed to prevent any monoply or private corporation from hereafter obtaining control of the water supply of San Francisco.”\\n  \\n   9\\n  \\n\\n\\n \\n   *22\\n   \\n  From the congressional debates on the passage of the Raker Act can be read a common understanding both on the part of sponsors of the Bill and its opponents that the grant was to be so conditioned as to require municipal performance of the function of supplying Hetch-Hetchy water and electric power directly to the ultimate consumers, and to prohibit sale or distribution of that power and water by any private corporation or individual.\\n  \\n   10\\n  \\n  On the floor of the House, the following took place between the Bill’s author and other Representatives:\\n \\n\\n  “Mr. Sumners. Does San Francisco own its own lighting plant now?\\n \\n\\n  “Mr. Kahn. No; it does not.\\n \\n\\n  “Mr. Raker. I understand it does not.\\n \\n\\n  “Mr. Kahn. It does not own its own water supply. Its present water supply is furnished by a private company.\\n \\n\\n  “Mr. Raker. The Spring Valley Water System.\\n \\n\\n  “Mr. Sumners. Is it the purpose of this bill to have San Francisco supply electric power and water to its own people?\\n \\n\\n  “Mr. Raker. Yes.\\n \\n\\n  “Mr. Sumners. Or to supply these corporations, which will in turn supply the people? -\\n \\n\\n  “Mr. Raker. Under this bill it is to supply its own inhabitants first. . . .”\\n  \\n   11\\n  \\n\\n\\n  These views were in accord with the recommendation of the then Secretary of the Interior, as set out in the Report of the Public Lands Committee of the House:\\n \\n\\n \\n   *23\\n   \\n  “I think that it is very proper that the Federal Government should use whatever power it has over the public lands, over the parks, and over the forests, to compel the fullest use of these waters, and indirectly to require through its power to make conditions, the lowest possible rate for consumers.”\\n  \\n   12\\n  \\n\\n\\n  The theme — of an intent to require public utilization of Hetch-Hetchy power independently of private utilities — recurred at a later stage of the debate in the House:\\n \\n\\n  “Mr. Gray. ...\\n \\n\\n  “As I understand the bill, it provides for the furnishing of water, and also for power for commercial use. . . .\\n \\n\\n  “. . . if these works here are to be contructed to serve the baseness of commercialism, it is the vilest of all vandalism. My suggestion here to you is to strike out of this bill all the commercial profit. . . .\\n \\n\\n  “Mr. Kent [a Member of the California delegation and a supporter of the measure]. Mr. Chairman, I should like to suggest to the gentleman from Indiana [Mr. Gray] that this bill is strictly drawn in the public interest, that there is no possibility of selfish gain, and that no corporation or individual can obtain any benefit whatsoever from this bill. It is for the benefit of the people of California.”'\\n  \\n   13\\n  \\n\\n\\n  In the Senate, Senator Thomas, a member of the Committee reporting the Bill, said:\\n \\n\\n  “. . . San Francisco needs electric power, and California needs development in electric power just as much as she needs ownership in water, . . .\\n \\n\\n \\n   *24\\n   \\n  “. . . She is anxious to extend her spheres of municipal . usefulness, but she is in the grip of a power monopoly as well as that of the Spring \"Valley Co.\\n \\n\\n  “. . . This scheme appeals to me, Mr. President, so far as the power is concerned, because the city of San Francisco as a municipality will be the owner of it, the manufacturer, the distributor of it.”\\n  \\n   14\\n  \\n\\n\\n  And the words of Senator Norris, also a Member of the reporting Committee and a leading sponsor of the Bill, on the day of its final passage through the Senate, illuminate just what the Raker Act was intended to accomplish:\\n \\n\\n  “. . . I said that I was in favor of this bill to a great extent for the reason that it developed this power. This power will come into competition with the various waterpower companies of California, and there are lots of them there.\\n \\n\\n  “. . . this proposition is to harness that power and to put it to public use not to give it to a private corporation. . . .\\n \\n\\n  “Here is an instance where we are going to give it directly to the people, if we pass this bill. It is going to come into competition with power companies and corporations that have, or will have, if this bill is defeated, almost a monopoly not only in San Francisco but throughout the greater portion of California.\\n \\n\\n\\n   ((\\n  \\n\\n\\n  “These make in all, as I have counted them, 18 corporations controlling the power in the vicinity of Sain Francisco that are under the control of this one corporation. [Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Company.]\\n \\n\\n  “. . . When you sum them all up you will find that they own practically all of the hydroelectric power of the State of California, and this bill, if passed, will bring\\n   \\n   *25\\n   \\n  into competition with them one of the greatest units for the development of power that has ever been developed in the history of the world. It means competition.\\n \\n\\n  “. . . Conservation does not mean dealing out these resources to private capital for gain. It is not necessary to accuse those corporations of doing any wrong; but here will be an instance where the cheapest power on earth will be developed and where it will be sold at cost.”\\n  \\n   15\\n  \\n\\n\\n  Opponents of the Bill themselves recognized that its regulatory conditions were designed to insure distribution of power from Hetch-Hetchy through a municipal system in San Francisco. Before final passage in the Senate, opposition had practically narrowed down to the power provisions of the measure,\\n  \\n   16\\n  \\n  and these provisions contemplated a publicly owned and operated power system.\\n  \\n   17\\n  \\n \\n   *26\\n   \\n  Immediately before the vote in the Senate, Senator Mc-Cumber, opposed to the power provisions of § 6, offered a sweeping amendment which would have omitted that section and all other provisions relating to the generation, sale and distribution of Hetch-Hetchy power.\\n  \\n   18\\n  \\n  But his amendment was defeated.\\n  \\n   19\\n  \\n  And despite this articulate opposition to the policy embodied in its power features, the Act was passed.\\n \\n\\n  To limit the prohibitions of § 6 of the Act narrowly to sales of power for resale without more, as the City asks, would permit evasion and frustration of the purpose of the lawmakers. Congress clearly intended to require— as a condition of its grant — sale and distribution of Hetch-Hetchy power exclusively by San Francisco and municipal agencies directly to consumers in the belief that consumers would thus be afforded power at cheap rates in competition with private power companies, particularly Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Company. It is not the office of the courts to pass upon the justification for that belief or the efficacy of the measures chosen for putting it into effect. Selection of the emphatically expressed purpose embodied in this Act was the appropriate business of the legislative body.\\n \\n\\n \\n   *27\\n   \\n  The admitted facts shown by this record required the District Court to find — as it did — that the City was violating § 6 in permitting sale and distribution of Hetch-Hetchy power by the Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Company. Now, as it has been doing since contracting with the City in 1925, the Company sells and distributes that power as follows:\\n \\n\\n  Power generated in the City’s plant is transmitted to the Company at Newark, about thirty-five miles from San Francisco. There the power is delivered to the Company’s sub-station and thereafter is under the Company’s complete control. The Company distributes and sells this power to its customers in San Francisco and elsewhere exactly as it handles other power which it generates, buys or owns. Consumers of the power are billed by and pay the Company. The City buys Hetch-Hetchy power from the Company exactly as do other consumers. The City receives monthly payments from the Company on a fixed basis set out in the contract. The price received by the City has remained constant from 1925 to date although rates to the consumers have varied in the interim. In the event of the refusal, failure or inability of the Company to take the available output of the City’s plant in accordance with the agreement, the amount of energy which the City could have delivered is the basis of making the monthly payment, and the Company must pay for power delivered to it whether actually disposed of by resale or not. The rate paid by consumers for the Hetch-Hetchy power is not fixed by the City, as it could be under the Constitution of California,\\n  \\n   20\\n  \\n  but is fixed by the State Railroad Commission just as the price of\\n   \\n   *28\\n   \\n  all other power sold by the Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Company in California is fixed.\\n \\n\\n  Thus, in brief, the City does not itself distribute and sell the power directly to consumers; it has not provided competition with the private power company; and it has transferred the right to sell and distribute the power to a private power company in violation of the express prohibition of § 6 of the Act.\\n \\n\\n  Terminology of consignment of power, rather than of transfer by sale, and verbal description of the power Com-' pany as the City’s agent or consignee, are not sufficient to take the actions of the parties under the contract out of § 6. Congress, in effect trustee of public lands for all the people, has by this Act sought to protect and control the disposition of a section of the public domain. The City has in fact followed a course of conduct which Congress, by § 6, has forbidden. Mere words and ingenuity of contractual expression, whatever their effect between the parties, cannot by description make permissible a course of conduct forbidden by law. When we look behind the word description of the arrangement between the City and the power Company to what was actually done, we see that the City has — contrary to the terms of § 6 — abdicated its control over the sale and ultimate distribution of Hetch-Hetchy power. There remain only the determinations whether the prohibitions of § 6 are constitutional and can be enforced in equity.\\n \\n\\n\\n   Second.\\n  \\n  The prohibitions of § 6 are challenged by the City as an unconstitutional invasion of the rights of the State of California on the ground that they attempt to regulate the manner in which electricity shall be disposed of in San Francisco. And the City therefore insists that these prohibitions must be considered only as covenants in a contract between the City and the United States. Upon this premise, the City has argued here, as it did in\\n   \\n   *29\\n   \\n  the Court of Appeals, that alleged equitable defenses render the covenants unenforceable.\\n \\n\\n  When the Raker Bill was before Congress, the City filed with the Public Lands Committee of the House a brief and argument in support of the Bill. Citing authorities, including this Court’s opinions, and legislative precedents, the City submitted to Congress that as grantee it would be bound by and as grantor Congress was empowered to impose “the conditions set forth in the Hetch-Hetchy bill.”\\n  \\n   21\\n  \\n  After passage of the Bill the City accepted the grant by formal ordinance, assented to all the conditions contained in the grant, constructed the required power and water facilities, and up to date has utilized the rights, privileges and benefits granted by Congress. Now, the City seeks to retain the benefits of the Act while attacking the constitutionality of one of its important conditions.\\n  \\n   22\\n  \\n\\n\\n  Article 4, § 3, Cl. 2 of the Constitution provides that “The Congress shall have Power to dispose of and make all heedful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory and other Property belonging to the United States.” The power over the public land thus entrusted to Congress is without limitations.\\n  \\n   23\\n  \\n  “And it is not for the courts to say how that trust shall be administered. That is for Con\\n   \\n   *30\\n   \\n  gress to determine.”\\n  \\n   24\\n  \\n  Thus, Congress may constitutionally limit the disposition of the public domain to a manner consistent with its views of public policy. And the policy to govern disposal of rights to develop hydroelectric power in such public lands may, if Congress chooses, be one designed to avoid monopoly and to bring about a wide-spread distribution of benefits. The statutory requirement that Hetch-Hetchy power be publicly distributed does not represent an exercise of a general control over public policy in a State but instead only an exercise of the complete power which Congress has over particular public property entrusted to it.\\n  \\n   25\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n   Third.\\n  \\n  Finally, on the basis of numerous objections to the District Court’s judgment, assigned as errors in the court below and pressed here, the City denies the Government’s right — upon a balancing of equities — to.relief by injunction even if the present disposition of Hetch-Hetchy power be in violation of the Act.\\n \\n\\n  However, after consideration of all these objections, we are satisfied that this case does not call for a balancing of equities or for the invocation of the generalities of judicial maxims in order to determine whether an injunction should have issued. The City is availing itself of valuable rights and privileges granted by the Government and yet persists in violating the very conditions upon which those benefits were granted. Congress provided “That the grantee [City] shall at all times comply with and observe on its part all the conditions specified in this Act, and in the event that the same are not reasonably complied, with and carried out by the grantee, upon written request of the Secretary of the Interior, it is made the duty of the Attorney General in the name of the United\\n   \\n   *31\\n   \\n  States to commence all necessary suits or proceedings in the proper court having jurisdiction thereof, for the purpose of enforcing and carrying out the provisions of this Act.” Pursuant to this legislative mandate, the present suit was instituted to enforce covenants exacted from a grantee of rights in the public domain by a Congress sympathetic with the local needs of San Francisco but also jealous of its own responsibility to dispose of such rights in a manner de'emed by it most likely to render their benefits widespread. The equitable doctrines relied on do not militate against the capacity of a court of equity as a proper forum in which to make a declared policy of Congress effective. Injunction to prohibit continued use — in violation of that policy — of property granted by the United States, and to enforce the grantee’s covenants, is both appropriate and necessary.\\n  \\n   26\\n  \\n\\n\\n  A substantial part of the City’s argument rests upon its claim that the Department of the Interior in the period from 1913 to 1937 construed § 6 to forbid no more than sale of power for resale. We are asked to accept these administrative interpretations. And in addition the City suggests that conduct of the Department, of which these interpretations were a part, is sufficient to create an estoppel against the Government. Whether the Department at any time ever did more than merely to tolerate sale and distribution of Hetch-Hetchy power by the Company as a temporary expedient is doubtful. Certain it is, however, that in 1935 the Secretary of the Interior declared the City’s disposition of the power through the Company to be a violation of § 6, demanded discontinuance of this violation without success and thereafter instigated this proceeding. We cannot accept the contention that administrative rulings — such as those here\\n   \\n   *32\\n   \\n  relied on — can thwart the plain purpose of a valid law. As to estoppel, it is enough to repeat that\\n  \\n   “ . . .\\n  \\n  the United States is neither bound nor estopped by acts of its officers or agents in entering into an arrangement or agreement to do or cause to- be done what the law does not sanction or permit.”\\n  \\n   27\\n  \\n\\n\\n  The judgment of the Circuit Court is reversed.

       "      <td>*18  Justice delivered the opinion of the Court. By the Raker Act of December 19, 1913, 1 Congress granted the City and County of San Francisco, 2 subject to express conditions, certain lands and rights-of-way in the public domain in Yosemite National Park and Stanis-laus National Forest. The Act in terms declared that this, known as the “Hetch-Hetchy” grant, was intended for use by the City both in constructing and maintaining *a means of supplying water for the ■'domestic purposes of the City and other public bodies, and in establishing a system “for generation and sale and distribution of electric energy.” Upon application of the Secretary of the Interior, the United States brought this suit 3 in equity charging the City with disposing of power through the Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Company, a private utility, in violation of § 6 of the granting Act. Section 6 provides “That the grantee [the City] is prohibited from ever selling or letting to any corporation or individual, except a municipality or a municipal water district or irrigation district, the right to sell or sublet the water or the electric energy sold or given to it or him by the grantee: Provided, That the rights hereby granted shall not be sold, *19 assigned, or transferred to any private person, corporation, or association, and in case of any attempt to so sell, assign, transfer, or convey, this grant shall revert to the Government of the United States.” The District Court concluded that the City was violating § 6 by the sale and distribution of Hetch-Hetchy power through the Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Company, a private utility. Accordingly, the City was required by injunction alternatively to discontinue such disposal of the power or cease further use of the. lands and rights granted it under the Act for generation and transmission of electric energy. 4 The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, 5 finding that the private utility was merely acting as the City’s agent in the sale and distribution of Hetch-Hetchy power and holding that § 6 does not prohibit such sale and distribution of that power by a private utility. Here, as in the courts below, the City has defended the sale and distribution by Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Company of power originating at Hetch-Hetchy upon the grounds that such disposition does not violate' the prohibitions of § 6; that imposition of these prohibitions was not within the constitutional authority of Congress; and that if § 6 is valid and has been violated, the United States is not entitled to injunctive relief in equity. First. Prohibitions of Section 6. — In the City’s view, § 6 does not preclude private utilities from all participation in the ultimate sale and distribution of Hetch-Hetchy power. The City insists that the Section, so construed, does no more than prohibit the City from selling *20 Hetch-Hetchy power to a private utility 'for resale to consumers and therefore permits consignment of the power to the Company, as agent of the City, for sale and distribution. On the contrary, the Government’s position rests upon the claim that Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Company is not in reality selling and distributing Hetch-Hetchy power as consignee and agent but as purchaser for resale; that the grant to the City was made upon the mandatory condition that this power be sold solely and exclusively by the City directly to consumers and without private profit in order to bring it into direct competition with adjacent privately owned utilities; and that § 6 not only withholds the right of selling for resale but also prohibits the City “from ever selling or letting” to any private corporation “the right to sell or sublet the . . . electric energy sold or given to it ... ” by the City. The language of the Act, its background and its history require the construction given § 6 by the Government. From its provisions, 6 it is apparent that the Act conditions the grant upon and contemplates the development, sale and distribution of electrical power by the City itself “for municipal and commercial use” on a scale to be gradually stepped up over a period of years. “The . . . grantee shall develop and use hydroelectric power for the use of its people and shall . . . sell or supply such power for irrigation, pumping, or other beneficial use.” The “right to sell or sublet the . . . electric energy” so generated by the City cannot, as a consequence of § 6, be sold or let. And in case of any attempt to “sell, assign, transfer, or convey [the rights granted], this grant shall revert to the Government of the United States.” From the statement of the Congressman responsible for the application of the prohibitions of § 6 specifically to *21 electric energy, 7 it is clear that as enacted § 6 was understood to prohibit the City from transferring to a private utility the right to sell Hetch-Hetchy power (the Government’s contention) and not merely to forbid sale of power as a commodity for resale, as the City would have us hold: “Mr. Taylor of Colorado. We have got to let the municipality sell to individuals or consumers. “Mr. Thomson of Illinois. Yes; but not the right to sell some one else the power. “Mr. Taylor of Colorado. Supposing that San Francisco sells a certain block, you may say, of its power to Alameda. Has not Alameda got the right to resell that to its inhabitants? “Mr. Thomson of Illinois.  Chairman, in answering the question of the gentleman from Colorado, I would like to call his attention to the fact that the subject of sale as printed in this section is not the power or the water, but the right to sell the power or the water. C( “Mr. Raker. That [the word “individual”] really is intended to cover any person who might attempt to buy this electric power or right. I think it would cover everybody outside of a corporation, the intention being to prevent anybody getting in and getting a right and sub-letting it.” 8 In its Report on the Bill, the House Committee on Public Lands stated that the provision of § 6 “acquiesced in by the grantee, was designed to prevent any monoply or private corporation from hereafter obtaining control of the water supply of San Francisco.” 9 *22 From the congressional debates on the passage of the Raker Act can be read a common understanding both on the part of sponsors of the Bill and its opponents that the grant was to be so conditioned as to require municipal performance of the function of supplying Hetch-Hetchy water and electric power directly to the ultimate consumers, and to prohibit sale or distribution of that power and water by any private corporation or individual. 10 On the floor of the House, the following took place between the Bill’s author and other Representatives: “Mr. Sumners. Does San Francisco own its own lighting plant now? “Mr. Kahn. No; it does not. “Mr. Raker. I understand it does not. “Mr. Kahn. It does not own its own water supply. Its present water supply is furnished by a private company. “Mr. Raker. The Spring Valley Water System. “Mr. Sumners. Is it the purpose of this bill to have San Francisco supply electric power and water to its own people? “Mr. Raker. Yes. “Mr. Sumners. Or to supply these corporations, which will in turn supply the people? - “Mr. Raker. Under this bill it is to supply its own inhabitants first. . . .” 11 These views were in accord with the recommendation of the then Secretary of the Interior, as set out in the Report of the Public Lands Committee of the House: *23 “I think that it is very proper that the Federal Government should use whatever power it has over the public lands, over the parks, and over the forests, to compel the fullest use of these waters, and indirectly to require through its power to make conditions, the lowest possible rate for consumers.” 12 The theme — of an intent to require public utilization of Hetch-Hetchy power independently of private utilities — recurred at a later stage of the debate in the House: “Mr. Gray. ... “As I understand the bill, it provides for the furnishing of water, and also for power for commercial use. . . . “. . . if these works here are to be contructed to serve the baseness of commercialism, it is the vilest of all vandalism. My suggestion here to you is to strike out of this bill all the commercial profit. . . . “Mr. Kent [a Member of the California delegation and a supporter of the measure].  Chairman, I should like to suggest to the gentleman from Indiana [Mr. Gray] that this bill is strictly drawn in the public interest, that there is no possibility of selfish gain, and that no corporation or individual can obtain any benefit whatsoever from this bill. It is for the benefit of the people of California.”' 13 In the Senate, Senator Thomas, a member of the Committee reporting the Bill, said: “. . . San Francisco needs electric power, and California needs development in electric power just as much as she needs ownership in water, . . . *24 “. . . She is anxious to extend her spheres of municipal . usefulness, but she is in the grip of a power monopoly as well as that of the Spring \"Valley Co. “. . . This scheme appeals to me,  President, so far as the power is concerned, because the city of San Francisco as a municipality will be the owner of it, the manufacturer, the distributor of it.” 14 And the words of Senator Norris, also a Member of the reporting Committee and a leading sponsor of the Bill, on the day of its final passage through the Senate, illuminate just what the Raker Act was intended to accomplish: “. . . I said that I was in favor of this bill to a great extent for the reason that it developed this power. This power will come into competition with the various waterpower companies of California, and there are lots of them there. “. . . this proposition is to harness that power and to put it to public use not to give it to a private corporation. . . . “Here is an instance where we are going to give it directly to the people, if we pass this bill. It is going to come into competition with power companies and corporations that have, or will have, if this bill is defeated, almost a monopoly not only in San Francisco but throughout the greater portion of California. (( “These make in all, as I have counted them, 18 corporations controlling the power in the vicinity of Sain Francisco that are under the control of this one corporation. [Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Company.] “. . . When you sum them all up you will find that they own practically all of the hydroelectric power of the State of California, and this bill, if passed, will bring *25 into competition with them one of the greatest units for the development of power that has ever been developed in the history of the world. It means competition. “. . . Conservation does not mean dealing out these resources to private capital for gain. It is not necessary to accuse those corporations of doing any wrong; but here will be an instance where the cheapest power on earth will be developed and where it will be sold at cost.” 15 Opponents of the Bill themselves recognized that its regulatory conditions were designed to insure distribution of power from Hetch-Hetchy through a municipal system in San Francisco. Before final passage in the Senate, opposition had practically narrowed down to the power provisions of the measure, 16 and these provisions contemplated a publicly owned and operated power system. 17 *26 Immediately before the vote in the Senate, Senator Mc-Cumber, opposed to the power provisions of § 6, offered a sweeping amendment which would have omitted that section and all other provisions relating to the generation, sale and distribution of Hetch-Hetchy power. 18 But his amendment was defeated. 19 And despite this articulate opposition to the policy embodied in its power features, the Act was passed. To limit the prohibitions of § 6 of the Act narrowly to sales of power for resale without more, as the City asks, would permit evasion and frustration of the purpose of the lawmakers. Congress clearly intended to require— as a condition of its grant — sale and distribution of Hetch-Hetchy power exclusively by San Francisco and municipal agencies directly to consumers in the belief that consumers would thus be afforded power at cheap rates in competition with private power companies, particularly Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Company. It is not the office of the courts to pass upon the justification for that belief or the efficacy of the measures chosen for putting it into effect. Selection of the emphatically expressed purpose embodied in this Act was the appropriate business of the legislative body. *27 The admitted facts shown by this record required the District Court to find — as it did — that the City was violating § 6 in permitting sale and distribution of Hetch-Hetchy power by the Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Company. Now, as it has been doing since contracting with the City in 1925, the Company sells and distributes that power as follows: Power generated in the City’s plant is transmitted to the Company at Newark, about thirty-five miles from San Francisco. There the power is delivered to the Company’s sub-station and thereafter is under the Company’s complete control. The Company distributes and sells this power to its customers in San Francisco and elsewhere exactly as it handles other power which it generates, buys or owns. Consumers of the power are billed by and pay the Company. The City buys Hetch-Hetchy power from the Company exactly as do other consumers. The City receives monthly payments from the Company on a fixed basis set out in the contract. The price received by the City has remained constant from 1925 to date although rates to the consumers have varied in the interim. In the event of the refusal, failure or inability of the Company to take the available output of the City’s plant in accordance with the agreement, the amount of energy which the City could have delivered is the basis of making the monthly payment, and the Company must pay for power delivered to it whether actually disposed of by resale or not. The rate paid by consumers for the Hetch-Hetchy power is not fixed by the City, as it could be under the Constitution of California, 20 but is fixed by the State Railroad Commission just as the price of *28 all other power sold by the Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Company in California is fixed. Thus, in brief, the City does not itself distribute and sell the power directly to consumers; it has not provided competition with the private power company; and it has transferred the right to sell and distribute the power to a private power company in violation of the express prohibition of § 6 of the Act. Terminology of consignment of power, rather than of transfer by sale, and verbal description of the power Com-' pany as the City’s agent or consignee, are not sufficient to take the actions of the parties under the contract out of § 6. Congress, in effect trustee of public lands for all the people, has by this Act sought to protect and control the disposition of a section of the public domain. The City has in fact followed a course of conduct which Congress, by § 6, has forbidden. Mere words and ingenuity of contractual expression, whatever their effect between the parties, cannot by description make permissible a course of conduct forbidden by law. When we look behind the word description of the arrangement between the City and the power Company to what was actually done, we see that the City has — contrary to the terms of § 6 — abdicated its control over the sale and ultimate distribution of Hetch-Hetchy power. There remain only the determinations whether the prohibitions of § 6 are constitutional and can be enforced in equity. Second. The prohibitions of § 6 are challenged by the City as an unconstitutional invasion of the rights of the State of California on the ground that they attempt to regulate the manner in which electricity shall be disposed of in San Francisco. And the City therefore insists that these prohibitions must be considered only as covenants in a contract between the City and the United States. Upon this premise, the City has argued here, as it did in *29 the Court of Appeals, that alleged equitable defenses render the covenants unenforceable. When the Raker Bill was before Congress, the City filed with the Public Lands Committee of the House a brief and argument in support of the Bill. Citing authorities, including this Court’s opinions, and legislative precedents, the City submitted to Congress that as grantee it would be bound by and as grantor Congress was empowered to impose “the conditions set forth in the Hetch-Hetchy bill.” 21 After passage of the Bill the City accepted the grant by formal ordinance, assented to all the conditions contained in the grant, constructed the required power and water facilities, and up to date has utilized the rights, privileges and benefits granted by Congress. Now, the City seeks to retain the benefits of the Act while attacking the constitutionality of one of its important conditions. 22 Article 4, § 3, Cl. 2 of the Constitution provides that “The Congress shall have Power to dispose of and make all heedful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory and other Property belonging to the United States.” The power over the public land thus entrusted to Congress is without limitations. 23 “And it is not for the courts to say how that trust shall be administered. That is for Con *30 gress to determine.” 24 Thus, Congress may constitutionally limit the disposition of the public domain to a manner consistent with its views of public policy. And the policy to govern disposal of rights to develop hydroelectric power in such public lands may, if Congress chooses, be one designed to avoid monopoly and to bring about a wide-spread distribution of benefits. The statutory requirement that Hetch-Hetchy power be publicly distributed does not represent an exercise of a general control over public policy in a State but instead only an exercise of the complete power which Congress has over particular public property entrusted to it. 25 Third. Finally, on the basis of numerous objections to the District Court’s judgment, assigned as errors in the court below and pressed here, the City denies the Government’s right — upon a balancing of equities — to.relief by injunction even if the present disposition of Hetch-Hetchy power be in violation of the Act. However, after consideration of all these objections, we are satisfied that this case does not call for a balancing of equities or for the invocation of the generalities of judicial maxims in order to determine whether an injunction should have issued. The City is availing itself of valuable rights and privileges granted by the Government and yet persists in violating the very conditions upon which those benefits were granted. Congress provided “That the grantee [City] shall at all times comply with and observe on its part all the conditions specified in this Act, and in the event that the same are not reasonably complied, with and carried out by the grantee, upon written request of the Secretary of the Interior, it is made the duty of the Attorney General in the name of the United *31 States to commence all necessary suits or proceedings in the proper court having jurisdiction thereof, for the purpose of enforcing and carrying out the provisions of this Act.” Pursuant to this legislative mandate, the present suit was instituted to enforce covenants exacted from a grantee of rights in the public domain by a Congress sympathetic with the local needs of San Francisco but also jealous of its own responsibility to dispose of such rights in a manner de'emed by it most likely to render their benefits widespread. The equitable doctrines relied on do not militate against the capacity of a court of equity as a proper forum in which to make a declared policy of Congress effective. Injunction to prohibit continued use — in violation of that policy — of property granted by the United States, and to enforce the grantee’s covenants, is both appropriate and necessary. 26 A substantial part of the City’s argument rests upon its claim that the Department of the Interior in the period from 1913 to 1937 construed § 6 to forbid no more than sale of power for resale. We are asked to accept these administrative interpretations. And in addition the City suggests that conduct of the Department, of which these interpretations were a part, is sufficient to create an estoppel against the Government. Whether the Department at any time ever did more than merely to tolerate sale and distribution of Hetch-Hetchy power by the Company as a temporary expedient is doubtful. Certain it is, however, that in 1935 the Secretary of the Interior declared the City’s disposition of the power through the Company to be a violation of § 6, demanded discontinuance of this violation without success and thereafter instigated this proceeding. We cannot accept the contention that administrative rulings — such as those here *32 relied on — can thwart the plain purpose of a valid law. As to estoppel, it is enough to repeat that “ . . . the United States is neither bound nor estopped by acts of its officers or agents in entering into an arrangement or agreement to do or cause to- be done what the law does not sanction or permit.” 27 The judgment of the Circuit Court is reversed. The judgment of the District Court is affirmed and we remand the case to it. Reversed.  Justice McReynolds is of the opinion that the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals should be affirmed. 1 c. 4, 38 Stat. 242. 2 The City and County of San Francisco is a municipal corporation of California and will be referred to here as the City. 3 Section 9 (u) of the Act contains the following: “Provided, however, That the grantee shall at all times comply with and observe on its part all the conditions specified in this Act, and in the event that the same are not reasonably complied with and carried but by the grantee, upon written request of the Secretary of the Interior, it is made the duty of the Attorney General in the name of the United States to commence all necessary suits or proceedings in the proper court having jurisdiction thereof, for the purpose of enforcing and carrying out the provisions of this Act.” 38 Stat. 250. 4 23 F.

Senator Pittman, one of the Bill’s sponsors and a Member of the reporting Committee, stated that the Bill provided “absolutely that neither this water nor this power can ever fall into the hands of a monopoly.” 50 Cong. Rec., Part 6, p. 5473. 16 “See, e. g., views of Senator Smoot, who opposed the measure: “. . . I was opposed to the regulations that were put in this bill, and that is what I was opposed to more than any other thing. I wanted the question of regulations taken out of the controversy and the bill reported to the Senate without those regulations in it. “Mr. President, I do not think there ought to be any misunderstanding about this matter. The Senator himself, I think, will admit that the principal object of this bill is to provide for the creation of power, . . .” “. . .1 will, moreover, say that it is my opinion that the reason San Francisco wants this particular dam site is for the power that she thinks can be developed cheaper than from any other source, and at the same time get a large supply of water. That is my personal opinion.” 51 Cong. Rec., Part 1, pp. 304, 314, 360. 17 “The people who ride on street cars, the people who use electric lights,.the people who are now using gas, those who eventually will *26 use coal for purposes of heat, and those who use water for washing purposes will all receive all the benefit there is in this legislation without any rake-off by any corporation or monopoly.” Senator Norris, 51 Cong. Rec., Part 1, p. 347. 18 Senator Clark, of Wyoming, also opposed to the power provision of the Bill, said with reference to Senator McCumber’s amendment: “. . . The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. McCumber] has prepared an amendment to the bill which accomplishes all the purposes which the proponents of the bill claim are desired, leaving out the objectionable features, which have nothing whatever to do with the water supply of the city of San Francisco.” 51 Cong.

Similar, views were entertained in Congress upon tbe effect of the conditions.

       "      <td>\\n\\n  Me. Justice Reed\\n \\n\\n  delivered the opinion of the Court.\\n \\n\\n  This appeal involves the validity of the Public Revenue Service Tax Act of Colorado.\\n  \\n   1\\n  \\n  The act, § 5, imposes upon the services specified in the act, a percentage tax based upon the value of the services rendered or performed by any person subject to its provisions.\\n \\n\\n \\n   *44\\n   \\n  Section 5 (c) imposes a tax equivalent to two per cent of the value of services rendered by “banks, finance companies, trust companies and depositories . . .” The person rendering the services “shall be liable and responsible for the payment of the entire amount ...” § 6. He is required to remit all taxes collected and due the state from him to the treasurer less three per cent to cover the expense of the service. Under § 6 (B) persons rendering or performing the services are required “as far as practicable, [to] add the taix imposed ... to- the value of services or charges showing such tax as a separate and distinct item and when added such tax shall constitute a part of such value of service or charge, shall be a debt from the user to the person rendering or performing service until paid, and shall be recoverable at law in the same manner as other debts.” By subsection (d) the person rendering the service is forbidden to hold out directly or indirectly that he will assume or absorb the tax. By § 7 the user may recover illegally collected taxes. Where services are rendered which become a part of an article subject to a sales fax, the services are exempt and the person performing the service recovers where they are illegally assessed. § 3. By § 12, all sums paid by the user as taxes axe public money and trust funds of the State of Colorado. It is made a'misdemeanor, § 17, for any person rendering or performing services to refuse to make the returns required. The state treasurer is made administrator of the act and given authority to issue regulations. § 19. The usual separability clause is contained in the act. § 22.\\n \\n\\n  The definitions of the act appear in § 2. By its subsection (c) the term “services rendered or performed” is defined as those rendered for a valuable consideration by a person covered by the act for the ultimate user thereof.\\n \\n\\n  “The term 'user’ shall mean the person for whom or for whose benefit services are rendered or performed.”\\n   \\n   *45\\n   \\n  By subsection (e) taxpayer is defined as “any person obligated to account to the state treasurer for taxes collected or to be collected or due the state under the terms of this act.” Subsection (h) provides for a credit on future taxes of a tax paid on accounts eventually found worthless.\\n \\n\\n  Under the rules and regulations issued by the treasurer on the Public Revenue Service Tax Act, the service tax is construed as invalid as applied to so-called banking services.\\n  \\n   2\\n  \\n\\n\\n  Under rule 27, however, such service as the furnishing of safety vaults by depositories or banks is held to come within the act, and the two per cent tax applies to the charges made for this service. These regulations were approved by the judgment and decree of the trial court and that judgment was affirmed in all particulars by the Supreme Court of Colorado.\\n \\n\\n  While § 4 (a) makes it unlawful for any person to render the defined services without “first having obtained a license therefor,” the treasurer demands no license fees from a national bank. Such exception was held proper by the lower court.\\n  \\n   3\\n  \\n\\n\\n  The appellant here, the Colorado National Bank, was a national banking corporation duly organized and existing under the national banking act. The bank operated a safe-deposit service under its own name and in the building and vaults used for its other banking activities. The rentals received for the use of that portion of. its vaults utilized for safe-deposit boxes were reported to the Comptroller of the Currency as income in the bank; the fixtures employed in the business are-part of the assets of the bank and are supervised by the Comptroller of the Currency.\\n \\n\\n \\n   *46\\n   \\n  The appellee Bedford, as treasurer of the State of Colorado and administrator of the Service Tax Act, demanded payment from appellant bank of two per cent of the value of the services rendered by the bank to its safe deposit box customers. The bank refused payment and the treasurer brought this action under the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act (Colorado Stat. Anno., 1935, c. 93, §§ 78-79) for a declaration of rights to the effect that the services performed by the bank are taxable pursuant to the Service Tax Act. The bank answered claiming the state statute as applied to it was repugnant to the Constitution and laws of the United States; setting up the immunity of national banks from state taxation except as permitted by R. S. § 5219;\\n  \\n   4\\n  \\n  claiming that the safe-deposit business of national banks was authorized by Congress and therefore was part of its federally authorized business, immune from taxation whether the bank or the user of its services is the taxpayer. The bank further contended that even though it is not the taxpayer and the tax burden as such is not unlawful, the burden of collection, report- and visitation materially interfere with the performance of its national banking functions. A general demurrer to the answer was filed.\\n \\n\\n  The trial court sustained the bank. The supreme court first affirmed by an equally divided court and then on re\\n   \\n   *47\\n   \\n  hearing reversed\\n  \\n   5\\n  \\n  and remanded the case to the district court. The trial court entered a second judgment declaring as prayed by the treasurer which judgment was affirmed by the supreme court on the authority of the former decision.\\n \\n\\n  (1) This appeal is here under § 237 (a) of the Judicial Code. The treasurer makes the point that as the federal question raised was the immunity to the exaction of the bank as a federal instrumentality withdrawn from state taxation by congressional action, the determination that the tax was on a non-banking activity foreign to its federal character and on the user of the services eliminated the necessity of a decision on the federal question. As the statute was held valid after the conclusion of the Supreme Court of Colorado that the manner of state taxation of national banks must accord with R. S. § 5219 and must not interfere with federal functions,\\n  \\n   6\\n  \\n  it seems clear the federal question as to the validity of the statute as tested by the Constitution and laws of the United States was necessarily involved and decided. This gives this Court jurisdiction of the appeal.\\n  \\n   7\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n   Gully\\n  \\n  v.\\n  \\n   First National Bank,\\n  \\n\\n\\n    8\\n   \\n\\n\\n\\n  relied upon by the treasurer, dealt with the right to remove to a federal court\\n  \\n   9\\n  \\n  because the cause of action arose under the federal laws,\\n  \\n   10\\n  \\n  but the issue here is the right to appeal where a state statute is held valid against a defense of repug-nancy to the same laws.\\n  \\n   11\\n  \\n  The difference is brought out\\n   \\n   *48\\n   \\n  in the\\n  \\n   Gully\\n  \\n  case, where it is said: “If there were no federal law permitting the taxation of shares in national banks, a suit to recover such a tax would not be one arising under the Constitution of the United States, though the bank would have the aid of the Constitution when it came to its defense.”\\n  \\n   12\\n  \\n\\n\\n  (2) The genesis of the present system of national banks is the National Bank Act of June 3, 1864.\\n  \\n   13\\n  \\n  It was called “An Act to provide a National Currency, secured by a Pledge of United States Bonds and to provide for the Circulation and Redemption thereof.” From this act, correlated with the Federal Reserve Act,\\n  \\n   14\\n  \\n  there has' developed the present nationwide banking facilities. R. S. § 5153 makes these associations the depositories of public money. Though the national banks’ usefulness as an agency to provide for currency has diminished markedly, their importance as general bankers shows a constant growth.\\n  \\n   15\\n  \\n  We may assume that national banks possess only the powers conferred by Congress.\\n  \\n   16\\n  \\n  These are set out in R. S. § 5136 as frequently amended and include “all such incidental powers as shall be necessary to carry on the business of banking,” with the proviso “that in carrying on the business commonly known as the safe-\\n   \\n   *49\\n   \\n  deposit business the association shall not invest in the capital stock of a corporation organized under the law of any State to conduct a safe-deposit business in an amount in excess of 15 per centum of the capital stock of the association actually paid in and unimpaired and 15 per centum of its unimpaired surplus.”\\n  \\n   17\\n  \\n  We have recently found the authority to secure federal funds within these incidental powers, coupled with a long continued practice recognized by the Comptroller of the Currency.\\n  \\n   18\\n  \\n  The right to accept special deposits is recognized by the banking act.\\n  \\n   19\\n  \\n  These are monies and other valuables the identical deposits of which are kept, preserved and returned in kind. It differs little if at all from a safe-deposit business. The language of the proviso of § 24, just quoted, is the language suitable to impose restrictions on a recognized power, not the language that would be used in creating a new power. As the limitation on the power to invest in real estate protected in a measure customers and stockholders from risky investments,\\n  \\n   20\\n  \\n  the banks’ own investment in safety deposit facilities evidently did not seem to Congress to require the same regulation as the purchase of stock in a safe-deposit corporation. A subsidiary safe-deposit corporation would give priority to the creditors of the subsidiary over the depositors and other creditors of the bank itself. The obvious fact, known to all, is that national banks do and for many years have carried on a safe-deposit business. State banks, quite usually, are given the power to\\n   \\n   *50\\n   \\n  conduct a safe-deposit business.\\n  \\n   21\\n  \\n  We agree with the appellant bank that such a generally adopted method of safeguarding valuables must be considered a banking function authorized by Congress.\\n  \\n   22\\n  \\n\\n\\n  (3) We may assume, as did the Supreme Court of Colorado, that the tax is invalid if laid upon the bank as an instrumentality of government in the incidents referred to in the preceding section;\\n  \\n   23\\n  \\n  that its banking operations are free from state taxation except as Congress may permit;\\n  \\n   24\\n  \\n  that Congress permits the taxation only of shares and real estate;\\n  \\n   25\\n  \\n  and'that Congress may inter\\n   \\n   *51\\n   \\n  vene to protect its instrumentalities from any other tax which threatens their usefulness.\\n  \\n   26\\n  \\n\\n\\n  Congress has not legislated against taxation of the customers of national banks. This Court has approved a tax assessed upon the deposits of customers of national banks.\\n  \\n   27\\n  \\n  By § 6 of the Colorado act the “person rendering or performing services shall be liable” for the payment of the tax imposed. But as subsection (b) of that same section requires the tax paid to be added to the charges for service “as a separate and distinct item” and makes it a debt from the user of the services until paid, the tax is upon the user of the safe-deposit boxés, not upon the bank. Furthermore, as by § 2 (h) credit is given to the bank for taxes paid on accounts subsequently found worthless and the bank is in a position to require payment of box rentals and taxes in advance, there is no occasion for a bank ever to have saddled upon it any part of the tax burden.\\n \\n\\n  In\\n  \\n   National Bank\\n  \\n  v. Commonwealth\\n  \\n   28\\n  \\n  this Court determined a similar question in favor of the validity of the state tax. The case was decided in 1869. At that time the applicable federal statute\\n  \\n   29\\n  \\n  read: “Sec. 41. . . .\\n  \\n   Provided,\\n  \\n  That nothing in this act shall be construed to prevent all the shares in any of the said associations, held by any person . . . from being included in the valuation of the personal property of such person ... in the assessment of taxes imposed by or under state authority at the place where such bank is located, and not elsewhere. . . .”\\n \\n\\n  The statute of Kentucky laid a tax of fifty cents on each share. The same statute enacted: “The cashier of\\n   \\n   *52\\n   \\n  a bank, whose stock is taxed, shall, on the first day in July of each year, pay into the treasury the amount of tax due. If such tax be not paid, the cashier and his sureties shall be liable for the same, and twenty per cent, upon the amount; and the said bank or corporation shall thereby forfeit the privileges of its charter.”\\n \\n\\n  A national bank refused payment on the ground that it as a bank was not subject to state taxation. It was decided that this was a tax on shares, that the state in a .legal proceeding against the shareholder could have garnisheed the bank and that because the bank was a federal instrumentality was no reason for not requiring it to collect and pay over the money from the shareholder. A similar tax was upheld in\\n  \\n   Des Moines Bank\\n  \\n  v. Fairweather.\\n  \\n   30\\n  \\n\\n\\n  The person liable for the tax, primarily, cannot always be said to be the real taxpayer. The taxpayer is the person ultimately liable for the tax itself.\\n  \\n   31\\n  \\n  The funds which were received by the State came from the assets of the user, not from those of the federal instrumentality, the bank.\\n  \\n   32\\n  \\n  The Colorado Supreme Court holds the user is the taxpayer.\\n  \\n   33\\n  \\n  The determination of the state court as to the incidence of the tax has great weight with us and, when it follows logically the language of the act, as here, is controlling.\\n  \\n   34\\n  \\n  As the user directly furnishes the funds for the tax, not as an ultimate consumer with a transferred burden but by § 12 of the act as the responsible obligor, we conclude the tax is upon\\n   \\n   *53\\n   \\n  him, not upon the bank. The Constitution or laws of the United States do not forbid such a tax.\\n \\n\\n  (4) The tax being a permissible tax on customers of the bank, it is settled by our prior decisions that the statutory provisions requiring collection and remission of the taxes do not impose an unconstitutional burden on a federal instrumentality.\\n  \\n   35\\n  \\n  Especially is this true since the bank under the Colorado act is allowed three per cent of the tax for the financial burden put upon it by the obligation to collect.\\n \\n\\n\\n   Affirmed.\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n   1\\n  \\n\\n   Session Laws of Colorado, 1937, c. 240, p. 1144.

Code (1921), § 710-109, empowers banks to let out safe-deposit boxes. California, Gen.

       "      <td>Me. Justice delivered the opinion of the Court. This appeal involves the validity of the Public Revenue Service Tax Act of Colorado. 1 The act, § 5, imposes upon the services specified in the act, a percentage tax based upon the value of the services rendered or performed by any person subject to its provisions. *44 Section 5 (c) imposes a tax equivalent to two per cent of the value of services rendered by “banks, finance companies, trust companies and depositories . . .” The person rendering the services “shall be liable and responsible for the payment of the entire amount ...” § 6. He is required to remit all taxes collected and due the state from him to the treasurer less three per cent to cover the expense of the service. Under § 6 (B) persons rendering or performing the services are required “as far as practicable, [to] add the taix imposed ... to- the value of services or charges showing such tax as a separate and distinct item and when added such tax shall constitute a part of such value of service or charge, shall be a debt from the user to the person rendering or performing service until paid, and shall be recoverable at law in the same manner as other debts.” By subsection (d) the person rendering the service is forbidden to hold out directly or indirectly that he will assume or absorb the tax. By § 7 the user may recover illegally collected taxes. Where services are rendered which become a part of an article subject to a sales fax, the services are exempt and the person performing the service recovers where they are illegally assessed. § 3. By § 12, all sums paid by the user as taxes axe public money and trust funds of the State of Colorado. It is made a'misdemeanor, § 17, for any person rendering or performing services to refuse to make the returns required. The state treasurer is made administrator of the act and given authority to issue regulations. § 19. The usual separability clause is contained in the act. § 22. The definitions of the act appear in § 2. By its subsection (c) the term “services rendered or performed” is defined as those rendered for a valuable consideration by a person covered by the act for the ultimate user thereof. “The term 'user’ shall mean the person for whom or for whose benefit services are rendered or performed.” *45 By subsection (e) taxpayer is defined as “any person obligated to account to the state treasurer for taxes collected or to be collected or due the state under the terms of this act.” Subsection (h) provides for a credit on future taxes of a tax paid on accounts eventually found worthless. Under the rules and regulations issued by the treasurer on the Public Revenue Service Tax Act, the service tax is construed as invalid as applied to so-called banking services. 2 Under rule 27, however, such service as the furnishing of safety vaults by depositories or banks is held to come within the act, and the two per cent tax applies to the charges made for this service. These regulations were approved by the judgment and decree of the trial court and that judgment was affirmed in all particulars by the Supreme Court of Colorado. While § 4 (a) makes it unlawful for any person to render the defined services without “first having obtained a license therefor,” the treasurer demands no license fees from a national bank. Such exception was held proper by the lower court. 3 The appellant here, the Colorado National Bank, was a national banking corporation duly organized and existing under the national banking act. The bank operated a safe-deposit service under its own name and in the building and vaults used for its other banking activities. The rentals received for the use of that portion of. its vaults utilized for safe-deposit boxes were reported to the Comptroller of the Currency as income in the bank; the fixtures employed in the business are-part of the assets of the bank and are supervised by the Comptroller of the Currency. *46 The appellee Bedford, as treasurer of the State of Colorado and administrator of the Service Tax Act, demanded payment from appellant bank of two per cent of the value of the services rendered by the bank to its safe deposit box customers. The bank refused payment and the treasurer brought this action under the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act (Colorado Stat. Anno., 1935, c. 93, §§ 78-79) for a declaration of rights to the effect that the services performed by the bank are taxable pursuant to the Service Tax Act. The bank answered claiming the state statute as applied to it was repugnant to the Constitution and laws of the United States; setting up the immunity of national banks from state taxation except as permitted by R. S. § 5219; 4 claiming that the safe-deposit business of national banks was authorized by Congress and therefore was part of its federally authorized business, immune from taxation whether the bank or the user of its services is the taxpayer. The bank further contended that even though it is not the taxpayer and the tax burden as such is not unlawful, the burden of collection, report- and visitation materially interfere with the performance of its national banking functions. A general demurrer to the answer was filed. The trial court sustained the bank. The supreme court first affirmed by an equally divided court and then on re *47 hearing reversed 5 and remanded the case to the district court. The trial court entered a second judgment declaring as prayed by the treasurer which judgment was affirmed by the supreme court on the authority of the former decision. (1) This appeal is here under § 237 (a) of the Judicial Code. The treasurer makes the point that as the federal question raised was the immunity to the exaction of the bank as a federal instrumentality withdrawn from state taxation by congressional action, the determination that the tax was on a non-banking activity foreign to its federal character and on the user of the services eliminated the necessity of a decision on the federal question. As the statute was held valid after the conclusion of the Supreme Court of Colorado that the manner of state taxation of national banks must accord with R. S. § 5219 and must not interfere with federal functions, 6 it seems clear the federal question as to the validity of the statute as tested by the Constitution and laws of the United States was necessarily involved and decided. This gives this Court jurisdiction of the appeal. 7 Gully v. First National Bank, 8 relied upon by the treasurer, dealt with the right to remove to a federal court 9 because the cause of action arose under the federal laws, 10 but the issue here is the right to appeal where a state statute is held valid against a defense of repug-nancy to the same laws. 11 The difference is brought out *48 in the Gully case, where it is said: “If there were no federal law permitting the taxation of shares in national banks, a suit to recover such a tax would not be one arising under the Constitution of the United States, though the bank would have the aid of the Constitution when it came to its defense.” 12 (2) The genesis of the present system of national banks is the National Bank Act of June 3, 1864. 13 It was called “An Act to provide a National Currency, secured by a Pledge of United States Bonds and to provide for the Circulation and Redemption thereof.” From this act, correlated with the Federal Reserve Act, 14 there has' developed the present nationwide banking facilities. R. S. § 5153 makes these associations the depositories of public money. Though the national banks’ usefulness as an agency to provide for currency has diminished markedly, their importance as general bankers shows a constant growth. 15 We may assume that national banks possess only the powers conferred by Congress. 16 These are set out in R. S. § 5136 as frequently amended and include “all such incidental powers as shall be necessary to carry on the business of banking,” with the proviso “that in carrying on the business commonly known as the safe- *49 deposit business the association shall not invest in the capital stock of a corporation organized under the law of any State to conduct a safe-deposit business in an amount in excess of 15 per centum of the capital stock of the association actually paid in and unimpaired and 15 per centum of its unimpaired surplus.” 17 We have recently found the authority to secure federal funds within these incidental powers, coupled with a long continued practice recognized by the Comptroller of the Currency. 18 The right to accept special deposits is recognized by the banking act. 19 These are monies and other valuables the identical deposits of which are kept, preserved and returned in kind. It differs little if at all from a safe-deposit business. The language of the proviso of § 24, just quoted, is the language suitable to impose restrictions on a recognized power, not the language that would be used in creating a new power. As the limitation on the power to invest in real estate protected in a measure customers and stockholders from risky investments, 20 the banks’ own investment in safety deposit facilities evidently did not seem to Congress to require the same regulation as the purchase of stock in a safe-deposit corporation. A subsidiary safe-deposit corporation would give priority to the creditors of the subsidiary over the depositors and other creditors of the bank itself. The obvious fact, known to all, is that national banks do and for many years have carried on a safe-deposit business. State banks, quite usually, are given the power to *50 conduct a safe-deposit business. 21 We agree with the appellant bank that such a generally adopted method of safeguarding valuables must be considered a banking function authorized by Congress. 22 (3) We may assume, as did the Supreme Court of Colorado, that the tax is invalid if laid upon the bank as an instrumentality of government in the incidents referred to in the preceding section; 23 that its banking operations are free from state taxation except as Congress may permit; 24 that Congress permits the taxation only of shares and real estate; 25 and'that Congress may inter *51 vene to protect its instrumentalities from any other tax which threatens their usefulness. 26 Congress has not legislated against taxation of the customers of national banks. This Court has approved a tax assessed upon the deposits of customers of national banks. 27 By § 6 of the Colorado act the “person rendering or performing services shall be liable” for the payment of the tax imposed. But as subsection (b) of that same section requires the tax paid to be added to the charges for service “as a separate and distinct item” and makes it a debt from the user of the services until paid, the tax is upon the user of the safe-deposit boxés, not upon the bank. Furthermore, as by § 2 (h) credit is given to the bank for taxes paid on accounts subsequently found worthless and the bank is in a position to require payment of box rentals and taxes in advance, there is no occasion for a bank ever to have saddled upon it any part of the tax burden. In National Bank v. Commonwealth 28 this Court determined a similar question in favor of the validity of the state tax. The case was decided in 1869. At that time the applicable federal statute 29 read: “Sec. 41. . . . Provided, That nothing in this act shall be construed to prevent all the shares in any of the said associations, held by any person . . . from being included in the valuation of the personal property of such person ... in the assessment of taxes imposed by or under state authority at the place where such bank is located, and not elsewhere. . . .” The statute of Kentucky laid a tax of fifty cents on each share. The same statute enacted: “The cashier of *52 a bank, whose stock is taxed, shall, on the first day in July of each year, pay into the treasury the amount of tax due. If such tax be not paid, the cashier and his sureties shall be liable for the same, and twenty per cent, upon the amount; and the said bank or corporation shall thereby forfeit the privileges of its charter.” A national bank refused payment on the ground that it as a bank was not subject to state taxation. It was decided that this was a tax on shares, that the state in a .legal proceeding against the shareholder could have garnisheed the bank and that because the bank was a federal instrumentality was no reason for not requiring it to collect and pay over the money from the shareholder. A similar tax was upheld in Des Moines Bank v. Fairweather. 30 The person liable for the tax, primarily, cannot always be said to be the real taxpayer. The taxpayer is the person ultimately liable for the tax itself. 31 The funds which were received by the State came from the assets of the user, not from those of the federal instrumentality, the bank. 32 The Colorado Supreme Court holds the user is the taxpayer. 33 The determination of the state court as to the incidence of the tax has great weight with us and, when it follows logically the language of the act, as here, is controlling. 34 As the user directly furnishes the funds for the tax, not as an ultimate consumer with a transferred burden but by § 12 of the act as the responsible obligor, we conclude the tax is upon *53 him, not upon the bank. The Constitution or laws of the United States do not forbid such a tax. (4) The tax being a permissible tax on customers of the bank, it is settled by our prior decisions that the statutory provisions requiring collection and remission of the taxes do not impose an unconstitutional burden on a federal instrumentality. 35 Especially is this true since the bank under the Colorado act is allowed three per cent of the tax for the financial burden put upon it by the obligation to collect.

For example, Maine, Act of 1923, c. 144, § 6, (V), authorizes savings banks to “own, maintain and let safe deposit boxes and vaults.” Ohio, Gen. Code (1921), § 710-109, empowers banks to let out safe-deposit boxes. California, Gen. Laws (1923), Act 652, § 30, any bank may conduct a safe-deposit department, but shall not invest more than one tenth of its capital and surplus in such safe-deposit department. 22 The language of the proviso first appeared in an act to further amend the national banking laws of the Federal Reserve Act enacted February 25, 1927, 44 Stat. 1224, § 2 (b). Only immaterial verbal changes have occurred since the first adoption. Referring to this proviso the House report said: “The second proviso regulates the safe-deposit business of national banks and prohibits ihem from investing an amount in excess of 15 per cent of capital and surplus in a corporation organized to conduct a safe-deposit business in connection with the bank. This is a business which is regularly carried on by national banks and the effect of this provision is also primarily regulative.” H. Rep. No. 83, 69th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 4. 23 Cf. Osborn v. U. S.

       "      <td>\\n*58Mr. Justice Frankfurter\\ndelivered the opinion of the Court.\\nAppellants have challenged the validity of a Virginia statute regulating the insurance of Virginia risks and have brought this suit to enjoin state officers from enforcing *59it. Its relevant provisions, copied in the margin,1 forbid contracts of insurance or surety by companies authorized to do business within that Commonwealth “except through regularly constituted and registered resident agents or agencies of such companies.” § 4222, e. 218, Acts of 1938. Such resident agents “shall be entitled to and shall receive the usual and customary commissions allowed on such contracts,” and may not share more than half of this commission with a non-resident broker. § 4226-a. Disobedience of these provisions (from which life, title and marine companies are exempted) may entail a fine or revocation of the corporate license in Virginia, or both. A district court of three judges, convened under § 266 of the Judicial Code as amended, 28 U. S. C. § 380, dismissed appellants’ bill on the basis of elaborate findings of fact and conclusions of law, set forth in an opinion by Circuit Judge Soper. 29 F. Supp. 71. From this *60decree the case comes here on appeal under § 238 of the Judicial Code as amended, 28 U. S. C. § 345.\\nThe bill was brought by foreign corporations authorized to do casualty and surety business in Virginia, and by some of their salaried employees. It is their claim that the statute deprives them of rights protected by the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution. The exact nature of these claims will appear more clearly in the setting of the illuminating findings below which may here be abbreviated.\\nThe “production” of insurance — “production” being insurance jargon for obtaining business — is, in the main, carried on by two groups, agents and brokers. Though both are paid by commission, the different.ways in which the two groups perform their functions have important practical consequences in the conduct of the insurance business, and hence in its regulation. The agent is tied to *61his company. But his ability to “produce” business depends upon the confidence of the community in him. He must therefore cultivate the good will and sense of dependence of his clients. He may finance the payment of premiums; he frequently assists in the filing and prosecution of claims; he acts as mediator between insurer and assured in the diverse situations which arise. The broker, on the other hand, is an independent middleman, not tied to a particular company. He meets more specially the needs of large customers, using their concentrated bargaining power to obtain the most favorable terms from competing companies. His activities, being largely confined to the big commercial centers, take place mostly outside Virginia.\\nA policy, whether “produced” by broker or agent, must be “serviced” — an insurance term for assistance rendered a customer in minimizing his risks. To this end the companies exert themselves directly, but the “producer” may render additional service. Only to a limited extent can risks be minimized at long range; local activity is essential. When the contract is “produced” by a non-resident broker the “servicing” function is normally performed by the company exclusively. When the “producer” is a resident agent, the case is ordinarily otherwise. For this, as well as for other reasons, it is obvious that non-resident brokers prefer to negotiate their contracts covering Virginia risks with companies authorized to do business in that Commonwealth.\\nThese basic elements in the insurance business attain special significance in the case of enterprises operating not only in Virginia but in other states as well. For them the brokerage system offers the attractions of large-scale production. Through what is known as a master or “hotchpotch” policy, the assured may obtain a cheaper rate by pooling all his risks, whether in or out of Virginia. This wholesale insurance may furnish not only a reduced rate *62but a reduced commission to the customer. These are advantages which naturally draw the Virginia business of interstate enterprises away from local agents in Virginia to the great insurance centers.\\nIn affecting the cost of these master policies, say the appellants, Virginia is intruding upon business transactions beyond its borders. Not only is a licensed company forbidden to write insurance except through a resident agent, but the agent cannot retain less than one-half of the customary commission allowed on such a contract for what may, so far as the requirements of the law are concerned, be no&gt; more than the perfunctory service of countersigning the policy.\\nBut the question is not whether what Virginia has done will restrict appellants’ freedom of action outside Virginia by subjecting the exercise of such freedom to financial burde/ns. The mere fact that state action may have repercussions beyond state lines is of no judicial significance so long as the action is not within that domain which the Constitution forbids. Alaska Packers Assn. v. Comm’n, 294 U. S. 532; Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co. v. Grosjean, 301 U. S. 412. Compare Equitable Life Society v. Pennsylvania, 238 U. S. 143. It is equally immaterial that such state action may run counter to the economic wisdom either of Adam Smith or of J. Maynard Keynes, or may be ultimately mischievous even from the point of view of avowed state policy. Our inquiry must be much narrower. It is whether Virginia has taken hold of a matter within her power, or has reached beyond her borders to regulate a subject which was none of her concern because the Constitution has placed control elsewhere. Compare Wallace v. Hines, 253 U. S. 66, 69.\\nVirginia has not sought to prohibit the making of contracts beyond her borders. She merely claims that her interest in the risks which these contracts are designed to prevent warrants the kind of control she has here *63imposed. This legislation is not to be judged by abstracting an isolated contract written in New York from the organic whole of the insurance business, the effect of that business on Virginia, and Virginia’s regulation of it.\\nA network of legislation controls the surety and casualty business in Virginia. Insolvent companies may not engage in it. Virginia Code, § 4180. Neither companies nor agents may give rebates. § 4222-c. Rates for workmen’s compensation, automobile liability and surety contracts are determined by its Corporation Commission. §§ 1887 (75), 4326-ar-l, 4350-3. The difficulty of enforcing these regulations, so the District Court found, may be increased if policies covering Virginia risks are “produced” without participation by responsible local agents. Rebates evading local restriction may be granted under' cover of business done outside the state. Contrariwise, if resident Virginia agents are made necessary conduits for insurance on Virginia risks now included in master policies, the state may have better means of acquiring accurate information for the effectuation of measures which it deems protective of its interests.2\\n*64It is claimed that the requirement that not less than one-half of the customary commission be retained by the resident agent is a bald exaction for what may be no more than the perfunctory service of countersigning policies. The short answer to this is that the state may rely on this exaction as a mode of assuring the active use of resident agents for procuring and “servicing” policies covering Virginia risks. These functions, when adequately performed, benefit not only the company, the producer, and the assured. By minimizing the risks of casualty and loss, they redound in a pervasive way to the benefit of the community.3 At least Virginia may so have believed. And she may also have concluded that an agency system, such as this legislation was designed to promote, is better calculated to further these desirable ends than other modes of “production.” 4 When *65these beliefs are emphasized by legislation embodying similar notions of policy in a dozen states,5 it would savor of intolerance for us to suggest that a legislature could not constitutionally entertain the views which the legislation adopts. Compare Prudential Ins. Co. v. Cheek, 259 U. S. 530, 537.\\nThe present case, therefore, is wholly unlike those instances in which a “so-called right is used as part of a scheme to accomplish a forbidden result.” Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co. v. Tafoya, 270 U. S. 426, 434. For it is clear that Virginia has a definable interest in the contracts she seeks to regulate and that what she has done is very different from the imposition of conditions upon appellants’ privilege of engaging in local business which would bring within the orbit of state power matters unrelated to any local interests. It is not our province to measure the social advantage to Virginia of regulating the conduct of insurance companies within her borders insofar as it affects Virginia risks. Government has always had a special relation to insurance. The ways of safeguarding against the untoward manifestations of nature and other vicissitudes of life have long been withdrawn from the benefits and caprices of free competition.6 The state may fix insurance rates, German Alliance Ins. Co. v. Lewis, 233 U. S. 389; it may regulate the compensation of agents, *66O’Gorman &amp; Young v. Hartford Fire Ins. Co., 282 U. S. 251; it may curtail drastically the area of free contract, National Ins. Co. v. Wanberg, 260 U. S. 71. States have controlled the expenses of insurance companies, New York Insurance Law, Consolidated Laws of New York, c. 28, § 244, and Wisconsin Statutes, § 201.21; and see Report of Joint (Armstrong) Insurance Investigation Committee (N. Y.) pp. 403-18 (1906). They have also promoted insurance through savings banks; see Berman, The Massachusetts System of Savings Bank Life Insurance, Bulletin No. 615, IT. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, and New York Laws of 1938, c. 471. In the light of all these exertions of state power it does not seem possible to doubt that the state could, if it chose, go into the insurance business, just as it can operate warehouses, flour mills, and other business ventures, Green v. Frazier, 253 U. S. 233, or might take “the whole business of banking under its control,” Noble State Bank v. Haskell, 219 U. S. 104, 113. If the state, as to local risks, could thus preempt the field of insurance for itself, it may stay its intervention short of such a drastic step' by insisting that its own residents shall have a share in devising and safeguarding protection against its local hazards. La Tourette v. McMaster, 248 U. S. 465. All these are questions of policy not for us to judge. For it can never be emphasized too much that one’s own opinion as to the wisdom of a law must be wholly excluded when one is doing one’s judicial duty. The limit of our inquiry is reached when we conclude that Virginia has exerted its powers as to matters within the bounds of her control.\\nIn reaching this conclusion we have been duly mindful of the cases urged upon us by appellants. In Allgeyer v. Louisiana, 165 U. S. 578, apart from the doubts that have been cast upon the opinion in that case, the state attempted to penalize the making of contracts by its residents outside its borders with companies which had never subjected themselves to local control. Thus the statute *67was thought to be directed not at the regulation of insurance within the state, but at the making of contracts without. This was followed in St. Louis Compress Co. v. Arkansas, 260 U. S. 346; but see the refined distinctions drawn in Compañia de Tabacos v. Collector, 275 U. S. 87. In Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co. v. Tafoya, supra, the Court found that New Mexico had exceeded its power by forbidding “the payment of any emolument of any nature to any [non-resident] for the obtaining, placing or writing of any policy covering risks in New Mexico.” The Court was of opinion that this statute went “beyond any legitimate interest of the State, . . .” ibid. at 435, but carefully withheld its judgment as to the validity of a later New Mexico statute not unlike the Virginia law here under review.7\\nThe decree must be\\n\\nAffirmed.\\n\\n\\n The relevant portions of the Virginia statute are as follows: “Section 4222. ... (a) Insurance companies, legally authorized to do business in this State, except life, title and ocean marine insurance companies, shall not make contracts of insurance or surety on persons or property herein, except through regularly constituted and registered resident agents or agencies of such companies; no contract of insurance or surety covering persons or property in this State, except contracts of life, title and ocean marine insurance and except temporary binders covering other forms of insurance shall be written, issued or delivered by any such authorized insurance company, or any of its representatives, unless such contract is duly countersigned in writing by a resident agent or agency of such company; provided, however, that the countersignature of an insurance agency shall not be considered valid unless such countersignature be attested to in writing by a regularly constituted and registered resident agent of such company.\\n“No State agent, special agent, company representative, salaried officer, manager or other salaried representative of any legally authorized insurance company, except a mutual insurance company, shall countersign any contract of insurance or surety, or any renewal thereof, covering persons or property in this State, except contracts of life, title and ocean marine insurance; provided that this section *60shall not apply to railroad companies and other common carriers engaged in interstate commerce.\\n“Section 4226-a. ... No resident agent or agency may write, countersign, issue or deliver any contract of insurance or surety upon persons or property in this State unless there shall be collected at the time the contract is written, issued or delivered, or within a reasonable time thereafter, the full premium on such contract, and the resident agent or agency shall be entitled to and shall receive the usual and customary- commissions allowed on such contracts, provided that such resident agent or agency may write such contracts at the request only of such other resident agents or agencies, when such agent or agencies are properly licensed to transact the class of business involved in such exchange, and licensed non-resident insurance brokers who may be authorized by law to broker such contracts, and on exchange of business between resident agents or agencies in Virginia and licensed non-resident insurance brokers in other states the resident agent or agency in Virginia may allow or pay to such licensed non-resident insurance brokers, a commission not exceeding fifty per centum of the resident agent’s or agency’s commission allowed on such business.”\\n\\n\\n Where out-of-state “production” actually leads to rebating in defiance of § 4222-c, there would seem little'doubt of a substantial basis for Virginia's contention that the requirement of participation by a resident agent will make the illegal practices more susceptible of detection and control. Cf. La Tourette v. McMaster, 248 U. S. 465. Virginia has also contended that the master policy makes it possible for the companies to reduce their rates below the requirements of state law, and to attribute the reductions to risks in other states with requirements less stringent than those of Virginia. Appellants strenuously contend that no law of Virginia prohibits the reduction of rates for out-of-state risks to compensate for the higher rates which might be required by Virginia and, therefore, there is no illegal practice in this connection which the existence of a resident agent could aid in uncovering. This argument, if met on the merits, would lead us into the particularities of Virginia's rate laws. It is enough to say that even if these practices are not illegal, Virginia *64may have a legitimate interest in discovering the extent of their prevalence in order to devise, if she so chooses, effective laws to prevent them.\\n\\n\\n See Hardy, Risk and Risk-Bearing, pp. 9-28, 66-67; Kulp, Casualty Insurance, pp. 188-91, 467-68; Michelbacher, Casualty Insurance Principles, pp. 448-78, 583-84; Crobaugh and Redding, Casualty Insurance, pp. 17-20; Huebner, Foreword to Modern Insurance Tendencies, 157 Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, pp. 3-4; Burns, Service of Casualty Insurance, 15th Annual Meeting, Chamber of Commerce of the United States, p. 4.\\n\\n\\n “The broker is not required to render any technical service beyond the placing of business.” Michelbacher, Casualty Insurance Principles, p. 403.

But even if the broker does “service” the contract, his activities will take place in Virginia, and will affect the welfare of those inside Virginia who may be subject to the incidence of those risks which the “servicing” function tends to reduce. If this be true, it is Virginia’s concern and not ours to prefer the agency to the brokerage method of “production.”\\n\\n\\n Alabama Code, § 8379; Kansas, General Statute (Supp.), c. 40, § 246; Louisiana, Acts of 1918, No. 153; Maryland, Annotated Code, Art. 48A, § 65; Mississippi, Code, § 5205; Montana, Laws of 1937, c. 95; Oklahoma, Statutes Ann., Title 36, §§ 126, 142, 249; South Carolina, Code, § 7972; South Dakota, Code, § 31.2218; Washington, Rev.

[the company’s] duty to make payment there.” 292 U. S. at 149. At the time the contract was entered into Mississippi had no interest in the risk covered. The Court felt that, even at the time of suit, “performance at most involved only the casual payment of money in Mississippi,” ibid, at 150, and that was an interest so subordinate to that of Tennessee that the latter was entitled to have the right of way. No question was thus involved touching the right of a state to regulate companies doing business within its borders as to contracts of insurance covering local risks.\\n\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>*58Mr. Justice delivered the opinion of the Court. Appellants have challenged the validity of a Virginia statute regulating the insurance of Virginia risks and have brought this suit to enjoin state officers from enforcing *59it. Its relevant provisions, copied in the margin,1 forbid contracts of insurance or surety by companies authorized to do business within that Commonwealth “except through regularly constituted and registered resident agents or agencies of such companies.” § 4222, e. 218, Acts of 1938. Such resident agents “shall be entitled to and shall receive the usual and customary commissions allowed on such contracts,” and may not share more than half of this commission with a non-resident broker. § 4226-a. Disobedience of these provisions (from which life, title and marine companies are exempted) may entail a fine or revocation of the corporate license in Virginia, or both. A district court of three judges, convened under § 266 of the Judicial Code as amended, 28 U. S. C. § 380, dismissed appellants’ bill on the basis of elaborate findings of fact and conclusions of law, set forth in an opinion by Circuit Judge Soper. 29 F. Supp. 71. From this *60decree the case comes here on appeal under § 238 of the Judicial Code as amended, 28 U. S. C. § 345. The bill was brought by foreign corporations authorized to do casualty and surety business in Virginia, and by some of their salaried employees. It is their claim that the statute deprives them of rights protected by the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution. The exact nature of these claims will appear more clearly in the setting of the illuminating findings below which may here be abbreviated. The “production” of insurance — “production” being insurance jargon for obtaining business — is, in the main, carried on by two groups, agents and brokers. Though both are paid by commission, the different.ways in which the two groups perform their functions have important practical consequences in the conduct of the insurance business, and hence in its regulation. The agent is tied to *61his company. But his ability to “produce” business depends upon the confidence of the community in him. He must therefore cultivate the good will and sense of dependence of his clients. He may finance the payment of premiums; he frequently assists in the filing and prosecution of claims; he acts as mediator between insurer and assured in the diverse situations which arise. The broker, on the other hand, is an independent middleman, not tied to a particular company. He meets more specially the needs of large customers, using their concentrated bargaining power to obtain the most favorable terms from competing companies. His activities, being largely confined to the big commercial centers, take place mostly outside Virginia. A policy, whether “produced” by broker or agent, must be “serviced” — an insurance term for assistance rendered a customer in minimizing his risks. To this end the companies exert themselves directly, but the “producer” may render additional service. Only to a limited extent can risks be minimized at long range; local activity is essential. When the contract is “produced” by a non-resident broker the “servicing” function is normally performed by the company exclusively. When the “producer” is a resident agent, the case is ordinarily otherwise. For this, as well as for other reasons, it is obvious that non-resident brokers prefer to negotiate their contracts covering Virginia risks with companies authorized to do business in that Commonwealth. These basic elements in the insurance business attain special significance in the case of enterprises operating not only in Virginia but in other states as well. For them the brokerage system offers the attractions of large-scale production. Through what is known as a master or “hotchpotch” policy, the assured may obtain a cheaper rate by pooling all his risks, whether in or out of Virginia. This wholesale insurance may furnish not only a reduced rate *62but a reduced commission to the customer. These are advantages which naturally draw the Virginia business of interstate enterprises away from local agents in Virginia to the great insurance centers. In affecting the cost of these master policies, say the appellants, Virginia is intruding upon business transactions beyond its borders. Not only is a licensed company forbidden to write insurance except through a resident agent, but the agent cannot retain less than one-half of the customary commission allowed on such a contract for what may, so far as the requirements of the law are concerned, be no&gt; more than the perfunctory service of countersigning the policy. But the question is not whether what Virginia has done will restrict appellants’ freedom of action outside Virginia by subjecting the exercise of such freedom to financial burde/ns. The mere fact that state action may have repercussions beyond state lines is of no judicial significance so long as the action is not within that domain which the Constitution forbids. Alaska Packers Assn. v. Comm’n, 294 U. S. 532; Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co. v. Grosjean, 301 U. S. 412. Compare Equitable Life Society v. Pennsylvania, 238 U. S. 143. It is equally immaterial that such state action may run counter to the economic wisdom either of Adam Smith or of J. Maynard Keynes, or may be ultimately mischievous even from the point of view of avowed state policy. Our inquiry must be much narrower. It is whether Virginia has taken hold of a matter within her power, or has reached beyond her borders to regulate a subject which was none of her concern because the Constitution has placed control elsewhere. Compare Wallace v. Hines, 253 U. S. 66, 69. Virginia has not sought to prohibit the making of contracts beyond her borders. She merely claims that her interest in the risks which these contracts are designed to prevent warrants the kind of control she has here *63imposed. This legislation is not to be judged by abstracting an isolated contract written in New York from the organic whole of the insurance business, the effect of that business on Virginia, and Virginia’s regulation of it. A network of legislation controls the surety and casualty business in Virginia. Insolvent companies may not engage in it. Virginia Code, § 4180. Neither companies nor agents may give rebates. § 4222-c. Rates for workmen’s compensation, automobile liability and surety contracts are determined by its Corporation Commission. §§ 1887 (75), 4326-ar-l, 4350-3. The difficulty of enforcing these regulations, so the District Court found, may be increased if policies covering Virginia risks are “produced” without participation by responsible local agents. Rebates evading local restriction may be granted under' cover of business done outside the state. Contrariwise, if resident Virginia agents are made necessary conduits for insurance on Virginia risks now included in master policies, the state may have better means of acquiring accurate information for the effectuation of measures which it deems protective of its interests.2 *64It is claimed that the requirement that not less than one-half of the customary commission be retained by the resident agent is a bald exaction for what may be no more than the perfunctory service of countersigning policies. The short answer to this is that the state may rely on this exaction as a mode of assuring the active use of resident agents for procuring and “servicing” policies covering Virginia risks. These functions, when adequately performed, benefit not only the company, the producer, and the assured. By minimizing the risks of casualty and loss, they redound in a pervasive way to the benefit of the community.3 At least Virginia may so have believed. And she may also have concluded that an agency system, such as this legislation was designed to promote, is better calculated to further these desirable ends than other modes of “production.” 4 When *65these beliefs are emphasized by legislation embodying similar notions of policy in a dozen states,5 it would savor of intolerance for us to suggest that a legislature could not constitutionally entertain the views which the legislation adopts. Compare Prudential Ins. Co. v. Cheek, 259 U. S. 530, 537. The present case, therefore, is wholly unlike those instances in which a “so-called right is used as part of a scheme to accomplish a forbidden result.” Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co. v. Tafoya, 270 U. S. 426, 434. For it is clear that Virginia has a definable interest in the contracts she seeks to regulate and that what she has done is very different from the imposition of conditions upon appellants’ privilege of engaging in local business which would bring within the orbit of state power matters unrelated to any local interests. It is not our province to measure the social advantage to Virginia of regulating the conduct of insurance companies within her borders insofar as it affects Virginia risks. Government has always had a special relation to insurance. The ways of safeguarding against the untoward manifestations of nature and other vicissitudes of life have long been withdrawn from the benefits and caprices of free competition.6 The state may fix insurance rates, German Alliance Ins. Co. v. Lewis, 233 U. S. 389; it may regulate the compensation of agents, *66O’Gorman &amp; Young v. Hartford Fire Ins. Co., 282 U. S. 251; it may curtail drastically the area of free contract, National Ins. Co. v. Wanberg, 260 U. S. 71. States have controlled the expenses of insurance companies, New York Insurance Law, Consolidated Laws of New York, c. 28, § 244, and Wisconsin Statutes, § 201.21; and see Report of Joint (Armstrong) Insurance Investigation Committee (N. Y.) pp. 403-18 (1906). They have also promoted insurance through savings banks; see Berman, The Massachusetts System of Savings Bank Life Insurance, Bulletin No. 615, IT. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, and New York Laws of 1938, c. 471.

I think it sanctions an exertion of power by Virginia over transactions beyond her jurisdiction.\\n*68Virginia may, of course, regulate the making of contracts of insurance within her borders. She may require such contracts to embody specified provisions. She may regulate the enforcement of these contracts in her courts. She may supervise and condition the activities of registered foreign insurance companies, agents or brokers within the Commonwealth. The statute in question has no such purpose.\\nThe purpose and effect of the statute are to compel an insurance company which is a citizen of another state, and which negotiates a contract of insurance with an agent or broker within such other state, to pay a resident of Virginia for a service not rendered by him, but rendered by another in another state. By force of the statute a Virginia agent must countersign a contract negotiated outside of Virginia with an assured whose residence is outside of Virginia, which contract of insurance was negotiated by an agent or broker living outside of Virginia. The countersigning Virginia agent must be paid one-half the usual commission, even though the broker or agent who produced the business is licensed as a non-resident broker by Virginia, although the only service such Virginia agent is required to render and, in many cases all he does render, is the mere countersignature of the policy. With respect to this situation the court below said:\\n■ “We do not overlook the peculiar situation of the nonresident assured who form no part of the Virginia public which the state desires to protect. Undoubtedly their business methods will be disturbed by the enforcement of the statute. It is contended, not without merit, that they have no need for the services of the resident commission agents, and that in fact, the latter cannot assume the function of producing agents in their behalf without harmfully intruding themselves into confidential business affairs. Moreover, it is fair to say that these affairs are so important and so widespread in their scope as to be *69beyond the technical knowledge and skill of the average Virginia agent, and that the interests of the non-resident assureds can be best looked after by the brokers at the great centers of population where the head offices of the insurance companies and of the assureds are located, and in Virginia by the engineering and claim personnel of the companies. It is also true that the substantial compensation required by the statute to be paid to the Virginia agents will increase the cost of the business.”\\nThe plain effort of Virginia is to compel a nonresident to pay a resident of Virginia for services which the latter does not in fact render and is not required to render. The principles underlying former decisions of this court are at war with the existence of any such asserted power.1\\nThe Chief Justice and MR. Justice McReynolds join in this opinion.\\n\\n Allgeyer v. Louisiana, 165 U. S. 578; New York Life Ins. Co. v. Head, 234 U. S. 149; Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Dunken, 266 U.

       "      <td>Justice dissenting: I am unable to- agree with the decision in this case. I think it sanctions an exertion of power by Virginia over transactions beyond her jurisdiction. *68Virginia may, of course, regulate the making of contracts of insurance within her borders. She may require such contracts to embody specified provisions. She may regulate the enforcement of these contracts in her courts. She may supervise and condition the activities of registered foreign insurance companies, agents or brokers within the Commonwealth. The statute in question has no such purpose. The purpose and effect of the statute are to compel an insurance company which is a citizen of another state, and which negotiates a contract of insurance with an agent or broker within such other state, to pay a resident of Virginia for a service not rendered by him, but rendered by another in another state. By force of the statute a Virginia agent must countersign a contract negotiated outside of Virginia with an assured whose residence is outside of Virginia, which contract of insurance was negotiated by an agent or broker living outside of Virginia. The countersigning Virginia agent must be paid one-half the usual commission, even though the broker or agent who produced the business is licensed as a non-resident broker by Virginia, although the only service such Virginia agent is required to render and, in many cases all he does render, is the mere countersignature of the policy. With respect to this situation the court below said: ■ “We do not overlook the peculiar situation of the nonresident assured who form no part of the Virginia public which the state desires to protect. Undoubtedly their business methods will be disturbed by the enforcement of the statute. It is contended, not without merit, that they have no need for the services of the resident commission agents, and that in fact, the latter cannot assume the function of producing agents in their behalf without harmfully intruding themselves into confidential business affairs. Moreover, it is fair to say that these affairs are so important and so widespread in their scope as to be *69beyond the technical knowledge and skill of the average Virginia agent, and that the interests of the non-resident assureds can be best looked after by the brokers at the great centers of population where the head offices of the insurance companies and of the assureds are located, and in Virginia by the engineering and claim personnel of the companies. It is also true that the substantial compensation required by the statute to be paid to the Virginia agents will increase the cost of the business.” The plain effort of Virginia is to compel a nonresident to pay a resident of Virginia for services which the latter does not in fact render and is not required to render. The principles underlying former decisions of this court are at war with the existence of any such asserted power.1 The Chief Justice and  Justice McReynolds join in this opinion. Allgeyer v.

       "      <td>*109  Justice delivered the opinion of the Court. This case presents the question whether regulations embodied in a municipal ordinance abridge the freedom of speech or of the press secured against state invasion by the Fourteenth Amendment. 1 Section 2 of an ordinance of Shasta County, California, provides: “It shall be unlawful for any person, in or upon any public street, highway, sidewalk, alley or other public place in the County of Shasta, State of California, to loiter in front of, or in the vicinity of, or to picket in front of, or in the vicinity of, or to carry, show or display any banner, transparency, badge or sign in front of, or in the vicinity of, any works, or factory, or any place of business or employment, for the purpose of inducing or influencing, or attempting to induce or influence, any person to refrain from entering any such works, or factory, or place of business, or employment, or for the purpose of inducing or influencing, or attempting to induce or influence, any person to refrain from purchasing or using any goods, wares, merchandise, or other articles, manufactured, made or kept for sale therein, or for the purpose of inducing or influencing, or attempting to induce or influence, any person to refrain from doing or performing any service or labor in any works, factory, place of business or employment, or for the purpose of intimidating, threatening or coercing, or attempting to intimidate, threaten or coerce any person who is performing, seeking or obtaining service or labor in any such works, factory, place of business or employment.” 2 *110 Appellant was one of a group of twenty-nme men engaged in “picketing” on U. S. Highway 99 in front of the Delta Tunnel Project in Shasta County. “The picketing consisted of walking [on the edge of the highway nearest the project] a distance of 50 to 100 feet in a general northerly direction, then turning around and retracing steps and continuing as before ... all of the walking in connection with the picketing . . . was done off the paved portion of the highway and on the gravelled portion of the right-of-way, that is, on public property.” Some of the pickets carried signs, similar to those described in the margin, 3 in such a manner that workers on the project and persons going along the highway in either direction could read them. The sign carried by appellant bore the legend: “This job is unfair to CIO.” These activities occurred between the hours of 7:30 and 9:00 a. m. During this period vehicles and persons passed freely without any molestation or interference through the picket line from the highway to the project and from the project to the highway, and the traffic of persons and automobiles along the highway was not obstructed. Appellant did not threaten or intimidate or coerce anyone, did not make any loud noises at any time, and was peaceful and orderly in his demeanor. The *111 pickets committed no acts of violence, and there was no breach of the peace. The county officers arrested appellant and charged that he did “loiter, picket, and display signs and banners in a public place and in and upon a public highway in front of, and in the vicinity of the Delta Tunnel Project . . . for the purpose of inducing and influencing persons to refrain from doing and performing services and labor” at the project in violation of the ordinance. The Justice’s Court of Township Number Nine found him “guilty of violating the Shasta County Anti-Picketing Law,” rendered judgment accordingly, and imposed sentence. The Superior Court of Shasta County affirmed the judgment. That court upheld the ordinance, over appellant’s claim of unconstitutionality, on the authority of a prior decision. 4 The case comes here on appeal. 5 Our decision in Thornhill v. Alabama, ante, p. 88, goes far toward settling the issues presented here. Under that decision, § 2 of the ordinance in question is to be judged upon its face. 6 Section 2 on its face declares it unlawful for any person to carry or display any sign or banner or badge in the vicinity of any place of business for the purpose of inducing or attempting to induce any person to refrain from purchasing merchandise or performing services or labor. It likewise makes it unlawful for any person to loiter or *112 picket in the vicinity of any place of business for a similar purpose. The terms \"loiter” and “picket” are not defined either in the ordinance or in authoritative state decisions. Therefore, they must be judged as covering all the activities embraced by the prohibition against the carrying of signs in the vicinity of a labor dispute for the purpose mentioned. 7 The ordinance does not proscribe the carrying of signs in other places or for the purpose of inducing or attempting to induce others to adopt courses of action not related to labor disputes.

The sweeping and inexact terms of the ordinance disclose the threat to freedom of speech inherent in its existence. It cannot be thought to differ in any material respect from the statute held void in Thornhill’s case. The carrying of signs and banners, no less than the raising of a flag, is a natural and appropriate means of convey *113 ing information on matters of public concern. Stromberg v. California, 283 U. S. 359. For the reasons set forth in our opinion in Thornhill v. Alabama, supra, publicizing the facts of a labor dispute in a peaceful way through appropriate means, whether by pamphlet, by word of mouth or by banner, must now be regarded as within that liberty of communication which is secured to every person by the Fourteenth Amendment against abridgment by a State. The power and duty of the State to take adequate steps to preserve the peace and protect the privacy, the lives, and the property of its residents cannot be doubted. But the ordinance in question here abridges liberty of discussion under circumstances presenting no clear and present danger of substantive evils within the allowable area of state control. Reversed. Me. Justice McReynolds is of opinion that the judgment below should be affirmed. 1 “It is also well settled that municipal ordinances adopted under state authority constitute state action and are within the prohibition of the amendment.” Lovell v. Griffin, 303 U. S. 444, 450; Schneider v. State, 308 U. S. 147. 2 Section 1 declares that it shall be unlawful for any person “to make any loud or unusual noise, or to speak in a loud or unusual *110 tone, or to cry out or proclaim, for the purposes of inducing or influencing, or attempting to induce or influence, any person” to refrain from entering, or purchasing merchandise from, or performing any service in, any place of business. The State did not charge that this section was violated. 3 Four signs were admitted in evidence as typical. They were of white card board, approximately 14 x 22 inches in size, and were tacked upon a stick some 34 inches long, 1% inches wide and % inch thick.

McCracken argued the cause for petitioners. With him on the brief was John B. Leake.\\nMyron C. Baum argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief were Solicitor General Rankin, Assistant Attorney General Rice and Harry Baum.\\nMR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN delivered the opinion of the Court.\\nThe question before the Court is whether the proceeds of certain insurance policies on the life of the decedent, payable to named beneficiaries and irrevocably assigned by the insured, should be included in the estate of the decedent for the purposes of the federal estate tax. The facts are not in dispute. In 1934 decedent, then aged 76, purchased a series of annuity-life insurance policy combinations. Three single-premium life insurance policies, at face values of $200,000, $100,000, and $50,000, respectively, were obtained without the requirement of a medical examination. As a condition to selling decedent each life insurance policy, the companies involved required decedent also to purchase a separate, single-premium, nonrefundable life annuity policy. The premiums for each life insurance policy and for each annuity policy were fixed at regular rates. The size of each annuity, however, was calculated so that in the event the annuitant-insured died prematurely the annuity premium, less the amount allocated to annuity payments already made, would combine with the companion life insurance premium, plus interest, to equal the amount of insurance proceeds to be paid.[1] Each annuity policy could have *276 been purchased without the insurance policy for the same premium charged for it under the annuity-life insurance combination.\\nThe decedent's children were primary beneficiaries of the insurance policies; the Fidelity-Philadelphia Trust Company, as trustee of a trust established by decedent, was named beneficiary of the interests of any of decedent's children who predeceased her. In the year of purchase, decedent assigned all rights and benefits under two of the life insurance policies to her children and under the other to the Fidelity-Philadelphia Trust Company as trustee. These rights and benefits included the rights to receive dividends, to change the beneficiaries, to surrender the policies, and to assign them. Dividends were received, but, as far as the record discloses, none of the other rights was exercised. A gift tax on these transfers was paid by the decedent in 1935. In 1938 decedent amended the above-mentioned trust so that it became irrevocable. As the Government concedes, the decedent retained no beneficial or reversionary interest in the trust.\\nThe insured died in 1946. The proceeds of the three insurance policies were not included in her estate in the estate tax return. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue determined that these proceeds should have been included and assessed a deficiency accordingly. The adjusted tax was paid by the executors, and when claim for refund was denied, this action for refund followed. The District Court entered judgment for the taxpayers, but the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed. 241 F.2d 690. We granted certiorari.[2] 354 U.S. 921.\\n*277 It is conceded by the parties that the question of whether the proceeds should be included in the estate is not determinable by the federal estate tax provision dealing with life insurance proceeds. Cf. Helvering v. Le Gierse, 312 U.S. 531. To support the decision below, the Government argues that the proceeds are includible in the estate under Section 811 (c) (1) (B) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, which includes, in the estate of the decedent, property, to the extent of the decedent's interest therein, which the decedent had transferred without adequate and full consideration, under which transfer the decedent\\n\"has retained for his life . . .(i) the possession or enjoyment of, or the right to income from, the property . . . .\"\\nThe Government contends that the annuity payments, which were retained until death, were income from property transferred by the decedent to her children through the use of the life insurance policies.\\nOn the other hand, petitioners, executors of the estate, assert that the annuity payments were income from the annuity policies, which were separate property from the insurance policies, and that since decedent had assigned away the life insurance policies before death, she retained no interest in them at death.\\nThe Government relies on Helvering v. Le Gierse, supra, where this Court also had before it the issue of the taxability of proceeds from a life insurance policy in an annuity-life insurance combination. After holding that the taxability of these proceeds was not to be determined for estate tax purposes according to the statutory provisions dealing with life insurance,[3] the Court held that *278 the proceeds were includible in the estate under Section 302 (c) of the Revenue Act of 1926 because they devolved on the beneficiaries in a transfer which took \"effect in possession or enjoyment at or after . . . death.\" 312 U.S., at 542. However, in reaching this conclusion the decision did not consider the problem in the case at bar, for in Le Gierse the insured had retained the rights and benefits of the insurance policy until death. The facts in the instant case on this point are fundamentally different. Prior to death, the decedent had divested herself of all interests in the insurance policies, including the possibility that the funds would return to her or her estate if the beneficiaries predeceased her.[4] The assignees became the \"owners\" of the policies before her death; they had received the right to the immediate and unlimited use of the policies to the full extent of their worth. The immediate value of the policies was always substantial. In the year of assignment their total cash surrender value was over $289,000; in the year of death it was over $326,000. Under the assignment, the decedent had not *279 become a life tenant who postpones the possession and enjoyment of the property by the remaindermen until her death.[5] Cf. Helvering v. Bullard, 303 U.S. 297; Commissioner v. Estate of Church, 335 U.S. 632. On the contrary, the assignees held the bundle of rights, the incidents of ownership, over property from which the decedent had totally divorced herself. Cf. Chase National Bank v. United States, 278 U.S. 327; Goldstone v. United States, 325 U.S. 687.\\nIllustrative of the distinction between Helvering v. Le Gierse and the case at bar is the fact that the Government has not endeavored here to sustain the tax under the statutory provision applied in that case. Instead of the provision taxing transfers \"intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after\" the transferor's death,[6] the provision applied in Le Gierse, the Government relies on the provision taxing transfers in which the transferor has retained until death \"the right to income from\" the transferred property.[7] However, the Government's position that the annuities were income from property *280 which the insured transferred to her children under the life insurance policies is not well taken.\\nTo establish its contention, the Government must aggregate the premiums of the annuity policies with those of the life insurance policies and establish that the annuity payments were derived as income from the entire investment. This proposition cannot be established. Admittedly, when the policies were purchased, each life insurance-annuity combination was the product of a single, integrated transaction. However, the parties neither intended that, nor acted as if, any of the transactions would have a quality of indivisibility. Regardless of the considerations prompting the insurance companies to hedge their life insurance contracts with annuities, each time an annuity-life insurance combination was written, two items of property, an annuity policy and an insurance policy, were transferred to the purchaser. The annuity policy could have been acquired separately, and the life insurance policy could have been, and was, conveyed separately. The annuities arose from personal obligations of the insurance companies which were in no way conditioned on the continued existence of the life insurance contracts. These periodic payments would have continued unimpaired and without diminution in size throughout the life of the insured even if the life insurance policies had been extinguished.[8] Quite clearly the *281 annuity payments arose solely from the annuity policies. The use and enjoyment of the annuity policies were entirely independent of the life insurance policies.

As the principal, in that event, would be includable in the settlor's estate for federal estate tax purposes, so here the proceeds of the insurance policies should be included in this decedent's estate.

On the contrary, by requiring a concurrent purchase of a nonrefundable annuity contract, the company had neutralized the risk at the expense of the \"insured.\" The remaining risk, whether the annuitant would live beyond the actuarial prediction and after the insurance policy had been surrendered, was considered not an insurance risk but a risk of ordinary investment.

Decided April 28, 1958. CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT. *275 Robert T. McCracken argued the cause for petitioners. With him on the brief was John B. Leake. Myron C. Baum argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief were Solicitor General Rankin, Assistant Attorney General Rice and Harry Baum.  CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN delivered the opinion of the Court. The question before the Court is whether the proceeds of certain insurance policies on the life of the decedent, payable to named beneficiaries and irrevocably assigned by the insured, should be included in the estate of the decedent for the purposes of the federal estate tax. The facts are not in dispute. In 1934 decedent, then aged 76, purchased a series of annuity-life insurance policy combinations. Three single-premium life insurance policies, at face values of $200,000, $100,000, and $50,000, respectively, were obtained without the requirement of a medical examination. As a condition to selling decedent each life insurance policy, the companies involved required decedent also to purchase a separate, single-premium, nonrefundable life annuity policy. The premiums for each life insurance policy and for each annuity policy were fixed at regular rates. The size of each annuity, however, was calculated so that in the event the annuitant-insured died prematurely the annuity premium, less the amount allocated to annuity payments already made, would combine with the companion life insurance premium, plus interest, to equal the amount of insurance proceeds to be paid.[1] Each annuity policy could have *276 been purchased without the insurance policy for the same premium charged for it under the annuity-life insurance combination. The decedent's children were primary beneficiaries of the insurance policies; the Fidelity-Philadelphia Trust Company, as trustee of a trust established by decedent, was named beneficiary of the interests of any of decedent's children who predeceased her. In the year of purchase, decedent assigned all rights and benefits under two of the life insurance policies to her children and under the other to the Fidelity-Philadelphia Trust Company as trustee. These rights and benefits included the rights to receive dividends, to change the beneficiaries, to surrender the policies, and to assign them. Dividends were received, but, as far as the record discloses, none of the other rights was exercised. A gift tax on these transfers was paid by the decedent in 1935. In 1938 decedent amended the above-mentioned trust so that it became irrevocable. As the Government concedes, the decedent retained no beneficial or reversionary interest in the trust. The insured died in 1946. The proceeds of the three insurance policies were not included in her estate in the estate tax return. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue determined that these proceeds should have been included and assessed a deficiency accordingly. The adjusted tax was paid by the executors, and when claim for refund was denied, this action for refund followed. The District Court entered judgment for the taxpayers, but the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed. 241 F.2d 690. We granted certiorari.[2] 354 U.S. 921. *277 It is conceded by the parties that the question of whether the proceeds should be included in the estate is not determinable by the federal estate tax provision dealing with life insurance proceeds. Cf. Helvering v. Le Gierse, 312 U.S. 531. To support the decision below, the Government argues that the proceeds are includible in the estate under Section 811 (c) (1) (B) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, which includes, in the estate of the decedent, property, to the extent of the decedent's interest therein, which the decedent had transferred without adequate and full consideration, under which transfer the decedent \"has retained for his life . . .(i) the possession or enjoyment of, or the right to income from, the property . . . .\" The Government contends that the annuity payments, which were retained until death, were income from property transferred by the decedent to her children through the use of the life insurance policies. On the other hand, petitioners, executors of the estate, assert that the annuity payments were income from the annuity policies, which were separate property from the insurance policies, and that since decedent had assigned away the life insurance policies before death, she retained no interest in them at death. The Government relies on Helvering v. Le Gierse, supra, where this Court also had before it the issue of the taxability of proceeds from a life insurance policy in an annuity-life insurance combination. After holding that the taxability of these proceeds was not to be determined for estate tax purposes according to the statutory provisions dealing with life insurance,[3] the Court held that *278 the proceeds were includible in the estate under Section 302 (c) of the Revenue Act of 1926 because they devolved on the beneficiaries in a transfer which took \"effect in possession or enjoyment at or after . . . death.\" 312 U.S., at 542. However, in reaching this conclusion the decision did not consider the problem in the case at bar, for in Le Gierse the insured had retained the rights and benefits of the insurance policy until death. The facts in the instant case on this point are fundamentally different. Prior to death, the decedent had divested herself of all interests in the insurance policies, including the possibility that the funds would return to her or her estate if the beneficiaries predeceased her.[4] The assignees became the \"owners\" of the policies before her death; they had received the right to the immediate and unlimited use of the policies to the full extent of their worth. The immediate value of the policies was always substantial. In the year of assignment their total cash surrender value was over $289,000; in the year of death it was over $326,000. Under the assignment, the decedent had not *279 become a life tenant who postpones the possession and enjoyment of the property by the remaindermen until her death.[5] Cf. Helvering v. Bullard, 303 U.S. 297; Commissioner v. Estate of Church, 335 U.S. 632. On the contrary, the assignees held the bundle of rights, the incidents of ownership, over property from which the decedent had totally divorced herself. Cf. Chase National Bank v. United States, 278 U.S. 327; Goldstone v. United States, 325 U.S. 687. Illustrative of the distinction between Helvering v. Le Gierse and the case at bar is the fact that the Government has not endeavored here to sustain the tax under the statutory provision applied in that case. Instead of the provision taxing transfers \"intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after\" the transferor's death,[6] the provision applied in Le Gierse, the Government relies on the provision taxing transfers in which the transferor has retained until death \"the right to income from\" the transferred property.[7] However, the Government's position that the annuities were income from property *280 which the insured transferred to her children under the life insurance policies is not well taken. To establish its contention, the Government must aggregate the premiums of the annuity policies with those of the life insurance policies and establish that the annuity payments were derived as income from the entire investment. This proposition cannot be established. Admittedly, when the policies were purchased, each life insurance-annuity combination was the product of a single, integrated transaction. However, the parties neither intended that, nor acted as if, any of the transactions would have a quality of indivisibility. Regardless of the considerations prompting the insurance companies to hedge their life insurance contracts with annuities, each time an annuity-life insurance combination was written, two items of property, an annuity policy and an insurance policy, were transferred to the purchaser. The annuity policy could have been acquired separately, and the life insurance policy could have been, and was, conveyed separately. The annuities arose from personal obligations of the insurance companies which were in no way conditioned on the continued existence of the life insurance contracts. These periodic payments would have continued unimpaired and without diminution in size throughout the life of the insured even if the life insurance policies had been extinguished.[8] Quite clearly the *281 annuity payments arose solely from the annuity policies. The use and enjoyment of the annuity policies were entirely independent of the life insurance policies. Because of this independence, the Commissioner may not, by aggregating the two types of policies into one investment, conclude that by receiving the annuities, the decedent had retained income from the life insurance contracts.[9] Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is Reversed.  JUSTICE BURTON, with whom  JUSTICE BLACK and  JUSTICE CLARK join, dissenting. For the reasons stated by the court below, 241 F.2d 690, and also in Conway v. Glenn, 193 F.2d 965, and Burr v. Commissioner, 156 F.2d 871, it seems to me that, for federal estate tax purposes, this case is indistinguishable from one in which a settlor places a sum in trust under such terms that he shall receive the income from it for life, and the principal shall be payable to designated beneficiaries upon his death. As the principal, in that event, would be includable in the settlor's estate for federal estate tax purposes, so here the proceeds of the insurance policies should be included in this decedent's estate. Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals. NOTES [1] Of course, an additional amount is added to the premiums to compensate the insurance companies for expenses.

Solomon, Samuel Karp and Ernest L. Folk III.\\nMR. JUSTICE CLARK delivered the opinion of the Court.\\nPetitioners stand convicted on a single-count indictment charging a conspiracy under § 1 of the Sherman Act. They contend that the trial judge erred in refusing to permit them to inspect the grand jury minutes covering the testimony before that body of a key government witness at the trial. The Court of Appeals affirmed the convictions, 260 F.2d 397. With reference to the present claim, it held that Rule 6 (e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure[1] committed the inspection or not of grand jury minutes to the sound discretion of the trial judge, *397 and that in this instance, no abuse of that discretion had been shown. We granted certiorari limited to the question posed by this ruling. 358 U.S. 917, 918. We conclude that in the circumstances of this case the trial court did not err in refusing to make Jonas' grand jury testimony available to petitioners for use in cross-examination.\\nThe indictment returned in the case named as defendants seven corporations, all manufacturers of mirrors, and three of their officers. However, only three of the corporations are petitioners here, along with one individual, J. A. Messer, Sr. The indictment charged a conspiracy to fix the price of plain plate glass mirrors sold in interstate commerce. It is not necessary for our purposes to detail the facts of this long trial, the record of which covers 860 pages. It is sufficient to say that the Government proved its case through 10 witnesses, the last of whom was Jonas. He was President of a large North Carolina mirror manufacturing company and had a reputation for independence in the industry. Although neither he nor his corporation was indicted, the latter was made a co-conspirator. The evidence indicates that the conspiracy was consummated at two meetings held on successive days during the week of the annual meeting of the Mirror Manufacturers Association in 1954 at Asheville, North Carolina. Jonas, not being a member of the Association, did not attend the convention. Talk at the convention regarding prices culminated in telephone calls by several representatives of mirror manufacturers to Jonas concerning his attitude on raising prices. On the day following these calls Jonas and three of the participants in the conspiracy met at an inn away from the convention headquarters and discussed \"prices.\" Within three days thereafter each of the manufacturers announced an identical price increase, which was approximately 10 percent. Jonas' testimony, of course, was confined to the telephone calls and the meeting at the inn *398 where the understanding was finalized. The Government admits that he was an \"important\" witness. However, proof of the conspiracy was overwhelming aside from Jonas' testimony. While he was the only witness who characterized the outcome of the meetings as an \"agreement\" on prices, no witness negatived this conclusion and the identical price lists that followed the meeting at the inn were little less than proof positive.\\nAfter the conclusion of Jonas' testimony, defense counsel interrogated him as to the number of times he appeared and the subject of his testimony before the grand jury. Upon ascertaining that Jonas had testified three times on \"the same general subject matter,\" counsel moved for the delivery of the grand jury minutes. He stated that the petitioners had \"a right . . . to inspect the Grand Jury record of the testimony of this witness after he has completed his direct examination\" relating to \"the same general subject matter\" as his trial testimony.[2] As authority for \"the automatic delivery of Grand Jury transcripts\" under such circumstances counsel cited Jencks v. United States, 353 U.S. 657 (1957). As previously indicated, the motion was denied.\\nIt appears to us clear that Jencks v. United States, supra, is in nowise controlling here. It had nothing to do with grand jury proceedings and its language was not intended to encompass grand jury minutes. Likewise, it is equally clear that Congress intended to exclude those minutes from the operation of the so-called Jencks Act, 71 Stat. 595, 18 U.S. C. (Supp. V, 1958) § 3500.[3]\\nPetitioners concede, as they must, that any disclosure of grand jury minutes is covered by Fed. Rules Crim. Proc. 6 (e) promulgated by this Court in 1946 after the *399 approval of Congress. In fact, the federal trial courts as well as the Courts of Appeals have been nearly unanimous in regarding disclosure as committed to the discretion of the trial judge.[4] Our cases announce the same principle,[5] and Rule 6 (e) is but declaratory of it.[6] As recently as last Term we characterized cases where grand jury minutes are used \"to impeach a witness, to refresh his recollection, to test his credibility and the like\" as instances of \"particularized need where the secrecy of the proceedings is lifted discretely and limitedly.\" United States v. Procter &amp; Gamble, 356 U.S. 677, 683 (1958).\\nPetitioners argue, however, that the trial judge's discretion under Rule 6 (e) must be exercised in accordance with the rationale of Jencks; namely, upon a showing on cross-examination that a trial witness testified before the grand juryand nothing morethe defense has a \"right\" to the delivery to it of the witness' grand jury testimony.\\nThis conclusion, however, runs counter to \"a long-established policy\" of secrecy, United States v. Procter &amp; Gamble, supra, at 681, older than our Nation itself. The reasons therefor are manifold, id., at 682, and are compelling when viewed in the light of the history and modus operandi of the grand jury. Its establishment in the Constitution \"as the sole method for preferring charges in serious criminal cases\" indeed \"shows the high place it [holds] as an instrument of justice.\" Costello v. United States, 350 U.S. 359, 362 (1956). Ever since this action *400 by the Fathers, the American grand jury, like that of England, \"has convened as a body of laymen, free from technical rules, acting in secret, pledged to indict no one because of prejudice and to free no one because of special favor.\" Ibid. Indeed, indictments may be returned on hearsay, or for that matter, even on the knowledge of the grand jurors themselves. Id., at 362, 363. To make public any part of its proceedings would inevitably detract from its efficacy. Grand jurors would not act with that independence required of an accusatory and inquisitorial body. Moreover, not only would the participation of the jurors be curtailed, but testimony would be parsimonious if each witness knew that his testimony would soon be in the hands of the accused. Especially is this true in antitrust proceedings where fear of business reprisal might haunt both the grand juror and the witness. And this \"go slow\" sign would continue as realistically at the time of trial as theretofore.\\nIt does not follow, however, that grand jury minutes should never be made available to the defense. This Court has long held that there are occasions, see United States v. Procter &amp; Gamble, supra, at 683, when the trial judge may in the exercise of his discretion order the minutes of a grand jury witness produced for use on his cross-examination at trial. Certainly \"disclosure is wholly proper where the ends of justice require it.\" United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., supra, at 234.\\nThe burden, however, is on the defense to show that \"a particularized need\" exists for the minutes which outweighs the policy of secrecy. We have no such showing here. As we read the record the petitioners failed to show any need whatever for the testimony of the witness Jonas. They contended only that they had a \"right\" to the transcript because it dealt with subject matter generally covered at the trial. Petitioners indicate that the trial judge required a showing of contradiction *401 between Jonas' trial and grand jury testimony. Such a preliminary showing would not, of course, be necessary. While in a colloquy with counsel the judge did refer to such a requirement, we read his denial as being based on the breadth of petitioners' claim. Petitioners also claim error because the trial judge failed to examine the transcript himself for any inconsistencies. But we need not consider that problem because petitioners made no such request of the trial judge. The Court of Appeals apparently was of the view that even if the trial judge had been requested to examine the transcript he would not have been absolutely required to do so. It is contended here that the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has reached a contrary conclusion. United States v. Spangelet, 258 F.2d 338. Be that as it may, resolution of that question must await a case where the issue is presented by the record. The short of it is that in the present case the petitioners did not invoke the discretion of the trial judge, but asserted a supposed absolute right, a right which we hold they did not have. The judgment is therefore.\\nAffirmed.\\nMR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE, MR. JUSTICE BLACK and MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS join, dissenting.\\nIn the words of the Court of Appeals, Jonas was the Government's \"principal prosecuting witness.\"[1] He was President of Lenoir Mirror Company, which company was *402 a participant in the alleged price-fixing conspiracy, but was not indicted. After Jonas testified on direct examination defense counsel asked for the production of his relevant grand jury testimony. The trial judge immediately made clear his intention not to grant the motion: \"Unless you can show some sound basis that contradicts between what happened in the Grand Jury room and his testimony before the Grand Jury and his testimony in this trial, I am not going to require the production of the Grand Jury records. It would be easy for any attorney to get access to the records of the Grand Jury by just such a motion as you are making here.\" Defense counsel protested, \"we are not attempting that. We want just a transcript of his testimony before the Grand Jury regarding the subjects to which he has testified on direct examination.\" (Emphasis supplied.) This request thus encompassed all of Jonas' grand jury testimony only if all of that testimony covered the subject matter of Jonas' trial testimony. The court replied, \"You have stated what you want to ask him and I am denying your right to do it.\" Plainly defense counsel were not asking to see the minutes of the entire grand jury proceedings, nor even of all of Jonas' testimony before the grand jury unless all of it was on the same subject matter as his trial testimony. Their motion was carefully limited to a request for so much of Jonas' grand jury testimony as \"covered the substance of his testimony on direct examination.\" This request that secrecy be \"lifted discretely and limitedly,\" United States v. Procter &amp; Gamble, 356 U.S. 677, 683, necessarily implied a request that the trial judge inspect the grand jury minutes and turn over to the defense only those parts dealing with Jonas' testimony on the same subject matter as his trial testimony. In this posture, then, the question for our decision is the narrow one whether the trial judge erred in denying the defense request for inspection of the grand jury testimony of a *403 key government witness which covered the subject matter of that witness' trial testimony.[2] I dissent from the Court's affirmance of the trial judge's ruling denying this carefully circumscribed request.\\nGrand jury secrecy is, of course, not an end in itself. Grand jury secrecy is maintained to serve particular ends. But when secrecy will not serve those ends or when the advantages gained by secrecy are outweighed by a countervailing interest in disclosure, secrecy may and should be lifted, for to do so in such a circumstance would further the fair administration of criminal justice. See McNabb v. United States, 318 U.S. 332. It is true that secrecy is not to be lifted without a showing of good reason, but it is too late in the day to say, as the Court as a practical matter does here, that the Government may insist upon grand jury secrecy even when the possible prejudice to the accused in a criminal case is crystal clear and none of the reasons justifying secrecy is present. \"[A]fter the grand jury's functions are ended, disclosure is wholly proper where the ends of justice require it.\" United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 310 U.S. 150, 234. Thus grand jury minutes have been made available to a defendant accused of committing perjury before the grand jury so that he could adequately prepare his defense, United States v. Remington, 191 F.2d 246; United States v. Rose, 215 F.2d 617, and to a defendant who can show an inconsistency between the trial testimony and grand jury testimony of a government witness, United States v. Alper, 156 F.2d 222; Burton v. United States, 175 F.2d 960; Herzog v. United States, 226 F.2d 561; United States v. H. J. K. Theatre Corp., 236 F.2d 502. On occasion the Government itself has recognized the fairness of permitting the defense access to the grand jury testimony of *404 government witnesses even though it considered that it was not bound to do so, United States v. Grunewald, 162 F. Supp. 621. This Court has implied that grand jury minutes would be discoverable by a defendant in a civil antitrust suit instituted by the Government on a showing of \"particularized need,\" United States v. Procter &amp; Gamble, 356 U.S. 677, 683.[3] Nor can we overlook that the Government uses grand jury minutes to further its own interests in litigation. It is apparently standard practice for government attorneys to use grand jury minutes in preparing a case for trial, see United States v. Procter &amp; Gamble, 356 U.S. 677, 678, in refreshing the recollection of government witnesses at trial, see United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 310 U.S. 150, 233, and, when the need arises, in impeaching witnesses at trial, see United States v. Cotter, 60 F.2d 689. Of course, when the Government uses grand jury minutes at trial the defense is ordinarily entitled to inspect the relevant testimony in those minutes. United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 310 U.S. 150, 233; United States v. Cotter, 60 F.2d 689. Indeed, Rule 6 (e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal *405 Procedure itself recognizes that grand jury testimony is discoverable under appropriate circumstances.[4]\\nThe Court apparently agrees with the conclusion compelled by these precedents, for its opinion states that grand jury minutes are discoverable when \" `a particularized need' exists for the minutes which outweighs the policy of secrecy.\" But the Court pays only lip service to the principle in view of the result in this case. It is clear beyond question, I think, that the application of that principle to this case requires a holding that Jonas' grand jury testimony is discoverable to the limited extent sought. Since there are no valid considerations which militate in favor of grand jury secrecy in this case, simple justice requires that the petitioners be given access to the relevant portions of Jonas' grand jury testimony so that they have a fair opportunity to refute the Government's case.\\nEssentially four reasons have been advanced as justification for grand jury secrecy.[5] (1) To prevent the accused from escaping before he is indicted and arrested or from tampering with the witnesses against him. (2) To prevent disclosure of derogatory information presented to the grand jury against an accused who has not been indicted. (3) To encourage complainants and witnesses to come before the grand jury and speak freely without fear that their testimony will be made public thereby subjecting them to possible discomfort or retaliation. (4) To encourage the grand jurors to engage in uninhibited investigation and deliberation by barring disclosure of their votes and comments during the proceedings.\\n*406 None of these reasons dictates that Jonas' grand jury testimony, to the limited extent it is sought, should be kept secret. The Court, while making obeisance to \"a long-established policy\" of secrecy, makes no showing whatever how denial of Jonas' grand jury testimony serves any of the purposes justifying secrecy. Certainly disclosure at this stage of the proceedings would not enable the defendants to escape from custody or to tamper with the witness who has already testified against them on direct examination. Certainly, also, protection of an innocent accused who has not been indicted has no bearing on this case. Discovery has been sought only of Jonas' grand jury testimony on the same subject matter as his testimony at trial. This testimony will have condemned someone to whom he did not refer at trial only if he has concealed information at the trial, and this creates the very situation in which it is imperative that the defense have access to the grand jury testimony if we are to adhere to the standards we have set for ourselves to assure the fair administration of criminal justice in the federal courts. Similarly, disclosure of Jonas' relevant grand jury testimony could not produce the apprehended results of retaliation or discomfort which might induce a reluctance in others to testify before grand juries. Jonas has already taken the stand and testified freely in open court against the defendants. His testimony has been extremely damaging. Disclosure of his testimony before the grand jury is hardly likely to result in any embarrassment that his trial testimony has not already produced. \"If he tells the truth, and the truth is the same as he testified before the grand jury, the disclosure of the former testimony cannot possibly bring to him any harm . . . which his testimony on the open trial does not equally tend to produce.\" 8 Wigmore, Evidence (3d ed. 1940), § 2362, at 725. Witnesses before a grand jury necessarily know that once called by the Government to testify at trial they cannot *407 remain secret informants quite apart from whether their grand jury testimony is discoverable. Finally, the defense seeks nothing which would disclose the votes or opinions of any of the grand jurors involved in these proceedings. All that is sought is the relevant testimony of Jonas. If there are questions by grand jurors intertwined with Jonas' testimony disclosure of which would indicate the jurors' opinions or be embarrassing to them, the names of the grand jurors asking the questions can be excised. Cf. United States v. Grunewald, 162 F. Supp. 621.\\nPlainly, then, no reason justifying secrecy of Jonas' relevant grand jury testimony appears. The Court's insistence on secrecy exalts the principle of secrecy for secrecy's sake in the face of obvious possible prejudice to the petitioners' defense against Jonas' seriously damaging testimony on the trial. Surely \"Justice requires no less,\" Jencks v. United States, 353 U.S. 657, 669, than that the defense be permitted every reasonable opportunity to impeach a government witness, and that a criminal conviction not be based on the testimony of untruthful or inaccurate witnesses. The interest of the United States in a criminal prosecution, it must be emphasized, \"is not that it shall win a case, but that justice shall be done.\" Berger v. United States, U. S. 78, 88.\\nObviously the impeachment of the Government's key witness on the basis of prior inconsistent or contradictory statements made under oath before a grand jury would have an important effect on a trial. Thus it has long been held that a defendant may have access to inconsistent grand jury testimony for use in cross-examination if he can somehow show that an inconsistency between the trial and grand jury testimony exists. United States v. Alper, 156 F.2d 222; Burton v. United States, 175 F.2d 960; Herzog v. United States, 226 F.2d 561; United States v. H. J. K. Theatre Corp., 236 F.2d 502. But in an analogous situation we have pointed *408 out the folly of requiring the defense to show inconsistency between the witness' trial testimony and his previous statements on the same subject matter before it can obtain access to those very statements. In Jencks v. United States, 353 U.S. 657, we said that it offers no protection to permit a defendant to obtain inconsistent statements to impeach a witness unless he may inspect statements to determine if in fact they are inconsistent with the trial testimony. We said in Jencks:\\n\"Requiring the accused first to show conflict between the reports and the testimony is actually to deny the accused evidence relevant and material to his defense. The occasion for determining a conflict cannot arise until after the witness has testified, and unless he admits conflict, as in Gordon, [Gordon v. United States, 344 U.S. 414] the accused is helpless to know or discover conflict without inspecting the reports. A requirement of a showing of conflict would be clearly incompatible with our standards for the administration of criminal justice in the federal courts and must therefore be rejected.\" 353 U.S., at 667-668.\\nThe considerations which moved us to lay down this principle as to prior statements of government witnesses made to government agents obviously apply with equal force to the grand jury testimony of a government witness. For the defense will rarely be able to lay a foundation for obtaining grand jury testimony by showing it is inconsistent with trial testimony unless it can inspect the grand jury testimony, and, apparently in recognition of this fact, the Court holds today that a preliminary showing of inconsistency by the defense would not be necessary in order for it to obtain access to relevant grand jury minutes. It is suggested by the Government, however, that rather than permit the defense to inspect the *409 relevant grand jury minutes for possible use on cross-examination, the trial judge should inspect them and turn over to the defense only those portions, if any, that the judge considers would be useful for purposes of impeachment. This procedure has sometimes been utilized in the past as a way to limit discovery of grand jury minutes. See United States v. Alper, 156 F.2d 222; United States v. Consolidated Laundries, 159 F. Supp. 860. But we pointed out in Jencks the serious disadvantages of such a procedure and expressly disapproved of it. We said:\\n\"Flat contradiction between the witness' testimony and the version of the events given in his reports is not the only test of inconsistency. The omission from the reports of facts related at the trial, or a contrast in emphasis upon the same facts, even a different order of treatment, are also relevant to the cross-examining process of testing the credibility of a witness' trial testimony.\\n.....\\n\". . . We hold . . . that the petitioner is entitled to inspect the reports to decide whether to use them in his defense. Because only the defense is adequately equipped to determine the effective use for purpose of discrediting the Government's witness and thereby furthering the accused's defense, the defense must initially be entitled to see them to determine what use may be made of them. Justice requires no less.\" 353 U.S., at 667-669.\\nFrom Jonas' own admission it appears that his grand jury testimony covered the subject matter of his trial testimony. The reasons for permitting the defense counsel rather than the trial judge to decide what parts of that testimony can effectively be used on cross-examination are certainly not less compelling than in regard to the FBI reports involved in Jencks. For grand jury *410 testimony is often lengthy and involved, and it will be extremely difficult for even the most able and experienced trial judge under the pressures of conducting a trial to pick out all of the grand jury testimony that would be useful in impeaching a witness. See United States v. Spangelet, 258 F.2d 338. His task should be completed when he has satisfied himself what part of the grand jury testimony covers the subject matter of the witness' testimony on the trial, and when he has given that part to the defense. Then the defense may utilize the grand jury testimony for impeachment purposes as it may deem advisable in its best interests, subject of course to the applicable rules of evidence.\\nI would reverse the Court of Appeals and order a new trial for failure of the trial judge to order the production of Jonas' relevant grand jury testimony.\\nNOTES\\n[*]  Together with No. 491, Galax Mirror Co., Inc., et al. v.

No obligation of secrecy may be imposed upon any person except in accordance with this rule.

This case, of course, concerns a demand for discovery of a particular witness' relevant testimony for use on cross-examination at trial in a criminal prosecution. The Court specifically stated in Procter &amp; Gamble: \"We do not reach in this case problems concerning the use of the grand jury transcript at the trial to impeach a witness, to refresh his recollection, to test his credibility and the like.

Decided June 22, 1959.[*] CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT. Leland Hazard argued the cause for petitioner in No. 489. With him on the brief were Cyrus v. Anderson and James B. Henry, Jr. *396 H. Graham Morison argued the cause for petitioners in No. 491. With him on the brief were Samuel K. Abrams and Robert M. Lichtman. Philip Elman argued the causes for the United States. On the brief were Solicitor General Rankin, Assistant Attorney General Hansen, Daniel M. Friedman, Richard A. Solomon, Samuel Karp and Ernest L. Folk III.  JUSTICE CLARK delivered the opinion of the Court. Petitioners stand convicted on a single-count indictment charging a conspiracy under § 1 of the Sherman Act. They contend that the trial judge erred in refusing to permit them to inspect the grand jury minutes covering the testimony before that body of a key government witness at the trial. The Court of Appeals affirmed the convictions, 260 F.2d 397. With reference to the present claim, it held that Rule 6 (e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure[1] committed the inspection or not of grand jury minutes to the sound discretion of the trial judge, *397 and that in this instance, no abuse of that discretion had been shown. We granted certiorari limited to the question posed by this ruling. 358 U.S. 917, 918. We conclude that in the circumstances of this case the trial court did not err in refusing to make Jonas' grand jury testimony available to petitioners for use in cross-examination. The indictment returned in the case named as defendants seven corporations, all manufacturers of mirrors, and three of their officers. However, only three of the corporations are petitioners here, along with one individual, J. A. Messer, Sr. The indictment charged a conspiracy to fix the price of plain plate glass mirrors sold in interstate commerce. It is not necessary for our purposes to detail the facts of this long trial, the record of which covers 860 pages. It is sufficient to say that the Government proved its case through 10 witnesses, the last of whom was Jonas. He was President of a large North Carolina mirror manufacturing company and had a reputation for independence in the industry. Although neither he nor his corporation was indicted, the latter was made a co-conspirator. The evidence indicates that the conspiracy was consummated at two meetings held on successive days during the week of the annual meeting of the Mirror Manufacturers Association in 1954 at Asheville, North Carolina. Jonas, not being a member of the Association, did not attend the convention. Talk at the convention regarding prices culminated in telephone calls by several representatives of mirror manufacturers to Jonas concerning his attitude on raising prices. On the day following these calls Jonas and three of the participants in the conspiracy met at an inn away from the convention headquarters and discussed \"prices.\" Within three days thereafter each of the manufacturers announced an identical price increase, which was approximately 10 percent. Jonas' testimony, of course, was confined to the telephone calls and the meeting at the inn *398 where the understanding was finalized. The Government admits that he was an \"important\" witness. However, proof of the conspiracy was overwhelming aside from Jonas' testimony. While he was the only witness who characterized the outcome of the meetings as an \"agreement\" on prices, no witness negatived this conclusion and the identical price lists that followed the meeting at the inn were little less than proof positive. After the conclusion of Jonas' testimony, defense counsel interrogated him as to the number of times he appeared and the subject of his testimony before the grand jury. Upon ascertaining that Jonas had testified three times on \"the same general subject matter,\" counsel moved for the delivery of the grand jury minutes. He stated that the petitioners had \"a right . . . to inspect the Grand Jury record of the testimony of this witness after he has completed his direct examination\" relating to \"the same general subject matter\" as his trial testimony.[2] As authority for \"the automatic delivery of Grand Jury transcripts\" under such circumstances counsel cited Jencks v. United States, 353 U.S. 657 (1957). As previously indicated, the motion was denied. It appears to us clear that Jencks v. United States, supra, is in nowise controlling here. It had nothing to do with grand jury proceedings and its language was not intended to encompass grand jury minutes. Likewise, it is equally clear that Congress intended to exclude those minutes from the operation of the so-called Jencks Act, 71 Stat. 595, 18 U.S. C. (Supp. V, 1958) § 3500.[3] Petitioners concede, as they must, that any disclosure of grand jury minutes is covered by Fed. Rules Crim. Proc. 6 (e) promulgated by this Court in 1946 after the *399 approval of Congress. In fact, the federal trial courts as well as the Courts of Appeals have been nearly unanimous in regarding disclosure as committed to the discretion of the trial judge.[4] Our cases announce the same principle,[5] and Rule 6 (e) is but declaratory of it.[6] As recently as last Term we characterized cases where grand jury minutes are used \"to impeach a witness, to refresh his recollection, to test his credibility and the like\" as instances of \"particularized need where the secrecy of the proceedings is lifted discretely and limitedly.\" United States v. Procter &amp; Gamble, 356 U.S. 677, 683 (1958). Petitioners argue, however, that the trial judge's discretion under Rule 6 (e) must be exercised in accordance with the rationale of Jencks; namely, upon a showing on cross-examination that a trial witness testified before the grand juryand nothing morethe defense has a \"right\" to the delivery to it of the witness' grand jury testimony. This conclusion, however, runs counter to \"a long-established policy\" of secrecy, United States v. Procter &amp; Gamble, supra, at 681, older than our Nation itself. The reasons therefor are manifold, id., at 682, and are compelling when viewed in the light of the history and modus operandi of the grand jury. Its establishment in the Constitution \"as the sole method for preferring charges in serious criminal cases\" indeed \"shows the high place it [holds] as an instrument of justice.\" Costello v. United States, 350 U.S. 359, 362 (1956). Ever since this action *400 by the Fathers, the American grand jury, like that of England, \"has convened as a body of laymen, free from technical rules, acting in secret, pledged to indict no one because of prejudice and to free no one because of special favor.\" Ibid. Indeed, indictments may be returned on hearsay, or for that matter, even on the knowledge of the grand jurors themselves. Id., at 362, 363. To make public any part of its proceedings would inevitably detract from its efficacy. Grand jurors would not act with that independence required of an accusatory and inquisitorial body. Moreover, not only would the participation of the jurors be curtailed, but testimony would be parsimonious if each witness knew that his testimony would soon be in the hands of the accused. Especially is this true in antitrust proceedings where fear of business reprisal might haunt both the grand juror and the witness. And this \"go slow\" sign would continue as realistically at the time of trial as theretofore. It does not follow, however, that grand jury minutes should never be made available to the defense. This Court has long held that there are occasions, see United States v. Procter &amp; Gamble, supra, at 683, when the trial judge may in the exercise of his discretion order the minutes of a grand jury witness produced for use on his cross-examination at trial. Certainly \"disclosure is wholly proper where the ends of justice require it.\" United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., supra, at 234. The burden, however, is on the defense to show that \"a particularized need\" exists for the minutes which outweighs the policy of secrecy. We have no such showing here. As we read the record the petitioners failed to show any need whatever for the testimony of the witness Jonas. They contended only that they had a \"right\" to the transcript because it dealt with subject matter generally covered at the trial. Petitioners indicate that the trial judge required a showing of contradiction *401 between Jonas' trial and grand jury testimony. Such a preliminary showing would not, of course, be necessary. While in a colloquy with counsel the judge did refer to such a requirement, we read his denial as being based on the breadth of petitioners' claim. Petitioners also claim error because the trial judge failed to examine the transcript himself for any inconsistencies. But we need not consider that problem because petitioners made no such request of the trial judge. The Court of Appeals apparently was of the view that even if the trial judge had been requested to examine the transcript he would not have been absolutely required to do so. It is contended here that the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has reached a contrary conclusion. United States v. Spangelet, 258 F.2d 338. Be that as it may, resolution of that question must await a case where the issue is presented by the record. The short of it is that in the present case the petitioners did not invoke the discretion of the trial judge, but asserted a supposed absolute right, a right which we hold they did not have. The judgment is therefore. Affirmed.  JUSTICE BRENNAN, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE,  JUSTICE BLACK and  JUSTICE DOUGLAS join, dissenting. In the words of the Court of Appeals, Jonas was the Government's \"principal prosecuting witness.\"[1] He was President of Lenoir Mirror Company, which company was *402 a participant in the alleged price-fixing conspiracy, but was not indicted. After Jonas testified on direct examination defense counsel asked for the production of his relevant grand jury testimony. The trial judge immediately made clear his intention not to grant the motion: \"Unless you can show some sound basis that contradicts between what happened in the Grand Jury room and his testimony before the Grand Jury and his testimony in this trial, I am not going to require the production of the Grand Jury records. It would be easy for any attorney to get access to the records of the Grand Jury by just such a motion as you are making here.\" Defense counsel protested, \"we are not attempting that. We want just a transcript of his testimony before the Grand Jury regarding the subjects to which he has testified on direct examination.\" (Emphasis supplied.) This request thus encompassed all of Jonas' grand jury testimony only if all of that testimony covered the subject matter of Jonas' trial testimony. The court replied, \"You have stated what you want to ask him and I am denying your right to do it.\" Plainly defense counsel were not asking to see the minutes of the entire grand jury proceedings, nor even of all of Jonas' testimony before the grand jury unless all of it was on the same subject matter as his trial testimony. Their motion was carefully limited to a request for so much of Jonas' grand jury testimony as \"covered the substance of his testimony on direct examination.\" This request that secrecy be \"lifted discretely and limitedly,\" United States v. Procter &amp; Gamble, 356 U.S. 677, 683, necessarily implied a request that the trial judge inspect the grand jury minutes and turn over to the defense only those parts dealing with Jonas' testimony on the same subject matter as his trial testimony. In this posture, then, the question for our decision is the narrow one whether the trial judge erred in denying the defense request for inspection of the grand jury testimony of a *403 key government witness which covered the subject matter of that witness' trial testimony.[2] I dissent from the Court's affirmance of the trial judge's ruling denying this carefully circumscribed request. Grand jury secrecy is, of course, not an end in itself. Grand jury secrecy is maintained to serve particular ends. But when secrecy will not serve those ends or when the advantages gained by secrecy are outweighed by a countervailing interest in disclosure, secrecy may and should be lifted, for to do so in such a circumstance would further the fair administration of criminal justice. See McNabb v. United States, 318 U.S. 332. It is true that secrecy is not to be lifted without a showing of good reason, but it is too late in the day to say, as the Court as a practical matter does here, that the Government may insist upon grand jury secrecy even when the possible prejudice to the accused in a criminal case is crystal clear and none of the reasons justifying secrecy is present. \"[A]fter the grand jury's functions are ended, disclosure is wholly proper where the ends of justice require it.\" United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 310 U.S. 150, 234. Thus grand jury minutes have been made available to a defendant accused of committing perjury before the grand jury so that he could adequately prepare his defense, United States v. Remington, 191 F.2d 246; United States v. Rose, 215 F.2d 617, and to a defendant who can show an inconsistency between the trial testimony and grand jury testimony of a government witness, United States v. Alper, 156 F.2d 222; Burton v. United States, 175 F.2d 960; Herzog v. United States, 226 F.2d 561; United States v. H. J. K. Theatre Corp., 236 F.2d 502. On occasion the Government itself has recognized the fairness of permitting the defense access to the grand jury testimony of *404 government witnesses even though it considered that it was not bound to do so, United States v. Grunewald, 162 F. Supp. 621. This Court has implied that grand jury minutes would be discoverable by a defendant in a civil antitrust suit instituted by the Government on a showing of \"particularized need,\" United States v. Procter &amp; Gamble, 356 U.S. 677, 683.[3] Nor can we overlook that the Government uses grand jury minutes to further its own interests in litigation. It is apparently standard practice for government attorneys to use grand jury minutes in preparing a case for trial, see United States v. Procter &amp; Gamble, 356 U.S. 677, 678, in refreshing the recollection of government witnesses at trial, see United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 310 U.S. 150, 233, and, when the need arises, in impeaching witnesses at trial, see United States v. Cotter, 60 F.2d 689. Of course, when the Government uses grand jury minutes at trial the defense is ordinarily entitled to inspect the relevant testimony in those minutes. United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 310 U.S. 150, 233; United States v. Cotter, 60 F.2d 689. Indeed, Rule 6 (e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal *405 Procedure itself recognizes that grand jury testimony is discoverable under appropriate circumstances.[4] The Court apparently agrees with the conclusion compelled by these precedents, for its opinion states that grand jury minutes are discoverable when \" `a particularized need' exists for the minutes which outweighs the policy of secrecy.\" But the Court pays only lip service to the principle in view of the result in this case. It is clear beyond question, I think, that the application of that principle to this case requires a holding that Jonas' grand jury testimony is discoverable to the limited extent sought. Since there are no valid considerations which militate in favor of grand jury secrecy in this case, simple justice requires that the petitioners be given access to the relevant portions of Jonas' grand jury testimony so that they have a fair opportunity to refute the Government's case. Essentially four reasons have been advanced as justification for grand jury secrecy.[5] (1) To prevent the accused from escaping before he is indicted and arrested or from tampering with the witnesses against him. (2) To prevent disclosure of derogatory information presented to the grand jury against an accused who has not been indicted. (3) To encourage complainants and witnesses to come before the grand jury and speak freely without fear that their testimony will be made public thereby subjecting them to possible discomfort or retaliation. (4) To encourage the grand jurors to engage in uninhibited investigation and deliberation by barring disclosure of their votes and comments during the proceedings. *406 None of these reasons dictates that Jonas' grand jury testimony, to the limited extent it is sought, should be kept secret. The Court, while making obeisance to \"a long-established policy\" of secrecy, makes no showing whatever how denial of Jonas' grand jury testimony serves any of the purposes justifying secrecy. Certainly disclosure at this stage of the proceedings would not enable the defendants to escape from custody or to tamper with the witness who has already testified against them on direct examination. Certainly, also, protection of an innocent accused who has not been indicted has no bearing on this case. Discovery has been sought only of Jonas' grand jury testimony on the same subject matter as his testimony at trial. This testimony will have condemned someone to whom he did not refer at trial only if he has concealed information at the trial, and this creates the very situation in which it is imperative that the defense have access to the grand jury testimony if we are to adhere to the standards we have set for ourselves to assure the fair administration of criminal justice in the federal courts. Similarly, disclosure of Jonas' relevant grand jury testimony could not produce the apprehended results of retaliation or discomfort which might induce a reluctance in others to testify before grand juries. Jonas has already taken the stand and testified freely in open court against the defendants. His testimony has been extremely damaging. Disclosure of his testimony before the grand jury is hardly likely to result in any embarrassment that his trial testimony has not already produced. \"If he tells the truth, and the truth is the same as he testified before the grand jury, the disclosure of the former testimony cannot possibly bring to him any harm . . . which his testimony on the open trial does not equally tend to produce.\" 8 Wigmore, Evidence (3d ed. 1940), § 2362, at 725. Witnesses before a grand jury necessarily know that once called by the Government to testify at trial they cannot *407 remain secret informants quite apart from whether their grand jury testimony is discoverable. Finally, the defense seeks nothing which would disclose the votes or opinions of any of the grand jurors involved in these proceedings. All that is sought is the relevant testimony of Jonas. If there are questions by grand jurors intertwined with Jonas' testimony disclosure of which would indicate the jurors' opinions or be embarrassing to them, the names of the grand jurors asking the questions can be excised. Cf. United States v. Grunewald, 162 F. Supp. 621. Plainly, then, no reason justifying secrecy of Jonas' relevant grand jury testimony appears. The Court's insistence on secrecy exalts the principle of secrecy for secrecy's sake in the face of obvious possible prejudice to the petitioners' defense against Jonas' seriously damaging testimony on the trial. Surely \"Justice requires no less,\" Jencks v. United States, 353 U.S. 657, 669, than that the defense be permitted every reasonable opportunity to impeach a government witness, and that a criminal conviction not be based on the testimony of untruthful or inaccurate witnesses. The interest of the United States in a criminal prosecution, it must be emphasized, \"is not that it shall win a case, but that justice shall be done.\" Berger v. United States, U. S. 78, 88. Obviously the impeachment of the Government's key witness on the basis of prior inconsistent or contradictory statements made under oath before a grand jury would have an important effect on a trial. Thus it has long been held that a defendant may have access to inconsistent grand jury testimony for use in cross-examination if he can somehow show that an inconsistency between the trial and grand jury testimony exists. United States v. Alper, 156 F.2d 222; Burton v. United States, 175 F.2d 960; Herzog v. United States, 226 F.2d 561; United States v. H. J. K. Theatre Corp., 236 F.2d 502. But in an analogous situation we have pointed *408 out the folly of requiring the defense to show inconsistency between the witness' trial testimony and his previous statements on the same subject matter before it can obtain access to those very statements. In Jencks v. United States, 353 U.S. 657, we said that it offers no protection to permit a defendant to obtain inconsistent statements to impeach a witness unless he may inspect statements to determine if in fact they are inconsistent with the trial testimony. We said in Jencks: \"Requiring the accused first to show conflict between the reports and the testimony is actually to deny the accused evidence relevant and material to his defense. The occasion for determining a conflict cannot arise until after the witness has testified, and unless he admits conflict, as in Gordon, [Gordon v. United States, 344 U.S. 414] the accused is helpless to know or discover conflict without inspecting the reports. A requirement of a showing of conflict would be clearly incompatible with our standards for the administration of criminal justice in the federal courts and must therefore be rejected.\" 353 U.S., at 667-668. The considerations which moved us to lay down this principle as to prior statements of government witnesses made to government agents obviously apply with equal force to the grand jury testimony of a government witness. For the defense will rarely be able to lay a foundation for obtaining grand jury testimony by showing it is inconsistent with trial testimony unless it can inspect the grand jury testimony, and, apparently in recognition of this fact, the Court holds today that a preliminary showing of inconsistency by the defense would not be necessary in order for it to obtain access to relevant grand jury minutes. It is suggested by the Government, however, that rather than permit the defense to inspect the *409 relevant grand jury minutes for possible use on cross-examination, the trial judge should inspect them and turn over to the defense only those portions, if any, that the judge considers would be useful for purposes of impeachment. This procedure has sometimes been utilized in the past as a way to limit discovery of grand jury minutes. See United States v. Alper, 156 F.2d 222; United States v. Consolidated Laundries, 159 F. Supp. 860. But we pointed out in Jencks the serious disadvantages of such a procedure and expressly disapproved of it. We said: \"Flat contradiction between the witness' testimony and the version of the events given in his reports is not the only test of inconsistency. The omission from the reports of facts related at the trial, or a contrast in emphasis upon the same facts, even a different order of treatment, are also relevant to the cross-examining process of testing the credibility of a witness' trial testimony. ..... \". . . We hold . . . that the petitioner is entitled to inspect the reports to decide whether to use them in his defense. Because only the defense is adequately equipped to determine the effective use for purpose of discrediting the Government's witness and thereby furthering the accused's defense, the defense must initially be entitled to see them to determine what use may be made of them. Justice no less.\" 353 U.S., at 667-669. From Jonas' own admission it appears that his grand jury testimony covered the subject matter of his trial testimony. The reasons for permitting the defense counsel rather than the trial judge to decide what parts of that testimony can effectively be used on cross-examination are certainly not less compelling than in regard to the FBI reports involved in Jencks. For grand jury *410 testimony is often lengthy and involved, and it will be extremely difficult for even the most able and experienced trial judge under the pressures of conducting a trial to pick out all of the grand jury testimony that would be useful in impeaching a witness. See United States v. Spangelet, 258 F.2d 338. His task should be completed when he has satisfied himself what part of the grand jury testimony covers the subject matter of the witness' testimony on the trial, and when he has given that part to the defense. Then the defense may utilize the grand jury testimony for impeachment purposes as it may deem advisable in its best interests, subject of course to the applicable rules of evidence. I would reverse the Court of Appeals and order a new trial for failure of the trial judge to order the production of Jonas' relevant grand jury testimony. NOTES [*] Together with No. 491, Galax Mirror Co., Inc., et al. v. United States, also on certiorari to the same Court, argued April 29, 1959. [1] \"Rule 6. The Grand Jury. ..... \"(e) Secrecy of Proceedings and Disclosure. Disclosure of matters occurring before the grand jury other than its deliberations and the vote of any juror may be made to the attorneys for the government for use in the performance of their duties. Otherwise a juror, attorney, interpreter or stenographer may disclose matters occurring before the grand jury only when so directed by the court preliminarily to or in connection with a judicial proceeding or when permitted by the court at the request of the defendant upon a showing that grounds may exist for a motion to dismiss the indictment because of matters occurring before the grand jury. No obligation of secrecy may be imposed upon any person except in accordance with this rule. The court may direct that an indictment shall be kept secret until the defendant is in custody or has given bail, and in that event the clerk shall seal the indictment and no person shall disclose the finding of the indictment except when necessary for the issuance and execution of a warrant or summons.\" [2] The fact that the trial testimony and that before the grand jury included the same \"subjects\" or related to \"the same general subject matter\" is not contested. [3] See S. Rep. No. 981, 85th Cong., 1st Sess.; 103 Cong. Rec. 15933. [4] E. g., United States v. Spangelet, 258 F.2d 338; United States v. Angelet, 255 F.2d 383; United States v.

And see United States v. Procter &amp; Gamble Co., 356 U.S. 677 (1958); United States v. Johnson, 319 U.S. 503, 513 (1943). [6] See Notes of the Advisory Committee on Rules, following Rule 6, Fed. Rules Crim. Proc. [1] Jonas was the only witness to testify that the defendants had actually agreed to a uniform price increase. Furthermore, his testimony was necessary to refute other testimony that the President of petitioner Galax Mirror Co., Inc., had stated that he would follow his pricing policy regardless of what the other manufacturers did. Jonas' testimony was also instrumental in connecting petitioner Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co. to the price-fixing agreement. [2] As the Court points out, discovery of grand jury minutes is not affected by the Jencks statute, 18 U.S. C. (Supp. V) § 3500. [3] United States v. Procter &amp; Gamble, upon which the Court relies, actually is authority for permitting discovery in this case. The Court in that case recognized that grand jury minutes were discoverable where the need outweighed the advantages of secrecy, but held that such was not the case in the circumstances because, unlike this case, Procter &amp; Gamble concerned a demand for a transcript of the entire grand jury proceedings to be used in pretrial preparation of a civil suit. This case, of course, concerns a demand for discovery of a particular witness' relevant testimony for use on cross-examination at trial in a criminal prosecution. The Court specifically stated in Procter &amp; Gamble: \"We do not reach in this case problems concerning the use of the grand jury transcript at the trial to impeach a witness, to refresh his recollection, to test his credibility and the like. Those are cases of particularized need where the secrecy of the proceedings is lifted discretely and limitedly.\" 356 U.S., at 683. [4] See United States v.

See § 8(d)(1) of the Small Business Act, as added by §7 of Pub. L. 87-305,75 Stat. 667, and as amended, 15 U. S. C. § 637(d)(1) (1994 ed., Supp. IV). To effectuate that policy, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA), Pub. L. 102-240, § 1003(b), 105 Stat. 1919, which is an appropriations measure for the Department of Transportation (DOT), seeks to direct 10 percent of the contracting funds expended on projects funded in whole or in part by the appropriated funds to transportation projects employing so-called disadvantaged business enterprises.\\n  \\n   1\\n  \\n  ISTEA § 1003(b)(1).\\n \\n\\n \\n   *218\\n   \\n  To qualify for that status, the small business must be certified as owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. DOT does not itself conduct certifications, but relies on certifications from two main sources: the Small Business Administration, which certifies businesses for all types of federal procurement programs, and state highway agencies, which certify them for purposes of federally assisted highway projects. The federal regulations governing these certification programs, see 13 CFR pt. 124 (1999) (Small Business Administration); 64 Fed. Reg. 5096-5148 (1999) (to be codified in 49 CFR pt. 26) (DOT for state highway agencies), require that the certifying entity\\n  \\n   presume\\n  \\n  to be socially disadvantaged persons who are black, Hispanic, Asian Pacific, Subcontinent Asian, Native Americans, or members of other groups designated from time to time by the Small Business Administration. See 13 CFR § 124.103(b); 64 Fed. Reg. 5136 (§26.67). State highway agencies must in addition presume that women are socially disadvantaged.\\n  \\n   Ibid.\\n  \\n  Small businesses owned and controlled by persons who are not members of the preferred groups may also be certified, but only if they can\\n  \\n   demonstrate\\n  \\n  social disadvantage. See 13 CFR § 124.103(c); 64 Fed. Reg. 5136-5137 (§ 26.67(d));\\n  \\n   id.,\\n  \\n  at 5147-5148 (pt. 26, subpt. D, App. E). Third parties, as well as DOT, may challenge findings of social disadvantage. See 13 CFR § 124.1017(a); 64 Fed. Reg. 5142 (§26.87).\\n \\n\\n  II\\n \\n\\n  In 1989, DOT awarded the prime contract for a federal highway project in Colorado to Mountain Gravel\\n  \\n   &amp;\\n  \\n  Construction Company. The contract included a Subcontractor Compensation Clause — which the Small Business Act requires all\\n   \\n   *219\\n   \\n  federal agencies to include in their prime contracts, see 15 U. S. C. § 637(d) — rewarding the prime contractor for subcontracting with disadvantaged business enterprises, see § 637(d)(4)(E). Petitioner, whose principal is a white man, submitted the low bid on a portion of the project, but Mountain Gravel awarded the subcontract to a company that had previously been certified by the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) as a disadvantaged business enterprise.\\n \\n\\n  Petitioner brought suit against various federal officials, alleging that the Subcontractor Compensation Clause, and in particular the race-based presumption that forms its foundation, violated petitioner’s Fifth Amendment right to equal protection. The Tenth Circuit, applying the so-called intermediate scrutiny approved in some of our cases involving classifications on a basis other than race, see\\n  \\n   Mississippi Univ. for Women\\n  \\n  v.\\n  \\n   Hogan,\\n  \\n  458 U. S. 718 (1982);\\n  \\n   Craig\\n  \\n  v.\\n  \\n   Boren,\\n  \\n  429 U.

Because DOT’S use of race-based measures should have been subjected to strict scrutiny, we reversed and remanded for the application of that standard.\\n  \\n   Adarand Constructors, Inc.\\n  \\n  v.\\n  \\n   Peña,\\n  \\n  515 U. S. 200, 237-239 (1995)\\n  \\n   (Adarand I).\\n  \\n\\n\\n  On remand, the District Court for the District of Colorado held that the clause and the presumption failed strict scrutiny because they were not narrowly tailored.\\n  \\n   Adarand Constructors, Inc.\\n  \\n  v.\\n  \\n   Peña,\\n  \\n  965 F. Supp. 1556 (1997)\\n  \\n   (Adarand II).\\n  \\n  Specifically, the court held the presumption that members of the enumerated racial groups are socially disadvantaged to be both overinelusive and underinclusive, because it includes members of those groups who are not disadvantaged and excludes members of other groups who are.\\n  \\n   Id.,\\n  \\n  at 1580. The District Court enjoined DOT from\\n   \\n   *220\\n   \\n  using the elause and its presumption.\\n  \\n   2\\n  \\n\\n   Id.,\\n  \\n  at 1584. Respondents appealed to the Tenth Circuit.\\n \\n\\n  Shortly thereafter, and while respondents’ appeal was still pending, petitioner filed a second suit in the District Court, this time naming as defendants certain Colorado officials, and challenging (on the same grounds) the State’s use of the federal guidelines in certifying disadvantaged business enterprises for federally assisted projects.\\n  \\n   Adarand Constructors, Inc.\\n  \\n  v.\\n  \\n   Romer,\\n  \\n  Civ. No. 97-K-1351 (June 26, 1997). Shortly after this suit was filed, however, Colorado altered its certification program in response to the District Court's decision in\\n  \\n   Adarand II.\\n  \\n  Specifically, the State did away with the presumption of social disadvantage for certain minorities and women, App. to Pet. for Cert. 109-111, and in its place substituted a requirement that all applicants certify on their own account that each of the firm’s majority owners “has experienced social disadvantage based upon the effects of racial, ethnic or gender discrimination,”\\n  \\n   id.,\\n  \\n  at 110. Colorado requires no further showing of social disadvantage by any applicant.\\n \\n\\n  A few days after Colorado amended its certification procedure, the District Court held a hearing on petitioner’s motion for a preliminary injunction in\\n  \\n   Romer.\\n  \\n  The District Court took judicial notice of its holding in\\n  \\n   Adarand II\\n  \\n  that the Federal Government had discriminated against petitioner’s owner “by the application of unconstitutional rules and regulations.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 136. As a result of that race-based discrimination, the District Court reasoned, petitioner likely was eligible for disadvantaged business status under Colorado’s system for certifying businesses for federally assisted projects — the system at issue in\\n  \\n   Romer.\\n  \\n  App. to Pet. for Cert. 137. The District Court therefore denied\\n   \\n   *221\\n   \\n  petitioner’s request for a preliminary injunction.\\n  \\n   Id.,\\n  \\n  at 138. Petitioner then requested and received disadvantaged business status from CDOT.\\n \\n\\n  Meanwhile, respondents’ appeal from the District Court’s decision in\\n  \\n   Adamnd II\\n  \\n  was pending before the Tenth Circuit. Upon learning that CDOT had given petitioner disadvantaged business status, the Tenth Circuit held that the cause of action was moot, and vacated the District Court’s judgment favorable to petitioner in\\n  \\n   Adarand II.\\n  \\n  169 F. 3d 1292, 1296-1297, 1299 (CA10 1999). Petitioner filed a petition for certiorari.\\n \\n\\n  Ill\\n \\n\\n  In dismissing the ease as moot, the Tenth Circuit relied on the language of the Subcontractor Compensation Clause, which provides that “[a] small business concern will be considered a [disadvantaged business enterprise] after it has been certified as such by . . . any State’s Department of Highways/Transportation.”\\n  \\n   Id.,\\n  \\n  at 1296. Because CDOT had certified petitioner as a disadvantaged business enterprise, the court reasoned, the language of the clause indicated that the Federal Government also had accepted petitioner’s certification for purposes of federal projects. As a result, petitioner could no longer demonstrate “ ‘an invasion of a legally protected interest’ that is sufficiently ‘concrete and particularized’ and ‘actual or imminent’” to establish standing.\\n  \\n   Arizonans for Official English\\n  \\n  v.\\n  \\n   Arizona,\\n  \\n  520 U. S. 43, 64 (1997) (quoting\\n  \\n   Lujan\\n  \\n  v.\\n  \\n   Defenders of Wildlife,\\n  \\n  504 U. S. 555, 560 (1992)). Because, the court continued, petitioner could not demonstrate such an invasion, its cause of action was\\n  \\n   moot.\\n  \\n  169 F. 3d, at 1296-1297.\\n \\n\\n  In so holding, the Tenth Circuit “confused mootness with standing,”\\n  \\n   Friends of Earth, Inc.\\n  \\n  v.\\n  \\n   Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc., ante,\\n  \\n  at 189, and as a result placed the burden of proof on the wrong party. If this case is moot, it is because the Federal Government has accepted CDOT’s\\n   \\n   *222\\n   \\n  certification of petitioner as a disadvantaged business enterprise, and has thereby eeased its offending conduct. Voluntary cessation of challenged conduct moots a ease, however, only if it is\\n  \\n   “absolutely\\n  \\n  clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur.”\\n  \\n   United States\\n  \\n  v.\\n  \\n   Concentrated Phosphate Export Assn., Inc.,\\n  \\n  393 U. S. 199, 203 (1968) (emphasis added). And the “ ‘heavy burden of persua[ding]’ the court that the challenged conduct cannot reasonably be expected to start up again\\n  \\n   lies with the party asserting mootness.” Friends of Earth, ante,\\n  \\n  at 189 (emphasis added) (quoting\\n  \\n   Concentrated Phosphate Export Assn., supra,\\n  \\n  at 203).\\n \\n\\n  Because respondents cannot satisfy this burden, the Tenth Circuit’s error was a crucial one. As common sense would suggest, and as the Tenth Circuit itself recognized, DOT accepts only “valid certification[s]” from state agencies. 169 F. 3d, at 1298. As respondents concede, however, see Brief in Opposition 13-14, n. 6, DOT has yet to approve — as it must—CDOT’s procedure for certifying disadvantaged business enterprises, see 64 Fed. Reg. 5129 (1999) (49 CFR § 26.21(b)(1)) (“[The State] must submit a [disadvantaged business enterprise] program conforming to this part by August 31, 1999 to the concerned operating administration”).\\n \\n\\n  DOT has promulgated regulations outlining the procedure state highway agencies must follow in certifying firms as disadvantaged business enterprises. See 64 Fed. Reg. 5096-5148 (pt. 26). As described earlier, those regulations require the agency to presume that “women, Black Americans, Hispanic Americans, Native Americans, Asian-Pacific Americans, Subcontinent Asian Americans, or other minorities found to be disadvantaged by the [Small Business Administration]” are socially disadvantaged.\\n  \\n   Id.,\\n  \\n  at 5136 (§ 26.67(a)(1)). Before individuals not members of those groups may be certified, the state agency must make individual determinations as to disadvantage. See\\n  \\n   id.,\\n  \\n  at 5136-5137 (§ 26.67(d)) (“In such a proceeding, the applicant firm\\n   \\n   *223\\n   \\n  has the burden of demonstrating to [the state highway-agency], by a preponderance of the evidence, that the individuals who own and control it are socially and economically disadvantaged”);\\n  \\n   id.,\\n  \\n  at 5147-5148 (pt. 26, subpt. D, App. E) (providing list of “elements” that highway agencies must consider in making individualized determinations of social disadvantage). CDOT’s new procedure under which petitioner was certified applies no presumption in favor of minority groups, and accepts without investigation a firm’s self-certification of entitlement to disadvantaged business status. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 109-111. Given the material differences (not to say incompatibility) between that procedure and the requirements of the DOT regulations, it is not at all clear that CDOT’s certification is a “valid certification,” and hence not at all clear that the Subcontractor Compensation Clause requires its acceptance.\\n \\n\\n  Before the Tenth Circuit, respondents took pains to “ex-presé] no opinion regarding the correctness of Colorado’s determination that [petitioner] is entitled to [disadvantaged business] status.” Motion by the Federal Appellants to Dismiss Appeal as Moot and to Vacate the District Court Judgment in No. 97-1304, p. 3, n. 2. Instead, they stated flatly that “in the event there is a third-party challenge to [petitioner’s] certification as a [disadvantaged business enterprise] and the decision on the challenge is appealed to DOT, DOT may review the decision to determine whether the certification was proper.”\\n  \\n   Id.,\\n  \\n  at 3-4, n. 2. In addition, DOT itself has the power to require States to initiate proceedings to withdraw a firm’s disadvantaged status if there is “reasonable cause to believe” that the firm “does not meet the eligibility criteria” set forth in the federal regulations. 64 Fed. Reg. 5142 (§ 26.87(e)(1)). Given the patent incompatibility of the certification with the federal regulations, it is far from clear that these possibilities will not become reality. Indeed, challenges to petitioner’s disadvantaged business status seem quite probable now that the Tenth Circuit, by\\n   \\n   *224\\n   \\n  vacating\\n  \\n   Adarand II,\\n  \\n  has eliminated the sole basis for petitioner’s certification in the first place.\\n \\n\\n  The Tenth Circuit dismissed these possibilities as insufficiently particular and concrete to grant standing and therefore “too conjectural and speculative to avoid a finding of mootness.” 169 F. 3d, at 1298 (internal quotation marks omitted). As we recently noted in\\n  \\n   Friends of the Earth,\\n  \\n  however, “[t]he plain lesson of [our precedents] is that there are circumstances in which the prospect that a defendant will engage in (or resume) harmful conduct may be too speculative to support standing, but not too speculative to overcome mootness.”\\n  \\n   Ante,\\n  \\n  at 190. Because, under the circumstances of this case, it is impossible to conclude that respondents have borne their burden of establishing that it is “absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur,”\\n  \\n   ante,\\n  \\n  at 189, petitioner’s cause of action remains alive.\\n \\n\\n\\n   * * *\\n  \\n\\n\\n  It is no small matter to deprive a litigant of the rewards of its efforts, particularly in a case that has been litigated up to this Court and back down again. Such action on grounds of mootness would be justified only if it were absolutely clear that the litigant no longer had any need of the judicial protection that it sought. Because that is not the case here, the petition for writ of certiorari is granted, the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\\n \\n\\n\\n   It is so ordered.\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n   1\\n  \\n\\n   Congress recently enacted the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, Pub. L. 105-178, Tit. I, § 1101(b), 112 Stat. 113, the successor appropriations measure to ISTEA. Although the new Act contains simi\\n    \\n    *218\\n    \\n   lar provisions, it is technically the provisions of ISTEA that apply to funding obligated in prior fiscal years but not yet expended.\\n  \\n\\n\\n   2\\n  \\n\\n   Before the Tenth Circuit, the parties disagreed as to whether the scope of the District Court’s remedial order was appropriate. In characterizing that order as we do here, we do not intend to take a position in that dispute.\\n  \\n</td>\n",

See § 8(d)(1) of the Small Business Act, as added by §7 of Pub. L. 87-305,75 Stat. 667, and as amended, 15 U. S. C. § 637(d)(1) (1994 ed., Supp. IV). To effectuate that policy, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA), Pub. L. 102-240, § 1003(b), 105 Stat. 1919, which is an appropriations measure for the Department of Transportation (DOT), seeks to direct 10 percent of the contracting funds expended on projects funded in whole or in part by the appropriated funds to transportation projects employing so-called disadvantaged business enterprises. 1 ISTEA § 1003(b)(1). *218 To qualify for that status, the small business must be certified as owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. DOT does not itself conduct certifications, but relies on certifications from two main sources: the Small Business Administration, which certifies businesses for all types of federal procurement programs, and state highway agencies, which certify them for purposes of federally assisted highway projects. The federal regulations governing these certification programs, see 13 CFR pt. 124 (1999) (Small Business Administration); 64 Fed. Reg. 5096-5148 (1999) (to be codified in 49 CFR pt. 26) (DOT for state highway agencies), require that the certifying entity presume to be socially disadvantaged persons who are black, Hispanic, Asian Pacific, Subcontinent Asian, Native Americans, or members of other groups designated from time to time by the Small Business Administration. See 13 CFR § 124.103(b); 64 Fed. Reg. 5136 (§26.67). State highway agencies must in addition presume that women are socially disadvantaged. Ibid. Small businesses owned and controlled by persons who are not members of the preferred groups may also be certified, but only if they can demonstrate social disadvantage. See 13 CFR § 124.103(c); 64 Fed. Reg. 5136-5137 (§ 26.67(d)); id., at 5147-5148 (pt. 26, subpt. D, App. E). Third parties, as well as DOT, may challenge findings of social disadvantage. See 13 CFR § 124.1017(a); 64 Fed. Reg. 5142 (§26.87). II In 1989, DOT awarded the prime contract for a federal highway project in Colorado to Mountain Gravel &amp; Construction Company. The contract included a Subcontractor Compensation Clause — which the Small Business Act requires all *219 federal agencies to include in their prime contracts, see 15 U. S. C. § 637(d) — rewarding the prime contractor for subcontracting with disadvantaged business enterprises, see § 637(d)(4)(E). Petitioner, whose principal is a white man, submitted the low bid on a portion of the project, but Mountain Gravel awarded the subcontract to a company that had previously been certified by the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) as a disadvantaged business enterprise. Petitioner brought suit against various federal officials, alleging that the Subcontractor Compensation Clause, and in particular the race-based presumption that forms its foundation, violated petitioner’s Fifth Amendment right to equal protection. The Tenth Circuit, applying the so-called intermediate scrutiny approved in some of our cases involving classifications on a basis other than race, see Mississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan, 458 U. S. 718 (1982); Craig v. Boren, 429 U. S. 190 (1976), upheld the use of the clause and the presumption. Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Peña, 16 F. 3d 1537 (1994). Because DOT’S use of race-based measures should have been subjected to strict scrutiny, we reversed and remanded for the application of that standard. Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Peña, 515 U. S. 200, 237-239 (1995) (Adarand I). On remand, the District Court for the District of Colorado held that the clause and the presumption failed strict scrutiny because they were not narrowly tailored. Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Peña, 965 F. Supp. 1556 (1997) (Adarand II). Specifically, the court held the presumption that members of the enumerated racial groups are socially disadvantaged to be both overinelusive and underinclusive, because it includes members of those groups who are not disadvantaged and excludes members of other groups who are. Id., at 1580. The District Court enjoined DOT from *220 using the elause and its presumption. 2 Id., at 1584. Respondents appealed to the Tenth Circuit. Shortly thereafter, and while respondents’ appeal was still pending, petitioner filed a second suit in the District Court, this time naming as defendants certain Colorado officials, and challenging (on the same grounds) the State’s use of the federal guidelines in certifying disadvantaged business enterprises for federally assisted projects. Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Romer, Civ. No. 97-K-1351 (June 26, 1997). Shortly after this suit was filed, however, Colorado altered its certification program in response to the District Court's decision in Adarand II. Specifically, the State did away with the presumption of social disadvantage for certain minorities and women, App. to Pet. for Cert. 109-111, and in its place substituted a requirement that all applicants certify on their own account that each of the firm’s majority owners “has experienced social disadvantage based upon the effects of racial, ethnic or gender discrimination,” id., at 110. Colorado requires no further showing of social disadvantage by any applicant. A few days after Colorado amended its certification procedure, the District Court held a hearing on petitioner’s motion for a preliminary injunction in Romer. The District Court took judicial notice of its holding in Adarand II that the Federal Government had discriminated against petitioner’s owner “by the application of unconstitutional rules and regulations.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 136. As a result of that race-based discrimination, the District Court reasoned, petitioner likely was eligible for disadvantaged business status under Colorado’s system for certifying businesses for federally assisted projects — the system at issue in Romer. App. to Pet. for Cert. 137. The District Court therefore denied *221 petitioner’s request for a preliminary injunction. Id., at 138. Petitioner then requested and received disadvantaged business status from CDOT. Meanwhile, respondents’ appeal from the District Court’s decision in Adamnd II was pending before the Tenth Circuit. Upon learning that CDOT had given petitioner disadvantaged business status, the Tenth Circuit held that the cause of action was moot, and vacated the District Court’s judgment favorable to petitioner in Adarand II. 169 F. 3d 1292, 1296-1297, 1299 (CA10 1999). Petitioner filed a petition for certiorari. Ill In dismissing the ease as moot, the Tenth Circuit relied on the language of the Subcontractor Compensation Clause, which provides that “[a] small business concern will be considered a [disadvantaged business enterprise] after it has been certified as such by . . . any State’s Department of Highways/Transportation.” Id., at 1296. Because CDOT had certified petitioner as a disadvantaged business enterprise, the court reasoned, the language of the clause indicated that the Federal Government also had accepted petitioner’s certification for purposes of federal projects. As a result, petitioner could no longer demonstrate “ ‘an invasion of a legally protected interest’ that is sufficiently ‘concrete and particularized’ and ‘actual or imminent’” to establish standing. Arizonans for Official English v. Arizona, 520 U. S. 43, 64 (1997) (quoting Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555, 560 (1992)). Because, the court continued, petitioner could not demonstrate such an invasion, its cause of action was moot. 169 F. 3d, at 1296-1297. In so holding, the Tenth Circuit “confused mootness with standing,” Friends of Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc., ante, at 189, and as a result placed the burden of proof on the wrong party. If this case is moot, it is because the Federal Government has accepted CDOT’s *222 certification of petitioner as a disadvantaged business enterprise, and has thereby eeased its offending conduct. Voluntary cessation of challenged conduct moots a ease, however, only if it is “absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur.” United States v. Concentrated Phosphate Export Assn., Inc., 393 U. S. 199, 203 (1968) (emphasis added). And the “ ‘heavy burden of persua[ding]’ the court that the challenged conduct cannot reasonably be expected to start up again lies with the party asserting mootness.” Friends of Earth, ante, at 189 (emphasis added) (quoting Concentrated Phosphate Export Assn., supra, at 203). Because respondents cannot satisfy this burden, the Tenth Circuit’s error was a crucial one. As common sense would suggest, and as the Tenth Circuit itself recognized, DOT accepts only “valid certification[s]” from state agencies. 169 F. 3d, at 1298. As respondents concede, however, see Brief in Opposition 13-14, n. 6, DOT has yet to approve — as it must—CDOT’s procedure for certifying disadvantaged business enterprises, see 64 Fed. Reg. 5129 (1999) (49 CFR § 26.21(b)(1)) (“[The State] must submit a [disadvantaged business enterprise] program conforming to this part by August 31, 1999 to the concerned operating administration”). DOT has promulgated regulations outlining the procedure state highway agencies must follow in certifying firms as disadvantaged business enterprises. See 64 Fed. Reg. 5096-5148 (pt. 26). As described earlier, those regulations require the agency to presume that “women, Black Americans, Hispanic Americans, Native Americans, Asian-Pacific Americans, Subcontinent Asian Americans, or other minorities found to be disadvantaged by the [Small Business Administration]” are socially disadvantaged. Id., at 5136 (§ 26.67(a)(1)). Before individuals not members of those groups may be certified, the state agency must make individual determinations as to disadvantage. See id., at 5136-5137 (§ 26.67(d)) (“In such a proceeding, the applicant firm *223 has the burden of demonstrating to [the state highway-agency], by a preponderance of the evidence, that the individuals who own and control it are socially and economically disadvantaged”); id., at 5147-5148 (pt. 26, subpt. D, App. E) (providing list of “elements” that highway agencies must consider in making individualized determinations of social disadvantage). CDOT’s new procedure under which petitioner was certified applies no presumption in favor of minority groups, and accepts without investigation a firm’s self-certification of entitlement to disadvantaged business status. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 109-111. Given the material differences (not to say incompatibility) between that procedure and the requirements of the DOT regulations, it is not at all clear that CDOT’s certification is a “valid certification,” and hence not at all clear that the Subcontractor Compensation Clause requires its acceptance. Before the Tenth Circuit, respondents took pains to “ex-presé] no opinion regarding the correctness of Colorado’s determination that [petitioner] is entitled to [disadvantaged business] status.” Motion by the Federal Appellants to Dismiss Appeal as Moot and to Vacate the District Court Judgment in No. 97-1304, p. 3, n. 2. Instead, they stated flatly that “in the event there is a third-party challenge to [petitioner’s] certification as a [disadvantaged business enterprise] and the decision on the challenge is appealed to DOT, DOT may review the decision to determine whether the certification was proper.” Id., at 3-4, n. 2. In addition, DOT itself has the power to require States to initiate proceedings to withdraw a firm’s disadvantaged status if there is “reasonable cause to believe” that the firm “does not meet the eligibility criteria” set forth in the federal regulations. 64 Fed. Reg. 5142 (§ 26.87(e)(1)). Given the patent incompatibility of the certification with the federal regulations, it is far from clear that these possibilities will not become reality. Indeed, challenges to petitioner’s disadvantaged business status seem quite probable now that the Tenth Circuit, by *224 vacating Adarand II, has eliminated the sole basis for petitioner’s certification in the first place. The Tenth Circuit dismissed these possibilities as insufficiently particular and concrete to grant standing and therefore “too conjectural and speculative to avoid a finding of mootness.” 169 F. 3d, at 1298 (internal quotation marks omitted). As we recently noted in Friends of the Earth, however, “[t]he plain lesson of [our precedents] is that there are circumstances in which the prospect that a defendant will engage in (or resume) harmful conduct may be too speculative to support standing, but not too speculative to overcome mootness.” Ante, at 190. Because, under the circumstances of this case, it is impossible to conclude that respondents have borne their burden of establishing that it is “absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur,” ante, at 189, petitioner’s cause of action remains alive. * * * It is no small matter to deprive a litigant of the rewards of its efforts, particularly in a case that has been litigated up to this Court and back down again. Such action on grounds of mootness would be justified only if it were absolutely clear that the litigant no longer had any need of the judicial protection that it sought. Because that is not the case here, the petition for writ of certiorari is granted, the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. It is so ordered. 1 Congress recently enacted the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, Pub. L. 105-178, Tit. I, § 1101(b), 112 Stat. 113, the successor appropriations measure to ISTEA. Although the new Act contains simi *218 lar provisions, it is technically the provisions of ISTEA that apply to funding obligated in prior fiscal years but not yet expended. 2 Before the Tenth Circuit, the parties disagreed as to whether the scope of the District Court’s remedial order was appropriate. In characterizing that order as we do here, we do not intend to take a position in that dispute.</td>\n",

Plan participants may direct their contributions into any of a number of investment options, including an \"employee stock ownership plan\" (ESOP), which invests its funds primarily in Fifth Third stock. Respondents, former Fifth Third employees and ESOP participants, filed this lawsuit against petitioners, Fifth Third and several of its officers who are alleged to be fiduciaries of the ESOP. The complaint alleges that petitioners breached the fiduciary duty of prudence imposed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA),\\n  \\n   29 U.S.C. § 1104\\n  \\n  (a)(1)(B). Specifically, the complaint alleges that petitioners should have known-on the basis of both publicly available information and inside information available to petitioners because they were Fifth Third officers-that Fifth Third stock was overpriced and excessively risky. It further alleges that a prudent fiduciary in petitioners' position would have responded to this information by selling off the ESOP's holdings of Fifth Third stock, refraining from purchasing more Fifth Third stock, or disclosing the negative inside information so that the market could correct the stock's price downward. According to the complaint, petitioners did none of these things, and the price of Fifth Third stock ultimately fell, reducing respondents' retirement savings. The District Court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim, but the Sixth Circuit reversed. It concluded that ESOP fiduciaries are entitled to a\\n   \"presumption of prudence\" that does not apply to other ERISA fiduciaries but that the presumption is an evidentiary one and therefore does not apply at the pleading stage. The court went on to hold that the complaint stated a claim for breach of fiduciary duty.\\n \\n\\n\\n   Held\\n  \\n  :\\n \\n\\n  1. ESOP fiduciaries are not entitled to any special presumption of prudence. Rather, they are subject to the same duty of prudence that applies to ERISA fiduciaries in general, § 1104(a)(1)(B), except that they need not diversify the fund's assets, § 1104(a)(2). This conclusion follows from the relevant provisions of ERISA. Section 1104(a)(1)(B) \"imposes a 'prudent person' standard by which to measure fiduciaries' investment decisions and disposition of assets.\"\\n  \\n   Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Russell,\\n  \\n\\n   473 U.S. 134\\n  \\n  , 143, n. 10,\\n  \\n   105 S.Ct. 3085\\n  \\n  ,\\n  \\n   87 L.Ed.2d 96\\n  \\n  .Section 1104(a)(1)(C) requires ERISA fiduciaries to diversify plan assets. And § 1104(a)(2) establishes the extent to which those duties are loosened in the ESOP context by providing that \"the diversification requirement of [§ 1104(a)(1)(C) ] and the prudence requirement (only to the extent that it requires diversification) of [§ 1104(a)(1)(B) ] [are] not violated by acquisition or holding of [employer stock].\" Section 1104(a)(2) makes no reference to a special \"presumption\" in favor of ESOP fiduciaries and does not require plaintiffs to allege that the employer was,\\n  \\n   e.g.,\\n  \\n  on the \"brink of collapse.\" It simply modifies the duties imposed by § 1104(a)(1) in a precisely delineated way. Thus, aside from the fact that ESOP fiduciaries are not liable for losses that result from a failure to diversify, they are subject to the duty of prudence like other ERISA fiduciaries. Pp. 2465 - 2471.\\n \\n\\n  2. On remand, the Sixth Circuit should reconsider whether the complaint states a claim by applying the pleading standard as discussed in\\n  \\n   Ashcroft v. Iqbal,\\n  \\n\\n   556 U.S. 662\\n  \\n  , 677-680,\\n  \\n   129 S.Ct. 1937\\n  \\n  ,\\n  \\n   173 L.Ed.2d 868\\n  \\n  , and\\n  \\n   Bell Atlantic Corp. v.

Pp. 2471 - 2473.\\n \\n\\n  (a) Where a stock is publicly traded, allegations that a fiduciary should have recognized on the basis of publicly available information that the market was overvaluing or undervaluing the stock are generally implausible and thus insufficient to state a claim under\\n  \\n   Twombly\\n  \\n  and\\n  \\n   Iqbal\\n  \\n  . Pp. 2471 - 2472.\\n \\n\\n  (b) To state a claim for breach of the duty of prudence, a complaint must plausibly allege an alternative action that the defendant could have taken, that would have been legal, and that a prudent fiduciary in the same circumstances would not have viewed as more likely to harm the fund than to help it. Where the complaint alleges that a fiduciary was imprudent in failing to act on the basis of inside information, the analysis is informed by the following points. First, ERISA's duty of prudence never requires a fiduciary to break the law, and so a fiduciary cannot be imprudent for failing to buy or sell stock in violation of the insider trading laws. Second, where a complaint faults fiduciaries for failing to decide, based on negative inside information, to refrain from making additional stock purchases or for failing to publicly disclose that information so that the stock would no longer be overvalued, courts should consider the extent to which imposing an ERISA-based obligation either to refrain from making a planned trade or to disclose inside information to the public could conflict with the complex insider trading and corporate disclosure requirements set forth by the federal securities laws or with the objectives of those laws. Third, courts confronted with such claims should consider whether the complaint\\n   has plausibly alleged that a prudent fiduciary in the defendant's position could not have concluded that stopping purchases or publicly disclosing negative information would do more harm than good to the fund by causing a drop in the stock price and a concomitant drop in the value of the stock already held by the fund.

This case focuses upon that duty of prudence as applied to the fiduciary of an \"employee stock ownership plan\" (ESOP), a type of pension plan that invests primarily in the stock of the company that employs the plan participants.\\n \\n\\n  We consider whether, when an ESOP fiduciary's decision to buy or hold the employer's stock is challenged in court, the fiduciary is entitled to a defense-friendly standard that the lower courts have called a \"presumption of prudence.\" The Courts of Appeals that have considered the question have held that such a presumption does apply, with the presumption generally defined as a requirement that the plaintiff make a showing that would not be required in an ordinary duty-of-prudence case, such as that the employer was on the brink of collapse.\\n \\n\\n  We hold that no such presumption applies. Instead, ESOP fiduciaries are subject to the same duty of prudence that applies to ERISA fiduciaries in general, except that they need not diversify the fund's assets. § 1104(a)(2).\\n \\n\\n\\n   I\\n  \\n\\n\\n  Petitioner Fifth Third Bancorp, a large financial services firm, maintains for its employees a defined-contribution retirement savings plan. Employees may choose to contribute a portion of their compensation to the Plan as retirement savings, and Fifth Third provides matching contributions of up to 4% of an employee's compensation. The Plan's assets are invested in 20 separate funds, including\\n    mutual funds and an ESOP. Plan participants can allocate their contributions among the funds however they like; Fifth Third's matching contributions, on the other hand, are always invested initially in the ESOP, though the participant can then choose to move them to another fund. The Plan requires the ESOP's funds to be \"invested primarily in shares of common stock of Fifth Third.\" App. 350.\\n \\n\\n  Respondents, who are former Fifth Third employees and ESOP participants, filed this putative class action in Federal District Court in Ohio. They claim that petitioners, Fifth Third and various Fifth Third officers, were fiduciaries of the Plan and violated the duties of loyalty and prudence imposed by ERISA. See §§ 1109(a), 1132(a)(2). We limit our review to the duty-of-prudence claims.\\n \\n\\n  The complaint alleges that by July 2007, the fiduciaries knew or should have known that Fifth Third's stock was overvalued and excessively risky for two separate reasons. First, publicly available information such as newspaper articles provided early warning signs that subprime lending, which formed a large part of Fifth Third's business, would soon leave creditors high and dry as the housing market collapsed and subprime borrowers became unable to pay off their mortgages. Second, nonpublic information (which petitioners knew because they were Fifth Third insiders) indicated that Fifth Third officers had deceived the market by making material misstatements about the company's financial prospects. Those misstatements led the market to overvalue Fifth Third stock-the ESOP's primary investment-and so petitioners, using the participants' money, were consequently paying more for that stock than it was worth.\\n \\n\\n  The complaint further alleges that a prudent fiduciary in petitioners' position would have responded to this information in one or more of the following ways: (1) by selling the ESOP's holdings of Fifth Third stock before the value of those holdings declined, (2) by refraining from purchasing any more Fifth Third stock, (3) by canceling the Plan's ESOP option, and (4) by disclosing the inside information so that the market would adjust its valuation of Fifth Third stock downward and the ESOP would no longer be overpaying for it.\\n \\n\\n  Rather than follow any of these courses of action, petitioners continued to hold and buy Fifth Third stock. Then the market crashed, and Fifth Third's stock price fell by 74% between July 2007 and September 2009, when the complaint was filed. Since the ESOP's funds were invested primarily in Fifth Third stock, this fall in price eliminated a large part of the retirement savings that the participants had invested in the ESOP. (The stock has since made a partial recovery to around half of its July 2007 price.)\\n \\n\\n  The District Court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim.\\n  \\n   757 F.Supp.2d 753\\n  \\n  (S.D.Ohio 2010). The court began from the premise that where a lawsuit challenges ESOP fiduciaries' investment decisions, \"the plan fiduciaries start with a presumption that their 'decision to remain invested in employer securities was reasonable.' \"\\n  \\n\\n    Id.,\\n   \\n\\n\\n   at 758\\n  \\n  (quoting\\n  \\n   Kuper v. Iovenko,\\n  \\n\\n   66 F.3d 1447\\n  \\n  , 1459 (C.A.6 1995)). The court next held that this rule is applicable at the pleading stage and then concluded that the complaint's allegations were insufficient to overcome it.\\n  \\n   757 F.Supp.2d, at 758-759, 760-762\\n  \\n  .\\n \\n\\n  The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed.\\n  \\n   692 F.3d 410\\n  \\n  (2012). Although it agreed that ESOP fiduciaries are entitled to a presumption of prudence, it took the view that the presumption is evidentiary only and therefore does not apply at the pleading stage.\\n  \\n\\n    Id.,\\n   \\n\\n\\n   at 418-419\\n  \\n  .\\n \\n\\n  Thus, the Sixth Circuit simply asked whether the allegations in the complaint were sufficient to state a claim for breach of fiduciary duty.\\n  \\n\\n    Id.,\\n   \\n\\n\\n   at 419\\n  \\n  . It held that they were.\\n  \\n\\n    Id.,\\n   \\n\\n\\n   at 419-420\\n  \\n  .\\n \\n\\n  In light of differences among the Courts of Appeals as to the nature of the presumption of prudence applicable to ESOP fiduciaries, we granted the fiduciaries' petition for certiorari.

On the one hand, ERISA itself subjects pension plan fiduciaries to a duty of prudence. In a section titled \"Fiduciary duties,\" it says:\\n \\n\\n  \"(a)\\n  \\n   Prudent man standard of care\\n  \\n\\n\\n  \"(1) Subject to sections 1103(c) and (d), 1342, and 1344 of this title, a fiduciary shall discharge his duties with respect to a plan solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries and-\\n \\n\\n  \"(A) for the exclusive purpose of:\\n \\n\\n  \"(i) providing benefits to participants and their beneficiaries; and\\n \\n\\n  \"(ii) defraying reasonable expenses of administering the plan;\\n \\n\\n  \"(B) with the care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing that a prudent man acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character and with like aims;\\n \\n\\n  \"(C) by diversifying the investments of the plan so as to minimize the risk of large losses, unless under the circumstances it is clearly prudent not to do so; and\\n \\n\\n  \"(D) in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the plan insofar as such documents and instruments are consistent with the provisions of this subchapter and subchapter III of this chapter.\" § 1104.\\n \\n\\n  See also\\n  \\n   Central States, Southeast &amp; Southwest Areas Pension Fund v. Central Transport, Inc.,\\n  \\n\\n   472 U.S. 559\\n  \\n  , 570,\\n  \\n   105 S.Ct. 2833\\n  \\n  ,\\n  \\n   86 L.Ed.2d 447\\n  \\n  (1985) (Section 1104(a)(1) imposes \"strict standards of trustee conduct ... derived from the common law of trusts-most prominently, a standard of loyalty and a standard of care\").\\n \\n\\n  On the other hand, Congress recognizes that ESOPs are \"designed to invest primarily in\" the stock of the participants' employer, § 1107(d)(6)(A), meaning that they are\\n  \\n   not\\n  \\n  prudently diversified. And it has written into law its \"interest in encouraging\" their use. One statutory provision says:\\n \\n\\n  \"Intent of Congress Concerning Employee Stock Ownership Plans.-The Congress, in a series of laws [including ERISA] has made clear its interest in encouraging [ESOPs] as a bold and innovative method of strengthening the\\n    free private enterprise system which will solve the dual problems of securing capital funds for necessary capital growth and of bringing about stock ownership by all corporate employees. The Congress is deeply concerned that the objectives sought by this series of laws will be made unattainable by regulations and rulings which treat [ESOPs] as conventional retirement plans, which reduce the freedom of the employee trusts and employers to take the necessary steps to implement the plans, and which otherwise block the establishment and success of these plans.\" Tax Reform Act of 1976, § 803(h),\\n  \\n   90 Stat. 1590\\n  \\n  .\\n \\n\\n  In addition, and in keeping with this statement of intent, Congress has given ESOP fiduciaries a statutory exemption from some of the duties imposed on ERISA fiduciaries. ERISA specifically provides that, in the case of ESOPs and other eligible individual account plans,\\n \\n\\n  \"the diversification requirement of [§ 1104(a)(1)(C) ] and the prudence requirement (only to the extent that it requires diversification) of [§ 1104(a)(1)(B) ] [are] not violated by acquisition or holding of [employer stock].\" § 1104(a)(2).\\n \\n\\n  Thus, an ESOP fiduciary is not obliged under § 1104(a)(1)(C) to \"diversif[y] the investments of the plan so as to minimize the risk of large losses\" or under § 1104(a)(1)(B) to act \"with the care, skill, prudence, and diligence\" of a \"prudent man\" insofar as that duty \"requires diversification.\"\\n \\n\\n\\n   B\\n  \\n\\n\\n  Several Courts of Appeals have gone beyond ERISA's express provision that ESOP fiduciaries need not diversify by giving ESOP fiduciaries a \"presumption of prudence\" when their decisions to hold or buy employer stock are challenged as imprudent. Thus, the Third Circuit has held that \"an ESOP fiduciary who invests the [ESOP's] assets in employer stock is entitled to a presumption that it acted consistently with ERISA\" in doing so.\\n  \\n   Moench v. Robertson,\\n  \\n\\n   62 F.3d 553\\n  \\n  , 571 (1995). The Ninth Circuit has said that to \"overcome the presumption of prudent investment, plaintiffs must ... make allegations that clearly implicate the company's viability as an ongoing concern or show a precipitous decline in the employer's stock ... combined with evidence that the company is on the brink of collapse or is undergoing serious mismanagement.\"\\n  \\n   Quan v. Computer Sciences Corp.,\\n  \\n\\n   623 F.3d 870\\n  \\n  , 882 (2010) (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted). And the Seventh Circuit has described the presumption as requiring plaintiffs to \"allege and ultimately prove that the company faced 'impending collapse' or 'dire circumstances' that could not have been foreseen by the founder of the plan.\"\\n  \\n   White v. Marshall &amp; Ilsley Corp.,\\n  \\n\\n   714 F.3d 980\\n  \\n  , 989 (2013).\\n \\n\\n  The Sixth Circuit agreed that some sort of presumption favoring an ESOP fiduciary's purchase of employer stock is appropriate. But it held that this presumption is an evidentiary rule that does not apply at the pleading stage. It further held that, to overcome the presumption, a plaintiff need not show that the employer was on the \"brink of collapse\" or the like. Rather, the plaintiff need only show that \" 'a prudent fiduciary acting under similar circumstances would have made a different investment decision.' \"\\n  \\n   692 F.3d, at 418\\n  \\n  (quoting\\n  \\n   Kuper,\\n  \\n\\n   66 F.3d, at 1459\\n  \\n  ).\\n \\n\\n  Petitioners argue that the lower courts are right to apply a presumption of prudence, that it should apply from the pleading stage onward, and that the presumption should be strongly in favor of ESOP fiduciaries' purchasing and holding of employer stock.\\n \\n\\n  In particular, petitioners propose a rule that a challenge to an ESOP fiduciary's decision to hold or buy company stock \"cannot prevail unless extraordinary circumstances, such as a serious threat to the employer's viability, mean that continued investment would substantially impair the purpose of the plan.\" Brief for Petitioners 16. In petitioners' view, the \"purpose of the plan,\" in the case of an ESOP, is promoting employee ownership of the employer's stock over the long term. And, petitioners assert, that purpose is \"substantially impair[ed]\"-rendering continued investment imprudent-only when \"a serious threat to the employer's viability\" makes it likely that the employer will go out of business. This is because the goal of employee ownership will be substantially impaired only if the employer goes out of business, leaving the employees with no company to own.\\n  \\n   Id.,\\n  \\n  at 24.\\n \\n\\n  We must decide whether ERISA contains some such presumption.\\n \\n\\n\\n   III\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n   A\\n  \\n\\n\\n  In our view, the law does not create a special presumption favoring ESOP fiduciaries. Rather, the same standard of prudence applies to all ERISA fiduciaries, including ESOP fiduciaries, except that an ESOP fiduciary is under no duty to diversify the ESOP's holdings. This conclusion follows from the pertinent provisions of ERISA, which are set forth above.\\n \\n\\n  Section 1104(a)(1)(B) \"imposes a 'prudent person' standard by which to measure fiduciaries' investment decisions and disposition of assets.\"\\n  \\n   Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Russell,\\n  \\n\\n   473 U.S. 134\\n  \\n  , 143, n. 10,\\n  \\n   105 S.Ct. 3085\\n  \\n  ,\\n  \\n   87 L.Ed.2d 96\\n  \\n  (1985). Section 1104(a)(1)(C) requires ERISA fiduciaries to diversify plan assets. And § 1104(a)(2) establishes the extent to which those duties are loosened in the ESOP context to ensure that employers are permitted and encouraged to offer ESOPs. Section 1104(a)(2) makes no reference to a special \"presumption\" in favor of ESOP fiduciaries. It does not require plaintiffs to allege that the employer was on the \"brink of collapse,\" under \"extraordinary circumstances,\" or the like. Instead, § 1104(a)(2) simply modifies the duties imposed by § 1104(a)(1) in a precisely delineated way: It provides that an ESOP fiduciary is exempt from § 1104(a)(1)(C)'s diversification requirement and also from § 1104(a)(1)(B)'s duty of prudence, but \"\\n  \\n   only to the extent that it requires diversification\\n  \\n  .\" § 1104(a)(2) (emphasis added).\\n \\n\\n  Thus, ESOP fiduciaries, unlike ERISA fiduciaries generally, are not liable for losses that result from a failure to diversify. But aside from that distinction, because ESOP fiduciaries are ERISA fiduciaries and because § 1104(a)(1)(B)'s duty of prudence applies to all ERISA fiduciaries, ESOP fiduciaries are subject to the duty of prudence just as other ERISA fiduciaries are.\\n \\n\\n\\n   B\\n  \\n\\n\\n  Petitioners make several arguments to the contrary. First, petitioners argue that the special purpose of an ESOP-investing participants' savings in the stock of their employer-calls for a presumption that such investments are prudent. Their argument is as follows: ERISA defines the duty of prudence in terms of what a prudent person would do \"in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character and with like aims.\" § 1104(a)(1)(B). The \"character\" and \"aims\" of an ESOP differ from those of an ordinary retirement investment, such as a diversified mutual fund. An ordinary plan seeks (1) to maximize retirement savings\\n    for participants while (2) avoiding excessive risk. But an ESOP also seeks (3) to promote employee ownership of employer stock. For instance, Fifth Third's Plan requires the ESOP's assets to be \"invested primarily in shares of common stock of Fifth Third.\" App. 350. In light of this additional goal, an ESOP fiduciary's decision to buy more shares of employer stock, even if it would be imprudent were it viewed solely as an attempt to secure financial retirement benefits while avoiding excessive risk, might nonetheless be prudent if understood as an attempt to promote employee ownership of employer stock, a goal that Congress views as important. See Tax Reform Act of 1976, § 803(h),\\n  \\n   90 Stat. 1590\\n  \\n  . Thus, a claim that an ESOP fiduciary's investment in employer stock was imprudent as a way of securing retirement savings should be viewed unfavorably because, unless the company was about to go out of business, that investment was advancing the additional goal of employee ownership of employer stock.\\n \\n\\n  We cannot accept the claim that underlies this argument, namely, that the content of ERISA's duty of prudence varies depending upon the specific nonpecuniary goal set out in an ERISA plan, such as what petitioners claim is the nonpecuniary goal here. Taken in context, § 1104(a)(1)(B)'s reference to \"an enterprise of a like character and with like aims\" means an enterprise with what the immediately preceding provision calls the \"exclusive purpose\" to be pursued by all ERISA fiduciaries: \"providing benefits to participants and their beneficiaries\" while \"defraying reasonable expenses of administering the plan.\" §§ 1104(a)(1)(A)(i), (ii). Read in the context of ERISA as a whole, the term \"benefits\" in the provision just quoted must be understood to refer to the sort of\\n  \\n   financial\\n  \\n  benefits (such as retirement income) that trustees who manage investments typically seek to secure for the trust's beneficiaries. Cf. § 1002(2)(A) (defining \"employee pension benefit plan\" and \"pension plan\" to mean plans that provide employees with \"retirement income\" or other \"deferral of income\"). The term does not cover nonpecuniary benefits like those supposed to arise from employee ownership of employer stock.\\n \\n\\n  Consider the statute's requirement that fiduciaries act \"in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the plan\\n  \\n   insofar as such documents and instruments are consistent with the provisions of this subchapter\\n  \\n  .\" § 1104(a)(1)(D) (emphasis added). This provision makes clear that the duty of prudence trumps the instructions of a plan document, such as an instruction to invest exclusively in employer stock even if financial goals demand the contrary. See also § 1110(a) (With irrelevant exceptions, \"any provision in an agreement or instrument which purports to relieve a fiduciary from responsibility ... for any ... duty under this part shall be void as against public policy\"). This rule would make little sense if, as petitioners argue, the duty of prudence is defined by the aims of the particular plan as set out in the plan documents, since in that case the duty of prudence could never conflict with a plan document.\\n \\n\\n  Consider also § 1104(a)(2), which exempts an ESOP fiduciary from § 1104(a)(1)(B)'s duty of prudence but \"only to the extent that it requires diversification.\" What need would there be for this specific provision were the nature of § 1104(a)(1)(B)'s duty of prudence altered anyway in the case of an ESOP in light of the ESOP's aim of promoting employee ownership of employer stock? Cf.\\n  \\n   Arlington Central School Dist. Bd. of Ed. v. Murphy,\\n  \\n\\n   548 U.S. 291\\n  \\n  , 299, n. 1,\\n  \\n   126 S.Ct. 2455\\n  \\n  ,\\n  \\n   165 L.Ed.2d 526\\n  \\n  (2006) (\"[I]t is generally\\n    presumed that statutes do not contain surplusage\").\\n \\n\\n  Petitioners are right to point out that\\n  \\n   Congress,\\n  \\n  in seeking to permit and promote ESOPs, was pursuing purposes other than the financial security of plan participants. See,\\n  \\n   e.g.,\\n  \\n  Tax Reform Act of 1976, § 803(h),\\n  \\n   90 Stat. 1590\\n  \\n  (Congress intended ESOPs to help \"secur[e] capital funds for necessary capital growth and ... brin[g] about stock ownership by all corporate employees\"). Congress pursued those purposes by promoting ESOPs with tax incentives. See\\n  \\n   26 U.S.C. §§ 402\\n  \\n  (e)(4), 404(k), 1042. And it also pursued them by exempting ESOPs from ERISA's diversification requirement, which otherwise would have precluded their creation.\\n  \\n   29 U.S.C. § 1104\\n  \\n  (a)(2). But we are not convinced that Congress\\n  \\n   also\\n  \\n  sought to promote ESOPs by further relaxing the duty of prudence as applied to ESOPs with the sort of presumption proposed by petitioners.\\n \\n\\n  Second, and relatedly, petitioners contend that the duty of prudence should be read in light of the rule under the common law of trusts that \"the settlor can reduce or waive the prudent man standard of care by specific language in the trust instrument.\" G. Bogert &amp; G. Bogert, Law of Trusts and Trustees § 541, p. 172 (rev. 2d ed. 1993); see also Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 174, Comment\\n  \\n   d\\n  \\n  (1957) (\"By the terms of the trust the requirement of care and skill may be relaxed or modified\"). The argument is that, by commanding the ESOP fiduciary to invest primarily in Fifth Third stock, the plan documents waived the duty of prudence to the extent that it comes into conflict with investment in Fifth Third stock-at least unless \"extraordinary circumstances\" arise that so threaten the goal of employee ownership of Fifth Third stock that the fiduciaries must assume that the settlor would want them to depart from that goal under the common-law \"deviation doctrine.\" See\\n  \\n\\n    id.,\\n   \\n\\n  § 167. This argument fails, however, in light of this Court's holding that, by contrast to the rule at common law, \"trust documents cannot excuse trustees from their duties under ERISA.\"\\n  \\n   Central States, Southeast &amp; Southwest Areas Pension Fund,\\n  \\n\\n   472 U.S., at 568\\n  \\n  ,\\n  \\n   105 S.Ct. 2833\\n  \\n  ; see also\\n  \\n   29 U.S.C. §§ 1104\\n  \\n  (a)(1)(D), 1110(a).\\n \\n\\n  Third, petitioners argue that subjecting ESOP fiduciaries to a duty of prudence without the protection of a special presumption will lead to conflicts with the legal prohibition on insider trading. The potential for conflict arises because ESOP fiduciaries often are company insiders and because suits against insider fiduciaries frequently allege, as the complaint in this case alleges, that the fiduciaries were imprudent in failing to act on inside information they had about the value of the employer's stock.\\n \\n\\n  This concern is a legitimate one. But an ESOP-specific rule that a fiduciary does not act imprudently in buying or holding company stock unless the company is on the brink of collapse (or the like) is an ill-fitting means of addressing it. While ESOP fiduciaries may be more likely to have insider information about a company that the fund is investing in than are other ERISA fiduciaries, the potential for conflict with the securities laws would be the same for a non-ESOP fiduciary who had relevant inside information about a potential investment. And the potential for conflict is the same for an ESOP fiduciary whose company is on the brink of collapse as for a fiduciary who is invested in a healthier company. (Surely a fiduciary is not obligated to break the insider trading laws even if his company is about to fail.) The potential for conflict therefore does not persuade us to accept a presumption of\\n    the sort adopted by the lower courts and proposed by petitioners. We discuss alternative means of dealing with the potential for conflict in Part IV,\\n  \\n   infra\\n  \\n  .\\n \\n\\n  Finally, petitioners argue that, without some sort of special presumption, the threat of costly duty-of-prudence lawsuits will deter companies from offering ESOPs to their employees, contrary to the stated intent of Congress. Cf.\\n  \\n   Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co.,\\n  \\n\\n   473 U.S., at 148, n. 17\\n  \\n  ,\\n  \\n   105 S.Ct. 3085\\n  \\n  (\"Congress was concerned lest the cost of federal standards discourage the growth of private pension plans\"). ESOP plans instruct their fiduciaries to invest in company stock, and § 1104(a)(1)(D) requires fiduciaries to follow plan documents so long as they do not conflict with ERISA. Thus, in many cases an ESOP fiduciary who fears that continuing to invest in company stock may be imprudent finds himself between a rock and a hard place: If he keeps investing and the stock goes down he may be sued for acting imprudently in violation of § 1104(a)(1)(B), but if he stops investing and the stock goes up he may be sued for disobeying the plan documents in violation of § 1104(a)(1)(D). See,\\n  \\n   e.g.,\\n  \\n\\n   White,\\n  \\n\\n   714 F.3d, at 987\\n  \\n  (\"[F]iduciaries could be liable either for the company stock's poor performance if they continue to invest in employer stock, or for missing the opportunity to benefit from good performance if they do not.... Such a high exposure to litigation risks in either direction could discourage employers from offering ESOPs, which are favored by Congress\");\\n  \\n   Evans v. Akers,\\n  \\n\\n   534 F.3d 65\\n  \\n  , 68 (C.A.1 2008) (describing two lawsuits challenging the decisions of a plan's fiduciaries with \"diametrically opposed theor[ies] of liability\": one arguing that the fiduciaries acted imprudently by continuing to invest in company stock, and the other contending that they acted imprudently by divesting \"despite the company's solid potential to emerge from bankruptcy with substantial value for shareholders\"). Petitioners argue that, given the threat of such expensive litigation, ESOPs cannot thrive unless their fiduciaries are granted a defense-friendly presumption.\\n \\n\\n  Petitioners are basically seeking relief from what they believe are meritless, economically burdensome lawsuits. We agree that Congress sought to encourage the creation of ESOPs. And we have recognized that \"ERISA represents a ' \"careful balancing\" between ensuring fair and prompt enforcement of rights under a plan and the encouragement of the creation of such plans.' \"\\n  \\n   Conkright v. Frommert,\\n  \\n\\n   559 U.S. 506\\n  \\n  , 517,\\n  \\n   130 S.Ct. 1640\\n  \\n  ,\\n  \\n   176 L.Ed.2d 469\\n  \\n  (2010) (quoting\\n  \\n   Aetna Health Inc. v. Davila,\\n  \\n\\n   542 U.S. 200\\n  \\n  , 215,\\n  \\n   124 S.Ct. 2488\\n  \\n  ,\\n  \\n   159 L.Ed.2d 312\\n  \\n  (2004)); see also\\n  \\n   Varity Corp. v. Howe,\\n  \\n\\n   516 U.S. 489\\n  \\n  , 497,\\n  \\n   116 S.Ct. 1065\\n  \\n  ,\\n  \\n   134 L.Ed.2d 130\\n  \\n  (1996) (In \"interpret[ing] ERISA's fiduciary duties,\" \"courts may have to take account of competing congressional purposes, such as Congress' desire to offer employees enhanced protection for their benefits, on the one hand, and, on the other, its desire not to create a system that is so complex that administrative costs, or litigation expenses, unduly discourage employers from offering welfare benefit plans in the first place\").\\n \\n\\n  At the same time, we do not believe that the presumption at issue here is an appropriate way to weed out meritless lawsuits or to provide the requisite \"balancing.\" The proposed presumption makes it impossible for a plaintiff to state a duty-of-prudence claim, no matter how meritorious, unless the employer is in very bad economic circumstances. Such a rule does not readily divide the plausible sheep from the meritless goats. That important task can be better accomplished through careful, context-sensitive scrutiny of a complaint's allegations. We consequently\\n    stand by our conclusion that the law does not create a special presumption of prudence for ESOP fiduciaries.\\n \\n\\n\\n   IV\\n  \\n\\n\\n  We consider more fully one important mechanism for weeding out meritless claims, the motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. That mechanism, which gave rise to the lower court decisions at issue here, requires careful judicial consideration of whether the complaint states a claim that the defendant has acted imprudently. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 12(b)(6);\\n  \\n   Ashcroft v. Iqbal,\\n  \\n\\n   556 U.S. 662\\n  \\n  , 677-680,\\n  \\n   129 S.Ct. 1937\\n  \\n  ,\\n  \\n   173 L.Ed.2d 868\\n  \\n  (2009);\\n  \\n   Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly,\\n  \\n\\n   550 U.S. 544\\n  \\n  , 554-563,\\n  \\n   127 S.Ct. 1955\\n  \\n  ,\\n  \\n   167 L.Ed.2d 929\\n  \\n  (2007). Because the content of the duty of prudence turns on \"the circumstances ... prevailing\" at the time the fiduciary acts, § 1104(a)(1)(B), the appropriate inquiry will necessarily be context specific.\\n \\n\\n  The District Court in this case granted petitioners' motion to dismiss the complaint because it held that respondents could not overcome the presumption of prudence. The Court of Appeals, by contrast, concluded that no presumption applied. And we agree with that conclusion. The Court of Appeals, however, went on to hold that respondents had stated a plausible duty-of-prudence claim.\\n  \\n   692 F.3d, at 419-420\\n  \\n  . The arguments made here, along with our review of the record, convince us that the judgment of the Court of Appeals should be vacated and the case remanded. On remand, the Court of Appeals should apply the pleading standard as discussed in\\n  \\n   Twombly\\n  \\n  and\\n  \\n   Iqbal\\n  \\n  in light of the following considerations.\\n \\n\\n\\n   A\\n  \\n\\n\\n  Respondents allege that, as of July 2007, petitioners knew or should have known in light of publicly available information, such as newspaper articles, that continuing to hold and purchase Fifth Third stock was imprudent. App. 48-53. The complaint alleges, among other things, that petitioners \"continued to allow the Plan's investment in Fifth Third Stock even during the time that the stock price was declining in value as a result of [the] collapse of the housing market\" and that \"[a] prudent fiduciary facing similar circumstances would not have stood idly by as the Plan's assets were decimated.\"\\n  \\n   Id.,\\n  \\n  at 53.\\n \\n\\n  In our view, where a stock is publicly traded, allegations that a fiduciary should have recognized from publicly available information alone that the market was over- or undervaluing the stock are implausible as a general rule, at least in the absence of special circumstances. Many investors take the view that \" 'they have little hope of outperforming the market in the long run based solely on their analysis of publicly available information,' \" and accordingly they \" 'rely on the security's market price as an unbiased assessment of the security's value in light of all public information.' \"\\n  \\n   Halliburton Co. v. Erica P. John Fund, Inc.\\n  \\n  --- U.S. ----, ----,\\n  \\n   134 S.Ct. 2398\\n  \\n  , 2411,\\n  \\n   189 L.Ed.2d 339\\n  \\n  ,\\n  \\n   2014 WL 2807181\\n  \\n  (2014) (quoting\\n  \\n   Amgen Inc. v. Connecticut Retirement Plans and Trust Funds,\\n  \\n  568 U.S. ----, ----,\\n  \\n   133 S.Ct. 1184\\n  \\n  , 1192,\\n  \\n   185 L.Ed.2d 308\\n  \\n  (2013)). ERISA fiduciaries, who likewise could reasonably see \"little hope of outperforming the market ... based solely on their analysis of publicly available information,\"\\n  \\n   ibid.,\\n  \\n  may, as a general matter, likewise prudently rely on the market price.\\n \\n\\n  In other words, a fiduciary usually \"is not imprudent to assume that a major stock market ... provides the best estimate of the value of the stocks traded on it that is available to him.\"\\n \\n\\n\\n   Summers v. State Street Bank &amp; Trust Co.,\\n  \\n\\n   453 F.3d 404\\n  \\n  , 408 (C.A.7 2006); see also\\n  \\n   White,\\n  \\n\\n   714 F.3d, at 992\\n  \\n  (A fiduciary's \"fail[ure] to outsmart a presumptively efficient market ... is ... not a sound basis for imposing liability\"); cf.\\n  \\n   Quan,\\n  \\n\\n   623 F.3d, at 881\\n  \\n  (\"Fiduciaries are not expected to predict the future of the company stock's performance\").\\n \\n\\n  We do not here consider whether a plaintiff could nonetheless plausibly allege imprudence on the basis of publicly available information by pointing to a special circumstance affecting the reliability of the market price as \" 'an unbiased assessment of the security's value in light of all public information,' \"\\n  \\n   Halliburton Co., supra,\\n  \\n  at ----,\\n  \\n   134 S.Ct., at 2411\\n  \\n  (quoting\\n  \\n   Amgen Inc., supra,\\n  \\n  at ----,\\n  \\n   133 S.Ct., at 1192\\n  \\n  ), that would make reliance on the market's valuation imprudent. In this case, the Court of Appeals held that the complaint stated a claim because respondents \"allege that Fifth Third engaged in lending practices that were equivalent to participation in the subprime lending market, that Defendants were aware of the risks of such investments by the start of the class period, and that such risks made Fifth Third stock an imprudent investment.\"\\n  \\n   692 F.3d, at 419-420\\n  \\n  . The Court of Appeals did not point to any special circumstance rendering reliance on the market price imprudent. The court's decision to deny dismissal therefore appears to have been based on an erroneous understanding of the prudence of relying on market prices.\\n \\n\\n\\n   B\\n  \\n\\n\\n  Respondents also claim that petitioners behaved imprudently by failing to act on the basis of\\n  \\n   nonpublic\\n  \\n  information that was available to them because they were Fifth Third insiders. In particular, the complaint alleges that petitioners had inside information indicating that the market was overvaluing Fifth Third stock and that they could have used this information to prevent losses to the fund by (1) selling the ESOP's holdings of Fifth Third stock; (2) refraining from future stock purchases (including by removing the Plan's ESOP option altogether); or (3) publicly disclosing the inside information so that the market would correct the stock price downward, with the result that the ESOP could continue to buy Fifth Third stock without paying an inflated price for it. See App. 17, 88-89, 113.\\n \\n\\n  To state a claim for breach of the duty of prudence on the basis of inside information, a plaintiff must plausibly allege an alternative action that the defendant could have taken that would have been consistent with the securities laws and that a prudent fiduciary in the same circumstances would not have viewed as more likely to harm the fund than to help it. The following three points inform the requisite analysis.\\n \\n\\n  First, in deciding whether the complaint states a claim upon which relief can be granted, courts must bear in mind that the duty of prudence, under ERISA as under the common law of trusts, does not require a fiduciary to break the law. Cf. Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 166, Comment\\n  \\n   a\\n  \\n  (\"The trustee is not under a duty to the beneficiary to do an act which is criminal or tortious\"). Federal securities laws \"are violated when a corporate insider trades in the securities of his corporation on the basis of material, nonpublic information.\"\\n  \\n   United States v. O'Hagan,\\n  \\n\\n   521 U.S. 642\\n  \\n  , 651-652,\\n  \\n   117 S.Ct. 2199\\n  \\n  ,\\n  \\n   138 L.Ed.2d 724\\n  \\n  (1997). As every Court of Appeals to address the question has held, ERISA's duty of prudence cannot require an ESOP fiduciary to perform an action-such as divesting the fund's holdings of the employer's stock on the basis of inside information-that would violate the securities laws. See,\\n  \\n   e.g.,\\n  \\n\\n   Rinehart v. Akers,\\n  \\n\\n   722 F.3d 137\\n  \\n  , 146-147 (C.A.2 2013);\\n  \\n   Kirschbaum v. Reliant Energy, Inc.,\\n  \\n\\n   526 F.3d 243\\n  \\n  , 256 (C.A.5 2008);\\n  \\n   White,\\n   \\n    supra,\\n   \\n\\n\\n   at 992\\n  \\n  ;\\n  \\n   Quan,\\n   \\n    supra,\\n   \\n\\n\\n   at 881-882\\n  \\n  , and n. 8;\\n  \\n   Lanfear v.

       "      <td>Petitioner Fifth Third Bancorp maintains a defined-contribution retirement savings plan for its employees. Plan participants may direct their contributions into any of a number of investment options, including an \"employee stock ownership plan\" (ESOP), which invests its funds primarily in Fifth Third stock. Respondents, former Fifth Third employees and ESOP participants, filed this lawsuit against petitioners, Fifth Third and several of its officers who are alleged to be fiduciaries of the ESOP. The complaint alleges that petitioners breached the fiduciary duty of prudence imposed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), 29 U.S.C. § 1104 (a)(1)(B). Specifically, the complaint alleges that petitioners should have known-on the basis of both publicly available information and inside information available to petitioners because they were Fifth Third officers-that Fifth Third stock was overpriced and excessively risky. It further alleges that a prudent fiduciary in petitioners' position would have responded to this information by selling off the ESOP's holdings of Fifth Third stock, refraining from purchasing more Fifth Third stock, or disclosing the negative inside information so that the market could correct the stock's price downward. According to the complaint, petitioners did none of these things, and the price of Fifth Third stock ultimately fell, reducing respondents' retirement savings. The District Court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim, but the Sixth Circuit reversed. It concluded that ESOP fiduciaries are entitled to a \"presumption of prudence\" that does not apply to other ERISA fiduciaries but that the presumption is an evidentiary one and therefore does not apply at the pleading stage. The court went on to hold that the complaint stated a claim for breach of fiduciary duty. Held : 1. ESOP fiduciaries are not entitled to any special presumption of prudence. Rather, they are subject to the same duty of prudence that applies to ERISA fiduciaries in general, § 1104(a)(1)(B), except that they need not diversify the fund's assets, § 1104(a)(2). This conclusion follows from the relevant provisions of ERISA. Section 1104(a)(1)(B) \"imposes a 'prudent person' standard by which to measure fiduciaries' investment decisions and disposition of assets.\" Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Russell, 473 U.S. 134 , 143, n. 10, 105 S.Ct. 3085 , 87 L.Ed.2d 96 .Section 1104(a)(1)(C) requires ERISA fiduciaries to diversify plan assets. And § 1104(a)(2) establishes the extent to which those duties are loosened in the ESOP context by providing that \"the diversification requirement of [§ 1104(a)(1)(C) ] and the prudence requirement (only to the extent that it requires diversification) of [§ 1104(a)(1)(B) ] [are] not violated by acquisition or holding of [employer stock].\" Section 1104(a)(2) makes no reference to a special \"presumption\" in favor of ESOP fiduciaries and does not require plaintiffs to allege that the employer was, e.g., on the \"brink of collapse.\" It simply modifies the duties imposed by § 1104(a)(1) in a precisely delineated way. Thus, aside from the fact that ESOP fiduciaries are not liable for losses that result from a failure to diversify, they are subject to the duty of prudence like other ERISA fiduciaries. Pp. 2465 - 2471. 2. On remand, the Sixth Circuit should reconsider whether the complaint states a claim by applying the pleading standard as discussed in Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662 , 677-680, 129 S.Ct. 1937 , 173 L.Ed.2d 868 , and Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544 , 554-563, 127 S.Ct. 1955 , 167 L.Ed.2d 929 , in light of the following considerations. Pp. 2471 - 2473. (a) Where a stock is publicly traded, allegations that a fiduciary should have recognized on the basis of publicly available information that the market was overvaluing or undervaluing the stock are generally implausible and thus insufficient to state a claim under Twombly and Iqbal . Pp. 2471 - 2472. (b) To state a claim for breach of the duty of prudence, a complaint must plausibly allege an alternative action that the defendant could have taken, that would have been legal, and that a prudent fiduciary in the same circumstances would not have viewed as more likely to harm the fund than to help it. Where the complaint alleges that a fiduciary was imprudent in failing to act on the basis of inside information, the analysis is informed by the following points. First, ERISA's duty of prudence never requires a fiduciary to break the law, and so a fiduciary cannot be imprudent for failing to buy or sell stock in violation of the insider trading laws. Second, where a complaint faults fiduciaries for failing to decide, based on negative inside information, to refrain from making additional stock purchases or for failing to publicly disclose that information so that the stock would no longer be overvalued, courts should consider the extent to which imposing an ERISA-based obligation either to refrain from making a planned trade or to disclose inside information to the public could conflict with the complex insider trading and corporate disclosure requirements set forth by the federal securities laws or with the objectives of those laws. Third, courts confronted with such claims should consider whether the complaint has plausibly alleged that a prudent fiduciary in the defendant's position could not have concluded that stopping purchases or publicly disclosing negative information would do more harm than good to the fund by causing a drop in the stock price and a concomitant drop in the value of the stock already held by the fund.

Justice delivered the opinion of the Court. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), 88 Stat. 829 , as amended, 29 U.S.C. § 1001 et seq ., requires the fiduciary of a pension plan to act prudently in managing the plan's assets. § 1104(a)(1)(B). This case focuses upon that duty of prudence as applied to the fiduciary of an \"employee stock ownership plan\" (ESOP), a type of pension plan that invests primarily in the stock of the company that employs the plan participants. We consider whether, when an ESOP fiduciary's decision to buy or hold the employer's stock is challenged in court, the fiduciary is entitled to a defense-friendly standard that the lower courts have called a \"presumption of prudence.\" The Courts of Appeals that have considered the question have held that such a presumption does apply, with the presumption generally defined as a requirement that the plaintiff make a showing that would not be required in an ordinary duty-of-prudence case, such as that the employer was on the brink of collapse. We hold that no such presumption applies. Instead, ESOP fiduciaries are subject to the same duty of prudence that applies to ERISA fiduciaries in general, except that they need not diversify the fund's assets. § 1104(a)(2). I Petitioner Fifth Third Bancorp, a large financial services firm, maintains for its employees a defined-contribution retirement savings plan. Employees may choose to contribute a portion of their compensation to the Plan as retirement savings, and Fifth Third provides matching contributions of up to 4% of an employee's compensation. The Plan's assets are invested in 20 separate funds, including mutual funds and an ESOP. Plan participants can allocate their contributions among the funds however they like; Fifth Third's matching contributions, on the other hand, are always invested initially in the ESOP, though the participant can then choose to move them to another fund. The Plan requires the ESOP's funds to be \"invested primarily in shares of common stock of Fifth Third.\" App. 350. Respondents, who are former Fifth Third employees and ESOP participants, filed this putative class action in Federal District Court in Ohio. They claim that petitioners, Fifth Third and various Fifth Third officers, were fiduciaries of the Plan and violated the duties of loyalty and prudence imposed by ERISA. See §§ 1109(a), 1132(a)(2). We limit our review to the duty-of-prudence claims. The complaint alleges that by July 2007, the fiduciaries knew or should have known that Fifth Third's stock was overvalued and excessively risky for two separate reasons. First, publicly available information such as newspaper articles provided early warning signs that subprime lending, which formed a large part of Fifth Third's business, would soon leave creditors high and dry as the housing market collapsed and subprime borrowers became unable to pay off their mortgages. Second, nonpublic information (which petitioners knew because they were Fifth Third insiders) indicated that Fifth Third officers had deceived the market by making material misstatements about the company's financial prospects. Those misstatements led the market to overvalue Fifth Third stock-the ESOP's primary investment-and so petitioners, using the participants' money, were consequently paying more for that stock than it was worth. The complaint further alleges that a prudent fiduciary in petitioners' position would have responded to this information in one or more of the following ways: (1) by selling the ESOP's holdings of Fifth Third stock before the value of those holdings declined, (2) by refraining from purchasing any more Fifth Third stock, (3) by canceling the Plan's ESOP option, and (4) by disclosing the inside information so that the market would adjust its valuation of Fifth Third stock downward and the ESOP would no longer be overpaying for it. Rather than follow any of these courses of action, petitioners continued to hold and buy Fifth Third stock. Then the market crashed, and Fifth Third's stock price fell by 74% between July 2007 and September 2009, when the complaint was filed. Since the ESOP's funds were invested primarily in Fifth Third stock, this fall in price eliminated a large part of the retirement savings that the participants had invested in the ESOP. (The stock has since made a partial recovery to around half of its July 2007 price.) The District Court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim. 757 F.Supp.2d 753 (S.D.Ohio 2010). The court began from the premise that where a lawsuit challenges ESOP fiduciaries' investment decisions, \"the plan fiduciaries start with a presumption that their 'decision to remain invested in employer securities was reasonable.' \" Id., at 758 (quoting Kuper v. Iovenko, 66 F.3d 1447 , 1459 (C.A.6 1995)). The court next held that this rule is applicable at the pleading stage and then concluded that the complaint's allegations were insufficient to overcome it. 757 F.Supp.2d, at 758-759, 760-762 . The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed. 692 F.3d 410 (2012). Although it agreed that ESOP fiduciaries are entitled to a presumption of prudence, it took the view that the presumption is evidentiary only and therefore does not apply at the pleading stage. Id., at 418-419 . Thus, the Sixth Circuit simply asked whether the allegations in the complaint were sufficient to state a claim for breach of fiduciary duty. Id., at 419 . It held that they were. Id., at 419-420 . In light of differences among the Courts of Appeals as to the nature of the presumption of prudence applicable to ESOP fiduciaries, we granted the fiduciaries' petition for certiorari. Compare In re Citigroup ERISA Litigation, 662 F.3d 128 , 139-140 (C.A.2 2011) (presumption of prudence applies at the pleading stage and requires the plaintiff to establish that the employer was \"in a 'dire situation' that was objectively unforeseeable by the settlor\" (quoting Edgar v. Avaya, Inc., 503 F.3d 340 , 348 (C.A.3 2007))), with Pfeil v. State Street Bank &amp; Trust Co., 671 F.3d 585 , 592-596 (C.A.6 2012) (presumption of prudence applies only at summary judgment and beyond and only requires the plaintiff to establish that \" 'a prudent fiduciary acting under similar circumstances would have made a different investment decision' \" (quoting Kuper, supra, at 1459 )). II A In applying a \"presumption of prudence\" that favors ESOP fiduciaries' purchasing or holding of employer stock, the lower courts have sought to reconcile congressional directives that are in some tension with each other. On the one hand, ERISA itself subjects pension plan fiduciaries to a duty of prudence. In a section titled \"Fiduciary duties,\" it says: \"(a) Prudent man standard of care \"(1) Subject to sections 1103(c) and (d), 1342, and 1344 of this title, a fiduciary shall discharge his duties with respect to a plan solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries and- \"(A) for the exclusive purpose of: \"(i) providing benefits to participants and their beneficiaries; and \"(ii) defraying reasonable expenses of administering the plan; \"(B) with the care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing that a prudent man acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character and with like aims; \"(C) by diversifying the investments of the plan so as to minimize the risk of large losses, unless under the circumstances it is clearly prudent not to do so; and \"(D) in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the plan insofar as such documents and instruments are consistent with the provisions of this subchapter and subchapter III of this chapter.\" § 1104. See also Central States, Southeast &amp; Southwest Areas Pension Fund v. Central Transport, Inc., 472 U.S. 559 , 570, 105 S.Ct. 2833 , 86 L.Ed.2d 447 (1985) (Section 1104(a)(1) imposes \"strict standards of trustee conduct ... derived from the common law of trusts-most prominently, a standard of loyalty and a standard of care\"). On the other hand, Congress recognizes that ESOPs are \"designed to invest primarily in\" the stock of the participants' employer, § 1107(d)(6)(A), meaning that they are not prudently diversified. And it has written into law its \"interest in encouraging\" their use. One statutory provision says: \"Intent of Congress Concerning Employee Stock Ownership Plans.-The Congress, in a series of laws [including ERISA] has made clear its interest in encouraging [ESOPs] as a bold and innovative method of strengthening the free private enterprise system which will solve the dual problems of securing capital funds for necessary capital growth and of bringing about stock ownership by all corporate employees. The Congress is deeply concerned that the objectives sought by this series of laws will be made unattainable by regulations and rulings which treat [ESOPs] as conventional retirement plans, which reduce the freedom of the employee trusts and employers to take the necessary steps to implement the plans, and which otherwise block the establishment and success of these plans.\" Tax Reform Act of 1976, § 803(h), 90 Stat. 1590 . In addition, and in keeping with this statement of intent, Congress has given ESOP fiduciaries a statutory exemption from some of the duties imposed on ERISA fiduciaries. ERISA specifically provides that, in the case of ESOPs and other eligible individual account plans, \"the diversification requirement of [§ 1104(a)(1)(C) ] and the prudence requirement (only to the extent that it requires diversification) of [§ 1104(a)(1)(B) ] [are] not violated by acquisition or holding of [employer stock].\" § 1104(a)(2). Thus, an ESOP fiduciary is not obliged under § 1104(a)(1)(C) to \"diversif[y] the investments of the plan so as to minimize the risk of large losses\" or under § 1104(a)(1)(B) to act \"with the care, skill, prudence, and diligence\" of a \"prudent man\" insofar as that duty \"requires diversification.\" B Several Courts of Appeals have gone beyond ERISA's express provision that ESOP fiduciaries need not diversify by giving ESOP fiduciaries a \"presumption of prudence\" when their decisions to hold or buy employer stock are challenged as imprudent. Thus, the Third Circuit has held that \"an ESOP fiduciary who invests the [ESOP's] assets in employer stock is entitled to a presumption that it acted consistently with ERISA\" in doing so. Moench v. Robertson, 62 F.3d 553 , 571 (1995). The Ninth Circuit has said that to \"overcome the presumption of prudent investment, plaintiffs must ... make allegations that clearly implicate the company's viability as an ongoing concern or show a precipitous decline in the employer's stock ... combined with evidence that the company is on the brink of collapse or is undergoing serious mismanagement.\" Quan v. Computer Sciences Corp., 623 F.3d 870 , 882 (2010) (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted). And the Seventh Circuit has described the presumption as requiring plaintiffs to \"allege and ultimately prove that the company faced 'impending collapse' or 'dire circumstances' that could not have been foreseen by the founder of the plan.\" White v. Marshall &amp; Ilsley Corp., 714 F.3d 980 , 989 (2013). The Sixth Circuit agreed that some sort of presumption favoring an ESOP fiduciary's purchase of employer stock is appropriate. But it held that this presumption is an evidentiary rule that does not apply at the pleading stage. It further held that, to overcome the presumption, a plaintiff need not show that the employer was on the \"brink of collapse\" or the like. Rather, the plaintiff need only show that \" 'a prudent fiduciary acting under similar circumstances would have made a different investment decision.' \" 692 F.3d, at 418 (quoting Kuper, 66 F.3d, at 1459 ). Petitioners argue that the lower courts are right to apply a presumption of prudence, that it should apply from the pleading stage onward, and that the presumption should be strongly in favor of ESOP fiduciaries' purchasing and holding of employer stock. In particular, petitioners propose a rule that a challenge to an ESOP fiduciary's decision to hold or buy company stock \"cannot prevail unless extraordinary circumstances, such as a serious threat to the employer's viability, mean that continued investment would substantially impair the purpose of the plan.\" Brief for Petitioners 16. In petitioners' view, the \"purpose of the plan,\" in the case of an ESOP, is promoting employee ownership of the employer's stock over the long term. And, petitioners assert, that purpose is \"substantially impair[ed]\"-rendering continued investment imprudent-only when \"a serious threat to the employer's viability\" makes it likely that the employer will go out of business. This is because the goal of employee ownership will be substantially impaired only if the employer goes out of business, leaving the employees with no company to own. Id., at 24. We must decide whether ERISA contains some such presumption. III A In our view, the law does not create a special presumption favoring ESOP fiduciaries. Rather, the same standard of prudence applies to all ERISA fiduciaries, including ESOP fiduciaries, except that an ESOP fiduciary is under no duty to diversify the ESOP's holdings. This conclusion follows from the pertinent provisions of ERISA, which are set forth above. Section 1104(a)(1)(B) \"imposes a 'prudent person' standard by which to measure fiduciaries' investment decisions and disposition of assets.\" Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Russell, 473 U.S. 134 , 143, n. 10, 105 S.Ct. 3085 , 87 L.Ed.2d 96 (1985). Section 1104(a)(1)(C) requires ERISA fiduciaries to diversify plan assets. And § 1104(a)(2) establishes the extent to which those duties are loosened in the ESOP context to ensure that employers are permitted and encouraged to offer ESOPs. Section 1104(a)(2) makes no reference to a special \"presumption\" in favor of ESOP fiduciaries. It does not require plaintiffs to allege that the employer was on the \"brink of collapse,\" under \"extraordinary circumstances,\" or the like. Instead, § 1104(a)(2) simply modifies the duties imposed by § 1104(a)(1) in a precisely delineated way: It provides that an ESOP fiduciary is exempt from § 1104(a)(1)(C)'s diversification requirement and also from § 1104(a)(1)(B)'s duty of prudence, but \" only to the extent that it requires diversification .\" § 1104(a)(2) (emphasis added). Thus, ESOP fiduciaries, unlike ERISA fiduciaries generally, are not liable for losses that result from a failure to diversify. But aside from that distinction, because ESOP fiduciaries are ERISA fiduciaries and because § 1104(a)(1)(B)'s duty of prudence applies to all ERISA fiduciaries, ESOP fiduciaries are subject to the duty of prudence just as other ERISA fiduciaries are. B Petitioners make several arguments to the contrary. First, petitioners argue that the special purpose of an ESOP-investing participants' savings in the stock of their employer-calls for a presumption that such investments are prudent. Their argument is as follows: ERISA defines the duty of prudence in terms of what a prudent person would do \"in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character and with like aims.\" § 1104(a)(1)(B). The \"character\" and \"aims\" of an ESOP differ from those of an ordinary retirement investment, such as a diversified mutual fund. An ordinary plan seeks (1) to maximize retirement savings for participants while (2) avoiding excessive risk. But an ESOP also seeks (3) to promote employee ownership of employer stock. For instance, Fifth Third's Plan requires the ESOP's assets to be \"invested primarily in shares of common stock of Fifth Third.\" App. 350. In light of this additional goal, an ESOP fiduciary's decision to buy more shares of employer stock, even if it would be imprudent were it viewed solely as an attempt to secure financial retirement benefits while avoiding excessive risk, might nonetheless be prudent if understood as an attempt to promote employee ownership of employer stock, a goal that Congress views as important. See Tax Reform Act of 1976, § 803(h), 90 Stat. 1590 . Thus, a claim that an ESOP fiduciary's investment in employer stock was imprudent as a way of securing retirement savings should be viewed unfavorably because, unless the company was about to go out of business, that investment was advancing the additional goal of employee ownership of employer stock. We cannot accept the claim that underlies this argument, namely, that the content of ERISA's duty of prudence varies depending upon the specific nonpecuniary goal set out in an ERISA plan, such as what petitioners claim is the nonpecuniary goal here. Taken in context, § 1104(a)(1)(B)'s reference to \"an enterprise of a like character and with like aims\" means an enterprise with what the immediately preceding provision calls the \"exclusive purpose\" to be pursued by all ERISA fiduciaries: \"providing benefits to participants and their beneficiaries\" while \"defraying reasonable expenses of administering the plan.\" §§ 1104(a)(1)(A)(i), (ii). Read in the context of ERISA as a whole, the term \"benefits\" in the provision just quoted must be understood to refer to the sort of financial benefits (such as retirement income) that trustees who manage investments typically seek to secure for the trust's beneficiaries. Cf. § 1002(2)(A) (defining \"employee pension benefit plan\" and \"pension plan\" to mean plans that provide employees with \"retirement income\" or other \"deferral of income\"). The term does not cover nonpecuniary benefits like those supposed to arise from employee ownership of employer stock. Consider the statute's requirement that fiduciaries act \"in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the plan insofar as such documents and instruments are consistent with the provisions of this subchapter .\" § 1104(a)(1)(D) (emphasis added). This provision makes clear that the duty of prudence trumps the instructions of a plan document, such as an instruction to invest exclusively in employer stock even if financial goals demand the contrary. See also § 1110(a) (With irrelevant exceptions, \"any provision in an agreement or instrument which purports to relieve a fiduciary from responsibility ... for any ... duty under this part shall be void as against public policy\"). This rule would make little sense if, as petitioners argue, the duty of prudence is defined by the aims of the particular plan as set out in the plan documents, since in that case the duty of prudence could never conflict with a plan document. Consider also § 1104(a)(2), which exempts an ESOP fiduciary from § 1104(a)(1)(B)'s duty of prudence but \"only to the extent that it requires diversification.\" What need would there be for this specific provision were the nature of § 1104(a)(1)(B)'s duty of prudence altered anyway in the case of an ESOP in light of the ESOP's aim of promoting employee ownership of employer stock? Cf. Arlington Central School Dist. Bd. of Ed. v. Murphy, 548 U.S. 291 , 299, n. 1, 126 S.Ct. 2455 , 165 L.Ed.2d 526 (2006) (\"[I]t is generally presumed that statutes do not contain surplusage\"). Petitioners are right to point out that Congress, in seeking to permit and promote ESOPs, was pursuing purposes other than the financial security of plan participants. See, e.g., Tax Reform Act of 1976, § 803(h), 90 Stat. 1590 (Congress intended ESOPs to help \"secur[e] capital funds for necessary capital growth and ... brin[g] about stock ownership by all corporate employees\"). Congress pursued those purposes by promoting ESOPs with tax incentives. See 26 U.S.C. §§ 402 (e)(4), 404(k), 1042. And it also pursued them by exempting ESOPs from ERISA's diversification requirement, which otherwise would have precluded their creation. 29 U.S.C. § 1104 (a)(2). But we are not convinced that Congress also sought to promote ESOPs by further relaxing the duty of prudence as applied to ESOPs with the sort of presumption proposed by petitioners. Second, and relatedly, petitioners contend that the duty of prudence should be read in light of the rule under the common law of trusts that \"the settlor can reduce or waive the prudent man standard of care by specific language in the trust instrument.\" G. Bogert &amp; G. Bogert, Law of Trusts and Trustees § 541, p. 172 (rev. 2d ed. 1993); see also Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 174, Comment d (1957) (\"By the terms of the trust the requirement of care and skill may be relaxed or modified\"). The argument is that, by commanding the ESOP fiduciary to invest primarily in Fifth Third stock, the plan documents waived the duty of prudence to the extent that it comes into conflict with investment in Fifth Third stock-at least unless \"extraordinary circumstances\" arise that so threaten the goal of employee ownership of Fifth Third stock that the fiduciaries must assume that the settlor would want them to depart from that goal under the common-law \"deviation doctrine.\" See id., § 167. This argument fails, however, in light of this Court's holding that, by contrast to the rule at common law, \"trust documents cannot excuse trustees from their duties under ERISA.\" Central States, Southeast &amp; Southwest Areas Pension Fund, 472 U.S., at 568 , 105 S.Ct. 2833 ; see also 29 U.S.C. §§ 1104 (a)(1)(D), 1110(a). Third, petitioners argue that subjecting ESOP fiduciaries to a duty of prudence without the protection of a special presumption will lead to conflicts with the legal prohibition on insider trading. The potential for conflict arises because ESOP fiduciaries often are company insiders and because suits against insider fiduciaries frequently allege, as the complaint in this case alleges, that the fiduciaries were imprudent in failing to act on inside information they had about the value of the employer's stock. This concern is a legitimate one. But an ESOP-specific rule that a fiduciary does not act imprudently in buying or holding company stock unless the company is on the brink of collapse (or the like) is an ill-fitting means of addressing it. While ESOP fiduciaries may be more likely to have insider information about a company that the fund is investing in than are other ERISA fiduciaries, the potential for conflict with the securities laws would be the same for a non-ESOP fiduciary who had relevant inside information about a potential investment. And the potential for conflict is the same for an ESOP fiduciary whose company is on the brink of collapse as for a fiduciary who is invested in a healthier company. (Surely a fiduciary is not obligated to break the insider trading laws even if his company is about to fail.) The potential for conflict therefore does not persuade us to accept a presumption of the sort adopted by the lower courts and proposed by petitioners. We discuss alternative means of dealing with the potential for conflict in Part IV, infra . Finally, petitioners argue that, without some sort of special presumption, the threat of costly duty-of-prudence lawsuits will deter companies from offering ESOPs to their employees, contrary to the stated intent of Congress. Cf. Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co., 473 U.S., at 148, n. 17 , 105 S.Ct. 3085 (\"Congress was concerned lest the cost of federal standards discourage the growth of private pension plans\"). ESOP plans instruct their fiduciaries to invest in company stock, and § 1104(a)(1)(D) requires fiduciaries to follow plan documents so long as they do not conflict with ERISA. Thus, in many cases an ESOP fiduciary who fears that continuing to invest in company stock may be imprudent finds himself between a rock and a hard place: If he keeps investing and the stock goes down he may be sued for acting imprudently in violation of § 1104(a)(1)(B), but if he stops investing and the stock goes up he may be sued for disobeying the plan documents in violation of § 1104(a)(1)(D). See, e.g., White, 714 F.3d, at 987 (\"[F]iduciaries could be liable either for the company stock's poor performance if they continue to invest in employer stock, or for missing the opportunity to benefit from good performance if they do not.... Such a high exposure to litigation risks in either direction could discourage employers from offering ESOPs, which are favored by Congress\"); Evans v. Akers, 534 F.3d 65 , 68 (C.A.1 2008) (describing two lawsuits challenging the decisions of a plan's fiduciaries with \"diametrically opposed theor[ies] of liability\": one arguing that the fiduciaries acted imprudently by continuing to invest in company stock, and the other contending that they acted imprudently by divesting \"despite the company's solid potential to emerge from bankruptcy with substantial value for shareholders\"). Petitioners argue that, given the threat of such expensive litigation, ESOPs cannot thrive unless their fiduciaries are granted a defense-friendly presumption. Petitioners are basically seeking relief from what they believe are meritless, economically burdensome lawsuits. We agree that Congress sought to encourage the creation of ESOPs. And we have recognized that \"ERISA represents a ' \"careful balancing\" between ensuring fair and prompt enforcement of rights under a plan and the encouragement of the creation of such plans.' \" Conkright v. Frommert, 559 U.S. 506 , 517, 130 S.Ct. 1640 , 176 L.Ed.2d 469 (2010) (quoting Aetna Health Inc. v. Davila, 542 U.S. 200 , 215, 124 S.Ct. 2488 , 159 L.Ed.2d 312 (2004)); see also Varity Corp. v. Howe, 516 U.S. 489 , 497, 116 S.Ct. 1065 , 134 L.Ed.2d 130 (1996) (In \"interpret[ing] ERISA's fiduciary duties,\" \"courts may have to take account of competing congressional purposes, such as Congress' desire to offer employees enhanced protection for their benefits, on the one hand, and, on the other, its desire not to create a system that is so complex that administrative costs, or litigation expenses, unduly discourage employers from offering welfare benefit plans in the first place\"). At the same time, we do not believe that the presumption at issue here is an appropriate way to weed out meritless lawsuits or to provide the requisite \"balancing.\" The proposed presumption makes it impossible for a plaintiff to state a duty-of-prudence claim, no matter how meritorious, unless the employer is in very bad economic circumstances. Such a rule does not readily divide the plausible sheep from the meritless goats. That important task can be better accomplished through careful, context-sensitive scrutiny of a complaint's allegations. We consequently stand by our conclusion that the law does not create a special presumption of prudence for ESOP fiduciaries. IV We consider more fully one important mechanism for weeding out meritless claims, the motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. That mechanism, which gave rise to the lower court decisions at issue here, requires careful judicial consideration of whether the complaint states a claim that the defendant has acted imprudently. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 12(b)(6); Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662 , 677-680, 129 S.Ct. 1937 , 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009); Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544 , 554-563, 127 S.Ct. 1955 , 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007). Because the content of the duty of prudence turns on \"the circumstances ... prevailing\" at the time the fiduciary acts, § 1104(a)(1)(B), the appropriate inquiry will necessarily be context specific. The District Court in this case granted petitioners' motion to dismiss the complaint because it held that respondents could not overcome the presumption of prudence. The Court of Appeals, by contrast, concluded that no presumption applied. And we agree with that conclusion. The Court of Appeals, however, went on to hold that respondents had stated a plausible duty-of-prudence claim. 692 F.3d, at 419-420 . The arguments made here, along with our review of the record, convince us that the judgment of the Court of Appeals should be vacated and the case remanded. On remand, the Court of Appeals should apply the pleading standard as discussed in Twombly and Iqbal in light of the following considerations. A Respondents allege that, as of July 2007, petitioners knew or should have known in light of publicly available information, such as newspaper articles, that continuing to hold and purchase Fifth Third stock was imprudent. App. 48-53. The complaint alleges, among other things, that petitioners \"continued to allow the Plan's investment in Fifth Third Stock even during the time that the stock price was declining in value as a result of [the] collapse of the housing market\" and that \"[a] prudent fiduciary facing similar circumstances would not have stood idly by as the Plan's assets were decimated.\" Id., at 53. In our view, where a stock is publicly traded, allegations that a fiduciary should have recognized from publicly available information alone that the market was over- or undervaluing the stock are implausible as a general rule, at least in the absence of special circumstances. Many investors take the view that \" 'they have little hope of outperforming the market in the long run based solely on their analysis of publicly available information,' \" and accordingly they \" 'rely on the security's market price as an unbiased assessment of the security's value in light of all public information.' \" Halliburton Co. v. Erica P. John Fund, Inc. --- U.S. ----, ----, 134 S.Ct. 2398 , 2411, 189 L.Ed.2d 339 , 2014 WL 2807181 (2014) (quoting Amgen Inc. v. Connecticut Retirement Plans and Trust Funds, 568 U.S. ----, ----, 133 S.Ct. 1184 , 1192, 185 L.Ed.2d 308 (2013)). ERISA fiduciaries, who likewise could reasonably see \"little hope of outperforming the market ... based solely on their analysis of publicly available information,\" ibid., may, as a general matter, likewise prudently rely on the market price. In other words, a fiduciary usually \"is not imprudent to assume that a major stock market ... provides the best estimate of the value of the stocks traded on it that is available to him.\" Summers v. State Street Bank &amp; Trust Co., 453 F.3d 404 , 408 (C.A.7 2006); see also White, 714 F.3d, at 992 (A fiduciary's \"fail[ure] to outsmart a presumptively efficient market ... is ... not a sound basis for imposing liability\"); cf. Quan, 623 F.3d, at 881 (\"Fiduciaries are not expected to predict the future of the company stock's performance\"). We do not here consider whether a plaintiff could nonetheless plausibly allege imprudence on the basis of publicly available information by pointing to a special circumstance affecting the reliability of the market price as \" 'an unbiased assessment of the security's value in light of all public information,' \" Halliburton Co., supra, at ----, 134 S.Ct., at 2411 (quoting Amgen Inc., supra, at ----, 133 S.Ct., at 1192 ), that would make reliance on the market's valuation imprudent. In this case, the Court of Appeals held that the complaint stated a claim because respondents \"allege that Fifth Third engaged in lending practices that were equivalent to participation in the subprime lending market, that Defendants were aware of the risks of such investments by the start of the class period, and that such risks made Fifth Third stock an imprudent investment.\" 692 F.3d, at 419-420 . The Court of Appeals did not point to any special circumstance rendering reliance on the market price imprudent. The court's decision to deny dismissal therefore appears to have been based on an erroneous understanding of the prudence of relying on market prices. B Respondents also claim that petitioners behaved imprudently by failing to act on the basis of nonpublic information that was available to them because they were Fifth Third insiders. In particular, the complaint alleges that petitioners had inside information indicating that the market was overvaluing Fifth Third stock and that they could have used this information to prevent losses to the fund by (1) selling the ESOP's holdings of Fifth Third stock; (2) refraining from future stock purchases (including by removing the Plan's ESOP option altogether); or (3) publicly disclosing the inside information so that the market would correct the stock price downward, with the result that the ESOP could continue to buy Fifth Third stock without paying an inflated price for it. See App. 17, 88-89, 113. To state a claim for breach of the duty of prudence on the basis of inside information, a plaintiff must plausibly allege an alternative action that the defendant could have taken that would have been consistent with the securities laws and that a prudent fiduciary in the same circumstances would not have viewed as more likely to harm the fund than to help it. The following three points inform the requisite analysis. First, in deciding whether the complaint states a claim upon which relief can be granted, courts must bear in mind that the duty of prudence, under ERISA as under the common law of trusts, does not require a fiduciary to break the law. Cf. Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 166, Comment a (\"The trustee is not under a duty to the beneficiary to do an act which is criminal or tortious\"). Federal securities laws \"are violated when a corporate insider trades in the securities of his corporation on the basis of material, nonpublic information.\" United States v. O'Hagan, 521 U.S. 642 , 651-652, 117 S.Ct. 2199 , 138 L.Ed.2d 724 (1997). As every Court of Appeals to address the question has held, ERISA's duty of prudence cannot require an ESOP fiduciary to perform an action-such as divesting the fund's holdings of the employer's stock on the basis of inside information-that would violate the securities laws. See, e.g., Rinehart v. Akers, 722 F.3d 137 , 146-147 (C.A.2 2013); Kirschbaum v. Reliant Energy, Inc., 526 F.3d 243 , 256 (C.A.5 2008); White, supra, at 992 ; Quan, supra, at 881-882 , and n. 8; Lanfear v. Home Depot, Inc., 679 F.3d 1267 , 1282 (C.A.11 2012). To the extent that the Sixth Circuit denied dismissal based on the theory that the duty of prudence required petitioners to sell the ESOP's holdings of Fifth Third stock, its denial of dismissal was erroneous. Second, where a complaint faults fiduciaries for failing to decide, on the basis of the inside information, to refrain from making additional stock purchases or for failing to disclose that information to the public so that the stock would no longer be overvalued, additional considerations arise. The courts should consider the extent to which an ERISA-based obligation either to refrain on the basis of inside information from making a planned trade or to disclose inside information to the public could conflict with the complex insider trading and corporate disclosure requirements imposed by the federal securities laws or with the objectives of those laws. Cf. 29 U.S.C. § 1144 (d) (\"Nothing in this subchapter [which includes § 1104] shall be construed to alter, amend, modify, invalidate, impair, or supersede any law of the United States ... or any rule or regulation issued under any such law\"); Black &amp; Decker Disability Plan v. Nord, 538 U.S. 822 , 831, 123 S.Ct. 1965 , 155 L.Ed.2d 1034 (2003) (\"Although Congress 'expect[ed]' courts would develop 'a federal common law of rights and obligations under ERISA-regulated plans,' the scope of permissible judicial innovation is narrower in areas where other federal actors are engaged\" (quoting Pilot Life Ins. Co. v. Dedeaux, 481 U.S. 41 , 56, 107 S.Ct. 1549 , 95 L.Ed.2d 39 (1987); citation omitted)); Varity Corp., 516 U.S., at 506 , 116 S.Ct. 1065 (reserving the question \"whether ERISA fiduciaries have any fiduciary duty to disclose truthful information on their own initiative, or in response to employee inquiries\"). The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has not advised us of its views on these matters, and we believe those views may well be relevant. Third, lower courts faced with such claims should also consider whether the complaint has plausibly alleged that a prudent fiduciary in the defendant's position could not have concluded that stopping purchases-which the market might take as a sign that insider fiduciaries viewed the employer's stock as a bad investment-or publicly disclosing negative information would do more harm than good to the fund by causing a drop in the stock price and a concomitant drop in the value of the stock already held by the fund. * * * We leave it to the courts below to apply the foregoing to the complaint in this case in the first instance. The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit is vacated and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. It is so ordered.

Pendleton Rogers,  Senior Assistant Attorneys General, Barbara H. Vann, Assistant Attorney General, and Peter W. Low.[*]\\n*89 Justice Thomas, delivered the opinion of the Court.\\nIn Davis v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury, 489 U. S. 803 (1989), we held that a State violates the constitutional doctrine of intergovernmental tax immunity when it taxes retirement benefits paid by the Federal Government but exempts from taxation all retirement benefits paid by the State or its political subdivisions. Relying on the retroactivity analysis of Chevron Oil Co. v. Huson, 404 U. S. 97 (1971), the Supreme Court of Virginia twice refused to apply Davis to *90 taxes imposed before Davis was decided. In accord with Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U. S. 314 (1987), and James B. Beam Distilling Co. v. Georgia, 501 U. S. 529 (1991), we hold that this Court's application of a rule of federal law to the parties before the Court requires every court to give retroactive effect to that decision. We therefore reverse.\\n\\nI\\nThe Michigan tax scheme at issue in Davis \"exempt[ed] from taxation all retirement benefits paid by the State or its political subdivisions, but levie[d] an income tax on retirement benefits paid by . . . the Federal Government.\" 489 U. S., at 805. We held that the United States had not consented under 4 U. S. C. § 111[1] to this discriminatory imposition of a heavier tax burden on federal benefits than on state and local benefits. 489 U. S., at 808-817. Because Michigan \"conceded that a refund [was] appropriate,\" we recognized that federal retirees were entitled to a refund of taxes \"paid. . . pursuant to this invalid tax scheme.\" Id., at 817.[2]\\nLike Michigan, Virginia exempted state and local employees' retirement benefits from state income taxation while taxing federal retirement benefits. Va. Code Ann. § 58.1 322(c)(3) (Supp. 1988). In response to Davis, Virginia repealed its exemption for state and local government employees. 1989 Va. Acts, Special Sess. II, ch. 3. It also enacted a special statute of limitations for refund claims made in light of Davis. Under this statute, taxpayers may seek a refund *91 of state taxes imposed on federal retirement benefits in 1985, 1986, 1987, and 1988 for up to one year from the date of the final judicial resolution of whether Virginia must refund these taxes. Va. Code Ann. § 58.1-1823(b) (Supp. 1992).[3]\\nPetitioners, 421 federal civil service and military retirees, sought a refund of taxes \"erroneously or improperly assessed\" in violation of Davis ` nondiscrimination principle. Va. Code Ann. § 58.1-1826 (1991). The trial court denied relief. Law No. CL891080 (Va. Cir. Ct., Mar. 12, 1990). Applying the factors set forth in Chevron Oil Co. v. Huson, supra, at 106-107,[4] the court reasoned that \"Davis decided an issue of first impression whose resolution was not clearly foreshadowed,\" that \"prospective application of Davis will not retard its operation,\" and that \"retroactive application would result in inequity, injustice and hardship.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 20a.\\nThe Supreme Court of Virginia affirmed. Harper v. Virginia Dept. of Taxation, 241 Va. 232, 401 S. E. 2d 868 (1991). It too concluded, after consulting Chevron and the plurality opinion in American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith, 496 U. S. 167 (1990), that \"the Davis decision is not to be applied retroactively.\" 241 Va., at 240, 401 S. E. 2d, at 873. The court also rejected petitioners' contention that \"refunds *92 [were] due as a matter of state law.\" Ibid. It concluded that \"because the Davis decision is not to be applied retroactively, the pre-Davis assessments were neither erroneous nor improper\" under Virginia's tax refund statute. Id., at 241, 401 S. E. 2d, at 873. As a matter of Virginia law, the court held, a \"ruling declaring a taxing scheme unconstitutional is to be applied prospectively only.\" Ibid. This rationale supplied \"another reason\" for refusing relief. Ibid. \\nEven as the Virginia courts were denying relief to petitioners, we were confronting a similar retroactivity problem in James B. Beam Distilling Co. v. Georgia, 501 U. S. 529 (1991). At issue was Bacchus Imports, Ltd. v. Dias, 468 U. S. 263 (1984), which prohibited States from imposing higher excise taxes on imported alcoholic beverages than on local products. The Supreme Court of Georgia had used the analysis described in Chevron Oil Co. v. Huson to deny retroactive effect to a decision of this Court. Six Members of this Court disagreed, concluding instead that Bacchus must be applied retroactively to claims arising from facts predating that decision. Beam, 501 U. S., at 532 (opinion of Souter, J.); id., at 544-545 (White, J., concurring in judgment); id., at 547-548 (Blackmun, J., concurring in judgment); id., at 548-549 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment). After deciding Beam, we vacated the judgment in Harper and remanded for further consideration. 501 U. S. 1247 (1991).\\nOn remand, the Supreme Court of Virginia again denied tax relief. 242 Va. 322, 410 S. E. 2d 629 (1991). It reasoned that because Michigan did not contest the Davis plaintiffs' entitlement to a refund, this Court \"made no . . . ruling\" regarding the retroactive application of its rule \"to the litigants in that case.\" 242 Va., at 326, 410 S. E. 2d, at 631. Concluding that Beam did not foreclose application of Chevron `s retroactivity analysis because \"the retroactivity issue was not decided in Davis, \" 242 Va., at 326, 410 S. E. 2d, at *93 631, the court \"reaffirm[ed] [its] prior decision in all respects,\" id., at 327, 410 S. E. 2d, at 632.\\nWhen we decided Davis, 23 States gave preferential tax treatment to benefits received by employees of state and local governments relative to the tax treatment of benefits received by federal employees.[5] Like the Supreme Court of Virginia, several other state courts have refused to accord full retroactive effect to Davis as a controlling statement of federal law.[6] Two of the courts refusing to apply Davis  retroactively have done so after this Court remanded for reconsideration in light of Beam. See Bass v. South Carolina, 501 U. S. 1246 (1991); Harper v. Virginia Dept. of Taxation, 501 U. S. 1247 (1991); Lewy v. Virginia Dept. of Taxation,  decided with Harper v. Virginia Dept. of Taxation, 501 U. S. 1247 (1991). By contrast, the Supreme Court of Arkansas has concluded as a matter of federal law that Davis applies retroactively. Pledger v. Bosnick, 306 Ark. 45, 54-56, 811 S. W. 2d 286, 292-293 (1991), cert. pending, No. 91-375. Cf. Reich v. Collins, 262 Ga. 625, 422 S. E. 2d 846 (1992) *94 (holding that Davis applies retroactively but reasoning that state law precluded a refund), cert. pending, Nos. 92-1276 and 92-1453.[7]\\nAfter the Supreme Court of Virginia reaffirmed its original decision, we granted certiorari a second time. 504 U. S. 907 (1992). We now reverse.\\n\\nII\\n\"[B]oth the common law and our own decisions\" have \"recognized a general rule of retrospective effect for the constitutional decisions of this Court.\" Robinson v. Neil, 409 U. S. 505, 507 (1973). Nothing in the Constitution alters the fundamental rule of \"retrospective operation\" that has governed \"[j]udicial decisions . . . for near a thousand years.\" Kuhn v. Fairmont Coal Co., 215 U. S. 349, 372 (1910) (Holmes, J., dissenting). In Linkletter v. Walker, 381 U. S. 618 (1965), however, we developed a doctrine under which we could deny retroactive effect to a newly announced rule of criminal law. Under Linkletter, a decision to confine a new rule to prospective application rested on the purpose of the new rule, the reliance placed upon the previous view of the law, and \"the effect on the administration of justice of a retrospective application\" of the new rule. Id., at 636 (limiting Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S. 643 (1961)).[8] In the civil context, we similarly permitted the denial of retroactive effect to \"a new principle of law\" if such a limitation would avoid \"`injustice or hardship'\" without unduly undermining the \"purpose *95 and effect\" of the new rule. Chevron Oil Co. v. Huson, 404 U. S., at 106-107 (quoting Cipriano v. City of Houma, 395 U. S. 701, 706 (1969)).[9]\\nWe subsequently overruled Linkletter in Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U. S. 314 (1987), and eliminated limits on retroactivity in the criminal context by holding that all \"newly declared . . . rule[s]\" must be applied retroactively to all \"criminal cases pending on direct review.\" Id., at 322. This holding rested on two \"basic norms of constitutional adjudication.\" Ibid. First, we reasoned that \"the nature of judicial review\" strips us of the quintessentially \"legislat[ive]\" prerogative to make rules of law retroactive or prospective as we see fit. Ibid. Second, we concluded that \"selective application of new rules violates the principle of treating similarly situated [parties] the same.\" Id., at 323.\\nDicta in Griffith, however, stated that \"civil retroactivity. . . . continue[d] to be governed by the standard announced in Chevron Oil. \" Id., at 322, n. 8. We divided over the meaning of this dicta in American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith, 496 U. S. 167 (1990). The four Justices in the plurality used \"the Chevron Oil test\" to consider whether to confine \"the application of [American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Scheiner, 483 U. S. 266 (1987),] to taxation of highway use prior to June 23, 1987, the date we decided Scheiner. \" Id., *96 at 179 (opinion of O'Connor, J., joined by Rehnquist, C. J., and White and Kennedy, JJ.). Four other Justices rejected the plurality's \"anomalous approach\" to retroactivity and declined to hold that \"the law applicable to a particular case is that law which the parties believe in good faith to be applicable to the case.\" Id., at 219 (Stevens, J., dissenting, joined by Brennan, Marshall, and Blackmun, JJ.). Finally, despite concurring in the judgment, Justice Scalia \"share[d]\" the dissent's \"perception that prospective decisionmaking is incompatible with the judicial role.\" Id., at 201.\\nGriffith and American Trucking thus left unresolved the precise extent to which the presumptively retroactive effect of this Court's decisions may be altered in civil cases. But we have since adopted a rule requiring the retroactive application of a civil decision such as Davis. Although James B. Beam Distilling Co. v. Georgia, 501 U. S. 529 (1991), did not produce a unified opinion for the Court, a majority of Justices agreed that a rule of federal law, once announced and applied to the parties to the controversy, must be given full retroactive effect by all courts adjudicating federal law. In announcing the judgment of the Court, Justice Souter laid down a rule for determining the retroactive effect of a civil decision: After the case announcing any rule of federal law has \"appl[ied] that rule with respect to the litigants\" before the court, no court may \"refuse to apply [that] rule . . . retroactively.\" Id., at 540 (opinion of Souter, J., joined by Stevens, J.). Justice Souter's view of retroactivity superseded \"any claim based on a Chevron Oil analysis.\" Ibid.  Justice White likewise concluded that a decision \"extending the benefit of the judgment\" to the winning party \"is to be applied to other litigants whose cases were not final at the time of the [first] decision.\" Id., at 544 (opinion concurring in judgment). Three other Justices agreed that \"our judicial responsibility . . . requir[es] retroactive application of each . . . rule we announce.\" Id., at 548 (Blackmun, J., *97 joined by Marshall and Scalia, JJ., concurring in judgment). See also id., at 548-549 (Scalia, J., joined by Marshall and Blackmun, JJ., concurring in judgment).\\nBeam controls this case, and we accordingly adopt a rule that fairly reflects the position of a majority of Justices in Beam: When this Court applies a rule of federal law to the parties before it, that rule is the controlling interpretation of federal law and must be given full retroactive effect in all cases still open on direct review and as to all events, regardless of whether such events predate or postdate our announcement of the rule. This rule extends Griffith `s ban against \"selective application of new rules.\" 479 U. S., at 323. Mindful of the \"basic norms of constitutional adjudication\" that animated our view of retroactivity in the criminal context, id., at 322, we now prohibit the erection of selective temporal barriers to the application of federal law in noncriminal cases. In both civil and criminal cases, we can scarcely permit \"the substantive law [to] shift and spring\" according to \"the particular equities of [individual parties'] claims\" of actual reliance on an old rule and of harm from a retroactive application of the new rule. Beam, supra, at 543 (opinion of Souter, J.). Our approach to retroactivity heeds the admonition that \"[t]he Court has no more constitutional authority in civil cases than in criminal cases to disregard current law or to treat similarly situated litigants differently.\" American Trucking, supra, at 214 (Stevens, J., dissenting).\\nThe Supreme Court of Virginia \"appl[ied] the threepronged Chevron Oil test in deciding the retroactivity issue\" presented by this litigation. 242 Va., at 326, 410 S. E. 2d, at 631. When this Court does not \"reserve the question whether its holding should be applied to the parties before it,\" however, an opinion announcing a rule of federal law \"is properly understood to have followed the normal rule of retroactive application\" and must be \"read to hold . . . that its rule should apply retroactively to the litigants then before *98 the Court.\" Beam, 501 U. S., at 539 (opinion of Souter, J.). Accord, id., at 544-545 (White, J., concurring in judgment); id., at 550 (O'Connor, J., dissenting). Furthermore, the legal imperative \"to apply a rule of federal law retroactively after the case announcing the rule has already done so\" must \"prevai[l] over any claim based on a Chevron Oil analysis.\" Id., at 540 (opinion of Souter, J.).\\nIn an effort to distinguish Davis, the Supreme Court of Virginia surmised that this Court had \"made no . . . ruling\" about the application of the rule announced in Davis \"retroactively to the litigants in that case.\" 242 Va., at 326, 410 S. E. 2d, at 631. \"[B]ecause the retroactivity issue was not decided in Davis, \" the court believed that it was \"not foreclosed by precedent from applying the three-pronged Chevron Oil test in deciding the retroactivity issue in the present case.\" Ibid. \\nWe disagree. Davis did not hold that preferential state tax treatment of state and local employee pensions, though constitutionally invalid in the future, should be upheld as to all events predating the announcement of Davis. The governmental appellee in Davis \"conceded that a refund [would have been] appropriate\" if we were to conclude that \"the Michigan Income Tax Act violate[d] principles of intergovernmental tax immunity by favoring retired state and local governmental employees over retired federal employees.\" 489 U. S., at 817. We stated that \"to the extent appellant has paid taxes pursuant to this invalid tax scheme, he is entitled to a refund.\" Ibid. Far from reserving the retroactivity question, our response to the appellee's concession constituted a retroactive application of the rule announced in Davis to the parties before the Court. Because a decision to accord solely prospective effect to Davis would have foreclosed any discussion of remedial issues, our \"consideration of remedial issues\" meant \"necessarily\" that we retroactively applied the rule we announced in Davis to the litigants before us. Beam, supra, at 539 (opinion of Souter, J.). *99 Therefore, under Griffith, Beam, and the retroactivity approach we adopt today, the Supreme Court of Virginia must apply Davis in petitioners' refund action.\\n\\nIII\\nRespondent Virginia Department of Taxation defends the judgment below as resting on an independent and adequate state ground that relieved the Supreme Court of Virginia of any obligation to apply Davis to events occurring before our announcement of that decision. Petitioners had contended that \"even if the Davis decision applie[d] prospectively only,\" they were entitled to relief under Virginia's tax refund statute, Va. Code Ann. § 58.1-1826 (1991). Harper v. Virginia Dept. of Taxation, 241 Va., at 241, 401 S. E. 2d, at 873. The Virginia court rejected their argument. It first reasoned that because Davis did not apply retroactively, tax assessments predating Davis were \"neither erroneous nor improper within the meaning\" of Virginia's tax statute. Ibid.  The court then offered \"another reason\" for rejecting petitioners' \"state-law contention\": \"We previously have held that this Court's ruling declaring a taxing scheme unconstitutional is to be applied prospectively only.\" Ibid. (citing Perkins v. Albemarle County, 214 Va. 240, 198 S. E. 2d 626, aff'd and modified on rehearing, 214 Va. 416, 200 S. E. 2d 566 (1973); Capehart v. City of Chesapeake, No. 5459 (Va. Cir. Ct., Oct. 16, 1974), appeal denied, 215 Va. xlvii, cert. denied, 423 U. S. 875 (1975)). The formulation of this state-law retroactivity doctrinethat \"consideration should be given to the purpose of the new rule, the extent of the reliance on the old rule, and the effect on the administration of justice of a retroactive application of the new rule,\" Fountain v. Fountain, 214 Va. 347, 348, 200 S. E. 2d 513, 514 (1973), cert. denied, 416 U. S. 939 (1974), quoted in 241 Va., at 241, 401 S. E. 2d, at 874suggests that the Supreme Court of Virginia has simply incorporated into state law the threepronged analysis of Chevron Oil, 404 U. S., at 106-107, and *100 the criminal retroactivity cases overruled by Griffith, see, e. g., Stovall v. Denno, 388 U. S. 293, 297 (1967).\\nWe reject the department's defense of the decision below. The Supremacy Clause, U. S. Const., Art. VI, cl. 2, does not allow federal retroactivity doctrine to be supplanted by the invocation of a contrary approach to retroactivity under state law. Whatever freedom state courts may enjoy to limit the retroactive operation of their own interpretations of state law, see Great Northern R. Co. v. Sunburst Oil &amp; Refining Co., 287 U. S. 358, 364-366 (1932), cannot extend to their interpretations of federal law. See National Mines Corp. v. Caryl, 497 U. S. 922, 923 (1990) (per curiam); Ashland Oil, Inc. v. Caryl, 497 U. S. 916, 917 (1990) (per curiam). \\nWe also decline the Department of Taxation's invitation to affirm the judgment as resting on the independent and adequate ground that Virginia's law of remedies offered no \"retrospective refund remedy for taxable years concluded before Davis \" was announced. Brief for Respondent 33. The Virginia Supreme Court's conclusion that the challenged tax assessments were \"neither erroneous nor improper within the meaning\" of the refund statute rested solely on the court's determination that Davis did not apply retroactively. Harper v. Virginia Dept. of Taxation, supra, at 241, 401 S. E. 2d, at 873.\\nBecause we have decided that Davis applies retroactively to the tax years at issue in petitioners' refund action, we reverse the judgment below. We do not enter judgment for petitioners, however, because federal law does not necessarily entitle them to a refund. Rather, the Constitution requires Virginia \"to provide relief consistent with federal due process principles.\" American Trucking, 496 U. S., at 181 (plurality opinion). Under the Due Process Clause, U. S. Const., Amdt. 14, § 1, \"a State found to have imposed an impermissibly discriminatory tax retains flexibility in responding to this determination.\" McKesson Corp. v. Division of *101 Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco, Fla. Dept. of Business Regulation, 496 U. S. 18, 39-40 (1990). If Virginia \"offers a meaningful opportunity for taxpayers to withhold contested tax assessments and to challenge their validity in a predeprivation hearing,\" the \"availability of a predeprivation hearing constitutes a procedural safeguard . . . sufficient by itself to satisfy the Due Process Clause.\" Id., at 38, n. 21. On the other hand, if no such predeprivation remedy exists, \"the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment obligates the State to provide meaningful backward-looking relief to rectify any unconstitutional deprivation.\" Id. , at 31 (footnotes omitted).[10] In providing such relief, a State may either award full refunds to those burdened by an unlawful tax or issue some other order that \"create[s] in hindsight a nondiscriminatory scheme.\" Id., at 40. Cf. Davis, 489 U. S., at 818 (suggesting that a State's failure to respect intergovernmental tax immunity could be cured \"either by extending [a discriminatory] tax exemption to retired federal employees . . . or by eliminating the exemption for retired state and local government employees\").\\nThe constitutional sufficiency of any remedy thus turns (at least initially) on whether Virginia law \"provide[s] a[n] [adequate] form of `predeprivation process,' for example, by authorizing taxpayers to bring suit to enjoin imposition of a tax *102 prior to its payment, or by allowing taxpayers to withhold payment and then interpose their objections as defenses in a tax enforcement proceeding.\" McKesson, 496 U. S., at 3637. Because this issue has not been properly presented, we leave to Virginia courts this question of state law and the performance of other tasks pertaining to the crafting of any appropriate remedy. Virginia \"is free to choose which form of relief it will provide, so long as that relief satisfies the minimum federal requirements we have outlined.\" Id., at 51-52. State law may provide relief beyond the demands of federal due process, id., at 52, n. 36, but under no circumstances may it confine petitioners to a lesser remedy, see id.,  at 44-51.\\n\\nIV\\nWe reverse the judgment of the Supreme Court of Virginia, and we remand the case for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\\nSo ordered.\\nJustice Scalia, concurring.\\nI am surprised to see an appeal to stare decisis in today's dissent. In Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989), Justice O'Connor wrote for a plurality that openly rejected settled precedent controlling the scope of retroactivity on collateral review. \"This retroactivity determination,\" the opinion said, \"would normally entail application of the Linkletter [v. Walker, 381 U. S. 618 (1965),] standard, but we believe that our approach to retroactivity for cases on collateral review requires modification.\" Id., at 301. The dissent in Teague  was a sort of anticipatory echo of today's dissent, criticizing the plurality for displaying \"infidelity to the doctrine of stare decisis,\" id., at 331 (Brennan, J., dissenting), for \"upset[ting]. . . our time-honored precedents,\" id., at 333, for \"repudiating our familiar approach without regard for the doctrine of stare decisis,\" id., at 345, and for failing \"so much as [to] mention stare decisis,\" id., at 333.\\n*103 I joined the plurality opinion in Teague. Not only did I believe the rule it announced was correct, see Withrow v. Williams, 507 U. S. 680, 717 (1993) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part), but I also believed that abandonment of our prior collateral-review retroactivity rule was fully in accord with the doctrine of stare decisis, which as applied by our Court has never been inflexible. The Teague  plurality opinion set forth good reasons for abandoning Linkletter reasons justifying a similar abandonment of Chevron Oil Co. v. Huson, 404 U. S. 97 (1971). It noted, for example, that Linkletter \"ha[d] not led to consistent results,\" Teague, supra, at 302; but neither has Chevron Oil. Proof that what it means is in the eye of the beholder is provided quite nicely by the separate opinions filed today: Of the four Justices who would still apply Chevron Oil, two find Davis v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury, 489 U. S. 803 (1989), retroactive, see post,  at 111 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment), two find it not retroactive, see post, at 122 (O'Connor, J., dissenting). Second, the Teague plurality opinion noted that Linkletter had been criticized by commentators, Teague, supra, at 303; but the commentary cited in the opinion criticized not just Linkletter, but the Court's retroactivity jurisprudence in general, of which it considered Chevron Oil an integral part, see Beytagh, Ten Years of Non-Retroactivity: A Critique and a Proposal, 61 Va. L. Rev. 1557, 1558, 1581-1582, 1606 (1975). Other commentary, of course, has also regarded the issue of retroactivity as a general problem of jurisprudence. See, e. g., Fallon &amp; Meltzer, New Law, Non-Retroactivity, and Constitutional Remedies, 104 Harv. L. Rev. 1731 (1991); Schaefer, Prospective Rulings: Two Perspectives, 1982 S. Ct. Rev. 1; Schaefer, The Control of \"Sunbursts\": Techniques of Prospective Overruling, 42 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 631 (1967); Mishkin, Forward: The High Court, The Great Writ, and the Due Process of Time and Law, 79 Harv. L. Rev. 56, 58-72 (1965).\\n*104 Finally, the plurality opinion in Teague justified the departure from Linkletter by implicitly relying on the well-settled proposition that stare decisis has less force where intervening decisions \"have removed or weakened the conceptual underpinnings from the prior decision.\" Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U. S. 164, 173 (1989). Justice O'Connor endorsed the reasoning expressed by Justice Harlan in his separate opinions in Mackey v. United States, 401 U. S. 667 (1971), and Desist v. United States, 394 U. S. 244 (1969), and noted that the Court had already adopted the first part of Justice Harlan's retroactivity views in Griffith  v. Kentucky, 479 U. S. 314 (1987). See Teague, supra, at 303-305. Again, this argument equallyindeed, even more forcefullysupports reconsideration of Chevron Oil. Griffith returned this Court, in criminal cases, to the traditional view (which I shall discuss at greater length below) that prospective decisionmaking \"violates basic norms of constitutional adjudication.\" Griffith, supra, at 322. One of the conceptual underpinnings of Chevron Oil was that retroactivity presents a similar problem in both civil and criminal contexts. See Chevron Oil, supra, at 106; see also Beytagh, supra, at 1606. Thus, after Griffith, Chevron Oil can be adhered to only by rejecting the reasoning of Chevron Oil  that is, only by asserting that the issue of retroactivity is different in the civil and criminal settings. That is a particularly difficult proof to make, inasmuch as Griffith rested on \"basic norms of constitutional adjudication\" and \"the nature of judicial review.\" 479 U. S., at 322; see also Teague, supra, at 317 (White, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (Griffith \"appear[s] to have constitutional underpinnings\").[1]\\n*105 What most provokes comment in the dissent, however, is not its insistence that today a rigid doctrine of stare decisis  forbids tinkering with retroactivity, which four Terms ago did not; but rather the irony of its invoking stare decisis in defense of prospective decisionmaking at all. Prospective decisionmaking is the handmaid of judicial activism, and the born enemy of stare decisis. It was formulated in the heyday of legal realism and promoted as a \"techniqu[e] of judicial lawmaking\" in general, and more specifically as a means of making it easier to overrule prior precedent. B. Levy, Realist Jurisprudence and Prospective Overruling, *106 109 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1 (1960). Thus, the dissent is saying, in effect, that stare decisis demands the preservation of methods of destroying stare decisis recently invented in violation of stare decisis. \\nContrary to the dissent's assertion that Chevron Oil articulated \"our traditional retroactivity analysis,\" post, at 113, the jurisprudence it reflects \"came into being,\" as Justice Harlan observed, less than 30 years ago with Linkletter v. Walker, 381 U. S. 618 (1965). Mackey, supra, at 676. It is so unancient that one of the current Members of this Court was sitting when it was invented. The true traditional  view is that prospective decisionmaking is quite incompatible with the judicial power, and that courts have no authority to engage in the practice. See ante, at 94; James B. Beam Distilling Co. v. Georgia, 501 U. S. 529, 534 (1991) (opinion of Souter, J.); American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith, 496 U. S. 167, 201 (1990) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment); Desist, supra, at 258-259 (Harlan, J., dissenting); Great Northern R. Co. v. Sunburst Oil &amp; Refining Co., 287 U. S. 358, 365 (1932). Linkletter itself recognized that \"[a]t common law there was no authority for the proposition that judicial decisions made law only for the future.\" 381 U. S., at 622-623. And before Linkletter, the academic proponents of prospective judicial decisionmaking acknowledged that their proposal contradicted traditional practice. See, e. g.,  Levy, supra, at 2, and n. 2; Carpenter, Court Decisions and the Common Law, 17 Colum. L. Rev. 593, 594 (1917). Indeed, the roots of the  contrary tradition are so deep that Justice Holmes was prepared to hazard the guess that \"[j]udicial decisions have had retrospective operation for near a thousand years.\" Kuhn v. Fairmont Coal Co., 215 U. S. 349, 372 (1910) (dissenting opinion).\\nJustice O'Connor asserts that \"`[w]hen the Court changes its mind, the law changes with it.' \" Post, at 115 (quoting Beam, supra, at 550 (O'Connor, J., dissenting)). That concept is quite foreign to the American legal and constitutional *107 tradition. It would have struck John Marshall as an extraordinary assertion of raw power. The conception of the judicial role that he possessed, and that was shared by succeeding generations of American judges until very recent times, took it to be \"the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is, \" Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 177 (1803) (emphasis added)not what the law shall be. That original and enduring American perception of the judicial role sprang not from the philosophy of Nietzsche but from the jurisprudence of Blackstone, which viewed retroactivity as an inherent characteristic of the judicial power, a power \"not delegated to pronounce a new law, but to maintain and expound the old one.\" 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries 69 (1765). Even when a \"former determination is most evidently contrary to reason . . . [or] contrary to the divine law,\" a judge overruling that decision would \"not pretend to make a new law, but to vindicate the old one from misrepresentation.\" Id., at 69-70. \"For if it be found that the former decision is manifestly absurd or unjust, it is declared, not that such a sentence was bad law, but that it was not law. \" Id., at 70 (emphases in original). Fully retroactive decisionmaking was considered a principal distinction between the judicial and the legislative power: \"[I]t is said that that which distinguishes a judicial from a legislative act is, that the one is a determination of what the existing law is in relation to some existing thing already done or happened, while the other is a predetermination of what the law shall be for the regulation of all future cases.\" T. Cooley, Constitutional Limitations *91. The critics of the traditional rule of full retroactivity were well aware that it was grounded in what one of them contemptuously called \"another fiction known as the Separation of powers.\" Kocourek, Retrospective Decisions and Stare Decisis and a Proposal, 17 A. B. A. J. 180, 181 (1931).\\nProspective decisionmaking was known to foe and friend alike as a practical tool of judicial activism, born out of disregard *108 for stare decisis. In the eyes of its enemies, the doctrine \"smack[ed] of the legislative process,\" Mishkin, 79 Harv. L. Rev., at 65, \"encroach[ed] on the prerogatives of the legislative department of government,\" Von Moschzisker, Stare Decisis in Courts of Last Resort, 37 Harv. L. Rev. 409, 428 (1924), removed \"one of the great inherent restraints upon this Court's depart[ing] from the field of interpretation to enter that of lawmaking,\" James v. United States, 366 U. S. 213, 225 (1961) (Black, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part), caused the Court's behavior to become \"assimilated to that of a legislature,\" Kurland, Toward a Political Supreme Court, 37 U. Chi. L. Rev. 19, 34 (1969), and tended \"to cut [the courts] loose from the force of precedent, allowing [them] to restructure artificially those expectations legitimately created by extant law and thereby mitigate the practical force of stare decisis, \" Mackey, 401 U. S., at 680 (Harlan, J., concurring in judgment). All this was not denied by the doctrine's friends, who also viewed it as a device to \"augmen[t] the power of the courts to contribute to the growth of the law in keeping with the demands of society,\" Mallamud, Prospective Limitation and the Rights of the Accused, 56 Iowa L. Rev. 321, 359 (1970), as \"a deliberate and conscious technique of judicial lawmaking,\" Levy, 109 U. Pa. L. Rev., at 6, as a means of \"facilitating more effective and defensible judicial lawmaking,\" id., at 28.\\nJustice Harlan described this Court's embrace of the prospectivity principle as \"the product of the Court's disquietude with the impacts of its fast-moving pace of constitutional innovation,\" Mackey, supra, at 676. The Court itself, however, glowingly described the doctrine as the cause rather than the effect of innovation, extolling it as a \"technique\" providing the \"impetus . . . for the implementation of long overdue reforms.\" Jenkins v. Delaware, 395 U. S. 213, 218 (1969). Whether cause or effect, there is no doubt that the era which gave birth to the prospectivity principle was marked by a newfound disregard for stare decisis. As one *109 commentator calculated, \"[b]y 1959, the number of instances in which the Court had reversals involving constitutional issues had grown to sixty; in the two decades which followed, the Court overruled constitutional cases on no less than forty-seven occasions.\" Maltz, Some Thoughts on the Death of Stare Decisis in Constitutional Law, 1980 Wis. L. Rev. 467. It was an era when this Court cast overboard numerous settled decisions, and indeed even whole areas of law, with an unceremonious \"heave-ho.\" See, e. g., Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S. 643 (1961) (overruling Wolf v. Colorado, 338 U. S. 25 (1949)); Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335 (1963) (overruling Betts v. Brady, 316 U. S. 455 (1942)); Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, 479, n. 48 (1966) (overruling Crooker v. California, 357 U. S. 433 (1958), and Cicenia v. Lagay, 357 U. S. 504 (1958)); Katz v. United States, 389 U. S. 347 (1967) (overruling Olmstead v. United States, 277 U. S. 438 (1928), and Goldman v. United States, 316 U. S. 129 (1942)). To argue now that one of the jurisprudential tools of judicial activism from that period should be extended on grounds of stare decisis  can only be described as paradoxical.[2]\\nIn sum, I join the opinion of the Court because the doctrine of prospective decisionmaking is not in fact protected *110 by our flexible rule of stare decisis; and because no friend of stare decisis would want it to be.\\nJustice Kennedy, with whom Justice White joins, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.\\nI remain of the view that it is sometimes appropriate in the civil context to give only prospective application to a judicial decision. \"[P]rospective overruling allows courts to respect the principle of stare decisis even when they are impelled to change the law in light of new understanding.\" American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith, 496 U. S. 167, 197 (1990) (plurality opinion). When a court promulgates a new rule of law, prospective application functions \"to avoid injustice or hardship to civil litigants who have justifiably relied on prior law.\" Id., at 199 (internal quotation marks omitted). See Phoenix v. Kolodziejski, 399 U. S. 204, 213-215 (1970); Cipriano v. City of Houma, 395 U. S. 701, 706 (1969) (per curiam); England v. Louisiana Bd. of Medical Examiners, 375 U. S. 411, 422 (1964). And in my view retroactivity in civil cases continues to be governed by the standard announced in Chevron Oil Co. v. Huson, 404 U. S. 97, 106-107 (1971). Thus, for the reasons explained by Justice O'Connor, post, at 113-117, I cannot agree with the Court's broad dicta, ante, at 95-97, that appears to embrace in the civil context the retroactivity principles adopted for criminal cases in Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U. S. 314 (1987). As Justice O'Connor has demonstrated elsewhere, the differences between the civil and criminal contexts counsel strongly against adoption of Griffith for civil cases. See American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith, supra, at 197-199. I also cannot accept the Court's conclusion, ante, at 96-99, which is based on Justice Souter's opinion in James B. Beam Distilling Co. v. Georgia, 501 U. S. 529, 540-543 (1991), that a decision of this Court must be applied in a retroactive manner simply because the rule of law there announced happened to be applied to the parties then before the Court. *111 See post, at 117-122 (O'Connor, J.,dissenting); James B. Beam Distilling Co. v. Georgia, supra, at 550-552 (O'Connor, J., dissenting). For these reasons, I do not join Part II of the Court's opinion.\\nI nonetheless agree with the Court that Davis v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury, 489 U. S. 803 (1989), must be given retroactive effect. The first condition for prospective application of any decision is that itmust announce a new rule of law. Ashland Oil, Inc. v. Caryl, 497 U. S. 916, 918 (1990) (per curiam); American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith, supra,  at 179; United States v. Johnson, 457 U. S. 537, 550, n. 12 (1982); Chevron Oil Co. v. Huson, 404 U. S., at 106-107. The decision must \"overrul[e] clear past precedent on which litigants may have relied\" or \"decid[e] an issue of first impression whose resolution was not clearly foreshadowed.\" Id. , at 106. Because Davis did neither, it did not announce new law and therefore must be applied in a retroactive manner.\\nRespondent argues that two new principles of law were established in Davis. First, it points to the holding that 4 U. S. C. § 111, in which the United States consents to state taxation of the compensation of \"an officer or employee of the United States,\" applies to federal retirees as well as current federal employees. Brief for Respondent 16-18. See Davis, 489 U. S., at 808-810. In Davis, however, we indicated that this holding was \"dictate[d]\" by \"the plain language of the statute,\" id., at 808, and we added for good measure our view that the language of the statute was \"unambiguous,\" \"unmistakable,\" and \"leaves no room for doubt,\" id., at 809, n. 3, 810. Given these characterizations, it is quite implausible to contend that in this regard Davis  decided \"an issue of first impression whose resolution was not clearly foreshadowed.\" Chevron Oil, supra, at 106.\\nThe second new rule respondent contends the Court announced in Davis was that the state statute at issue discriminated against federal retirees even though the statute treated them like all other state taxpayers except state employees. *112 Brief for Respondent 18-26. See Davis, supra, at 814, 815, n. 4. The Davis Court, however, anchored its decision in precedent. We observed that in Phillips Chemical Co. v. Dumas Independent School Dist., 361 U. S. 376 (1960), \"we faced th[e] precise situation\" confronting us in Davis,  and so Phillips Chemical controlled our holding. 489 U. S., at 815, n. 4. To be sure, Justice Stevens in dissent disagreed with these contentions and attempted to distinguish Phillips Chemical. 489 U. S., at 824-826. The Court, however, was not persuaded at the time, and I remain convinced that the Court had the better reading of Phillips Chemical.  A contrary holding in Davis, in my view, would have created a clear inconsistency in our jurisprudence. Under Chevron Oil, application of precedent which directly controls is not the stuff of which new law is made.\\nFar from being \"revolutionary,\" Ashland Oil Co. v. Caryl, supra, at 920, or \"an avulsive change which caused the current of the law thereafter to flow between new banks,\" Hanover Shoe, Inc. v. United Shoe Machinery Co., 392 U. S. 481, 499 (1968), Davis was a mere application of plain statutory language and existing precedent. In these circumstances, this Court is not free to mitigate any financial hardship that might befall Virginia's taxpayers as a result of their state government's failure to reach a correct understanding of the unambiguous dictates of federal law.\\nBecause I do not believe that Davis v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury, supra, announced a new principle of law, I have no occasion to consider Justice O'Connor's argument, post,  at 131-136, that equitable considerations may inform the formulation of remedies when a new rule is announced. In any event, I do not read Part III of the Court's opinion as saying anything inconsistent with what Justice O'Connor proposes.\\nOn this understanding, I join Parts I and III of the Court's opinion and concur in its judgment.\\n*113 Justice O'Connor, with whom The Chief Justice joins, dissenting.\\nToday the Court applies a new rule of retroactivity to impose crushing and unnecessary liability on the States, precisely at a time when they can least afford it. Were the Court's decision the product of statutory or constitutional command, I would have no choice but to join it. But nothing in the Constitution or statute requires us to adopt the retroactivity rule the majority now applies. In fact, longstanding precedent requires the opposite result. Because I see no reason to abandon our traditional retroactivity analysis as articulated in Chevron Oil Co. v. Huson, 404 U. S. 97, 106 107 (1971), and because I believe the Supreme Court of Virginia correctly applied Chevron Oil in this case, I would affirm the judgment below.\\n\\nI\\nThis Court's retroactivity jurisprudence has become somewhat chaotic in recent years. Three Terms ago, the case of American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith, 496 U. S. 167 (1990), produced three opinions, none of which garnered a majority. One Term later, James B. Beam Distilling Co. v. Georgia, 501 U. S. 529 (1991), yielded five opinions; there, no single writing carried more than three votes. As a result, the Court today finds itself confronted with such disarray that, rather than relying on precedent, it must resort to vote counting: Examining the various opinions in Jim Beam, it discerns six votes for a single proposition that, in its view, controls this case. Ante, at 96-97.\\nIf we had given appropriate weight to the principle of stare decisis in the first place, our retroactivity jurisprudence never would have become so hopelessly muddled. After all, it was not that long ago that the law of retroactivity for civil cases was considered well settled. In Chevron Oil Co. , we explained that whether a decision will be nonretroactive depends on whether it announces a new rule, whether prospectivity would undermine the purposes of the *114 rule, and whether retroactive application would produce injustice. 404 U. S., at 106-107. Even when this Court adjusted the retroactivity rule for criminal cases on direct review some six years ago, we reaffirmed the vitality of Chevron Oil, noting that retroactivity in civil cases \"continues to be governed by the standard announced in Chevron Oil Co. v. Huson. \" Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U. S. 314, 322, n. 8 (1987). In American Trucking Assns., supra, however, a number of Justices expressed a contrary view, and the jurisprudential equivalent of entropy immediately took over. Whatever the merits of any retroactivity test, it cannot be denied that resolution of the case before us would be simplified greatly had we not disregarded so needlessly our obligation to follow precedent in the first place.\\nI fear that the Court today, rather than rectifying that confusion, reinforces it still more. In the usual case, of course, retroactivity is not an issue; the courts simply apply their best understanding of current law in resolving each case that comes before them. James B. Beam, 501 U. S., at 534, 535-536 (Souter, J.). But where the law changes in some respect, the courts sometimes may elect not to apply the new law; instead, they apply the law that governed when the events giving rise to the suit took place, especially where the change in law is abrupt and the parties may have relied on the prior law. See id., at 534. This can be done in one of two ways. First, a court may choose to make the decision purely prospective, refusing to apply it not only to the parties before the court but also to any case where the relevant facts predate the decision. Id., at 536. Second, a court may apply the rule to some but not all cases where the operative events occurred before the court's decision, depending on the equities. See id., at 537. The first option is called \"pure prospectivity\" and the second \"selective prospectivity.\"\\nAs the majority notes, ante, at 96-97, six Justices in James B. Beam, supra, expressed their disagreement with selective prospectivity. Thus, even though there was no majority *115 opinion in that case, one can derive from that case the proposition the Court announces today: Once \"this Court applies a rule of federal law to the parties before it,that rule .. . must be given full retroactive effect in all cases still open on direct review.\" Ante, at 97. But no decision of this Court forecloses the possibility of pure prospectivityrefusal to apply a new rule in the very case in which it is announced and every case thereafter. As Justice White explained in his concurrence in James B. Beam, \"[t]he propriety of prospective application of decision in this Court, in both constitutional and statutory cases, is settled by our prior decisions.\" 501 U. S., at 546 (opinion concurring in judgment).\\nRather than limiting its pronouncements to the question of selective prospectivity, the Court intimates that pure prospectivity may be prohibited as well. See ante, at 97 (referring to our lack of \"`constitutional authority . . . to disregard current law' \"); ibid. (relying on \"`basic norms of constitutional adjudication' \" (quoting Griffith, supra, at 322)); see also ante, at 94 (touting the \"fundamental rule of `retrospective operation' \" of judicial decisions). The intimation is incorrect. As I have explained before and will touch upon only briefly here:\\n\"[W]hen the Court changes its mind, the law changes with it. If the Court decides, in the context of a civil case or controversy, to change the law, it must make [a] determination whether the new law or the old is to apply to conduct occurring before the law-changing decision. Chevron Oil describes our long-established procedure for making this inquiry.\" James B. Beam, supra, at 550 (O'Connor, J., dissenting) (internal quotation marks omitted).\\nNor can the Court's suggestion be squared with our cases, which repeatedly have announced rules of purely prospective effect. See, e. g., Northern Pipeline Constr. Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co., 458 U. S. 50, 88 (1982); Chevron Oil, 404 *116 U. S., at 106-107; Phoenix v. Kolodziejski, 399 U. S. 204, 214 (1970); Cipriano v. City of Houma, 395 U. S. 701, 706 (1969); see also American Trucking Assns., 496 U. S., at 188-200 (plurality opinion) (canvassing the Court's retroactivity jurisprudence); ante, at 110 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (citing cases).\\nIn any event, the question of pure prospectivity is not implicated here. The majority first holds that once a rule has been applied retroactively, the rule must be applied retroactively to all cases thereafter. Ante, at 97. Then it holds that Davis v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury, 489 U. S. 803 (1989), in fact retroactively applied the rule it announced. Ante, at 98-99. Under the majority's approach, that should end the matter: Because the Court applied the rule retroactively in Davis, it must do so here as well. Accordingly, there is no reason for the Court's careless dictum regarding pure prospectivity, much less dictum that is contrary to clear precedent.\\nPlainly enough, Justice Scalia would cast overboard our entire retroactivity doctrine with precisely the \"unceremonious `heave-ho' \" he decries in his concurrence. See ante, at 109. Behind the undisguised hostility to an era whose jurisprudence he finds distasteful, Justice Scalia raises but two substantive arguments, both of which were raised in James B. Beam , 501 U. S., at 549 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment), and neither of which has been adopted by a majority of this Court. Justice White appropriately responded to those arguments then, see id., at 546 (opinion concurring in judgment), and there is no reason to repeat the responses now. As Justice Frankfurter explained more than 35 years ago:\\n\"We should not indulge in the fiction that the law now announced has always been the law . . . . It is much more conducive to law's self-respect to recognize candidly the considerations that give prospective content to *117 a new pronouncement of law.\" Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U. S. 12, 26 (1956) (opinion concurring in judgment).\\n\\nII\\nI dissented in James B. Beam because I believed that the absolute prohibition on selective prospectivity was not only contrary to precedent, but also so rigid that it produced unconscionable results. I would have adhered to the traditional equitable balancing test of Chevron Oil as the appropriate method of deciding the retroactivity question in individual cases. But even if one believes the prohibition on selective prospectivity desirable, it seems to me that the Court today takes that judgment to an illogicaland inequitableextreme. It is one thing to say that, where we have considered prospectivity in a prior case and rejected it, we must reject it in every case thereafter. But it is quite another to hold that, because we did not consider the possibility of prospectivity in a prior case and instead applied a rule retroactively through inadvertence, we are foreclosed from considering the issue forever thereafter. Such a rule is both contrary to established precedent and at odds with any notion of fairness or sound decisional practice. Yet that is precisely the rule the Court appears to adopt today. Ante, at 96-97.\\n\\nA\\nUnder the Court's new approach, we have neither authority nor discretion to consider the merits of applying Davis v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury, supra, retroactively. Instead, we must inquire whether any of our previous decisions happened to have applied the Davis rule retroactively to the parties before the Court. Deciding whether we in fact have applied Davis retroactively turns out to be a rather difficult matter. Parsing the language of the Davis opinion, the Court encounters a single sentence it declares determinative: \"The State having conceded that a refund is appropriate in *118 these circumstances, see Brief for Appellee 63, to the extent appellant has paid taxes pursuant to this invalid tax scheme, he is entitled to a refund.\" Id., at 817 (quoted in part, ante,  at 98). According to the majority, that sentence constitutes \"`consideration of remedial issues' \" and therefore \"`necessarily' \" indicates that we applied the rule in Davis retroactively to the parties before us. Ante, at 98 (quoting James B. Beam, supra, at 539 (opinion of Souter, J.)). Ironically, respondent and its amici draw precisely the opposite conclusion from the same sentence. According to them, the fact that Michigan conceded that it would offer relief meant that we had no reason to decide the question of retroactivity in Davis. Michigan was willing to provide relief whether or not relief was required. The Court simply accepted that offer and preserved the retroactivity question for another day.\\nOne might very well debate the meaning of the single sentence on which everyone relies. But the debate is as meaningless as it is indeterminate. In Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U. S. 619 (1993), we reaffirmed our longstanding rule that, if a decision does not \"squarely addres[s] [an] issue,\" this Court remains \"free to address [it] on the merits\" at a later date. Id., at 631. Accord, United States v. L. A. Tucker Truck Lines, Inc., 344 U. S. 33, 38 (1952) (issue not \"raised in briefs or argument nor discussed in the opinion of the Court\" cannot be taken as \"a binding precedent on th[e] point\"); Webster v. Fall, 266 U. S. 507, 511 (1925) (\"Questions which merely lurk in the record, neither brought to the attention of the court nor ruled upon, are not considered as having been so decided as to constitute precedents\"). The rule can be traced back to some of the earliest of this Court's decisions. See statement of Marshall, C. J.,as reported in the arguments of counsel in United States v. More, 3 Cranch 159, 172 (1805) (\"No question was made, in that case, as to the jurisdiction. It passed sub silentio, and the court does not consider itself as bound by that case\"). Regardless of *119 how one reads the solitary sentence upon which the Court relies, surely it does not \"squarely address\" the question of retroactivity; it does not even mention retroactivity. At best, by addressing the question of remedies, the sentence implicitly \"assumes\" the rule in Davis to be retroactive. Our decision in Brecht, however, makes it quite clear that unexamined assumptions do not bind this Court. Brecht, supra, at 631 (That the Court \"assumed the applicability of\" a rule does not bind the Court to the assumption).\\nIn fact, there is far less reason to consider ourselves bound by precedent today than there was in Brecht. In Brecht,  the issue was not whether a legal question was resolved by a single case; it was whether our consistent practice of applying a particular rule, Chapman v. California, 386 U. S. 18, 24 (1967), to cases on collateral review precluded us from limiting the rule's application to cases on direct review. Because none of our prior cases directly had addressed the applicability of Chapman to cases on collateral revieweach had only assumed it appliedthe Court held that those cases did not bind us to any particular result. See Brecht, supra,  at 630-631. I see no reason why a single retroactive application of the Davis rule, inferred from the sparse and ambiguous language of Davis itself, should carry more weight here than our consistent practice did in Brecht. \\nThe Court offers no justification for disregarding the settled rule we so recently applied in Brecht. Nor do I believe it could, for the rule is not a procedural nicety. On the contrary, it is critical to the soundness of our decisional processes. It should go without saying that any decision of this Court has wide-ranging applications; nearly every opinion we issue has effects far beyond the particular case in which it issues. The rule we applied in Brecht, which limits the stare decisis effect of our decisions to questions actually considered and passed on, ensures that this Court does not decide important questions by accident or inadvertence. By adopting a contrary rule in the area of retroactivity, the *120 Court now permanently binds itself to its every unexamined assumption or inattention. Any rule that creates a grave risk that we might resolve important issues of national concern sub silentio, without thought or consideration, cannot be a wise one.\\nThis case demonstrates the danger of such a rule. The question of retroactivity was never briefed in Davis. It had not been passed upon by the court below. And it was not within the question presented. Indeed, at oral argument we signaled that we would not pass upon the retroactivity of the rule Davis would announce. After conceding that the Michigan Department of Taxation would give Davis himself a refund if he prevailed, counsel for the department argued that it would be unfair to require Michigan to provide refunds to the 24,000 taxpayers who were not before the Court. The following colloquy ensued:\\n\"[Court]: So why do we have to answer that at all? \"[Michigan]: if, if this Court issues an opinion stating that the current Michigan classification is unconstitutional or in violation of the statute, there are these 24,000 taxpayers out there.. . . . .\\n\"[Court]: But that's notit's not here, is it? Is that question here?\\n\"[Michigan]: It is not specifically raised, no.\" Tr. of Oral Arg., O. T. 1988, No. 87-1020, pp. 37-38.\\nNow, however, the Court holds that the question was implicitly before us and that, even though the Davis opinion does not even discuss the question of retroactivity, it resolved the issue conclusively and irretrievably.\\nIf Davis somehow did decide that its rule was to be retroactive, it was by chance and not by design. The absence of briefing, argument, or even mention of the question belies any suggestion that the issue was given thoughtful consideration. Even the author of the Davis opinion refuses to accept *121 the notion that Davis resolved the question of retroactivity. Instead, Justice Kennedy applies the analysis of Chevron Oil to resolve the retroactivity question today. See ante, at 110-112 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment).\\nThe Court's decision today cannot be justified by comparison to our decision in Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U. S. 314 (1987), which abandoned selective prospectivity in the criminal context. Ante, at 97. As I explained in American Trucking Assns., 496 U. S., at 197-200, there are significant differences between criminal and civil cases that weigh against such an extension. First, nonretroactivity in criminal cases historically has favored the government's reliance interests over the rights of criminal defendants. As a result, the generalized policy of favoring individual rights over governmental prerogative can justify the elimination of prospectivity in the criminal arena. The same rationale cannot apply in civil cases, as nonretroactivity in the civil context does not necessarily favor plaintiffs or defendants; \"nor is there any policy reason for protecting one class of litigants over another.\" Id., at 198. More important, even a party to civil litigation who is \"deprived of the full retroactive benefit of a new decision may receive some relief.\" Id., at 198 199. Here, for example, petitioners received the benefit of prospective invalidation of Virginia's taxing scheme. From this moment forward, they will be treated on an equal basis with all other retirees, the very treatment our intergovernmental immunity cases require. The criminal defendant, in contrast, is usually interested only in one remedyreversal of his conviction. That remedy can be obtained only if the rule is applied retroactively. See id. , at 199.\\nNor can the Court's rejection of selective retroactivity in the civil context be defended on equal treatment grounds. See Griffith, supra, at 323 (selective retroactivity accords a benefit to the defendant in whose case the decision is announced but not to any defendant thereafter). It may well *122 be that there is little difference between the criminal defendant in whose case a decision is announced and the defendant who seeks certiorari on the same question two days later. But in this case there is a tremendous difference between the defendant in whose case the Davis rule was announced and the defendant who appears before us today: The latter litigated and preserved the retroactivity question while the former did not. The Michigan Department of Taxation did not even brief the question of retroactivity in Davis. Respondent, in contrast, actually prevailed on the question in the court below.\\nIf the Court is concerned with equal treatment, that difference should be dispositive. Having failed to demand the unusual, prospectivity, respondent in Davis got the usual namely, retroactivity. Respondent in this case has asked for the unusual. In fact, respondent here defends a judgment below that awarded it just that. I do not see how the principles of equality can support forcing the Commonwealth of Virginia to bear the harsh consequences of retroactivity simply because, years ago, the Michigan Department of Taxation failed to press the issueand we neglected to consider it. Instead, the principles of fairness favor addressing the contentions the Virginia Department of Taxation presses before us by applying Chevron Oil today. It is therefore to Chevron Oil that I now turn.\\n\\nB\\nUnder Chevron Oil, whether a decision of this Court will be applied nonretroactively depends on three factors. First, as a threshold matter, \"the decision to be applied nonretroactively must establish a new principle of law.\" 404 U. S., at 106. Second, nonretroactivity must not retard the new rule's operation in light of its history, purpose, and effect. Id., at 107. Third, nonretroactivity must be necessary to avoid the substantial injustice and hardship that a holding of retroactivity might impose. Ibid. In my view, all three factors favor holding our decision in Davis nonretroactive.\\n\\n\\n*123 1\\nAs Justice Kennedy points out in his concurrence, ante,  at 111, a decision cannot be made nonretroactive unless it announces \"a new principle of law.\" Chevron Oil, 404 U. S., at 106. For purposes of civil retroactivity, Chevron Oil  identifies two types of decisions that can be new. First, a decision is new if it overturns \"clear past precedent on which litigants may have relied.\" Ibid.; ante, at 111 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). I agree with Justice Kennedy that Davis did not represent such a \"`revolutionary' \" or \"`avulsive change' \" in the law. Ante,  at 112 (quoting Hanover Shoe, Inc. v. United Shoe Machinery Corp., 392 U. S. 481, 499 (1968)).\\nNonetheless, Chevron also explains that a decision may be \"new\" if it resolves \"an issue of first impression whose resolution was not clearly foreshadowed.\" Chevron Oil, supra,  at 106 (emphasis added). Thus, even a decision that is \"controlled by the . . . principles\" articulated in precedent may announce a new rule, so long as the rule was \"sufficiently debatable\" in advance. Arizona Governing Comm. for Tax Deferred Annuity and Deferred Compensation Plans v. Norris, 463 U. S. 1073, 1109 (1983) (O'Connor, J., concurring). Reading the Davis opinion alone, one might get the impression that it did not announce a new rule even of that variety. The opinion's emphatic language suggests that the outcome was not even debatable. See ante, at 111 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). In my view, however, assertive language is not itself determinative. As The Chief Justice explained for the Court in a different context:\\n\"[T]he fact that a court says that its decision . . . is `controlled' by a prior decision, is not conclusive for purposes of deciding whether the current decision is a `new rule' . . . . Courts frequently view their decisions as being `controlled' or `governed' by prior opinions even *124 when aware of reasonable contrary conclusions reached by other courts.\" Butler v. McKellar, 494 U. S. 407, 415 (1990).\\nIn Butler, we determined that the rule announced in Arizona v. Roberson, 486 U. S. 675 (1988), was \"new\" for purposes of Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989), despite Roberson `s repeated assertions that its rule was \"directly controlled\" by precedent. Indeed, we did not even feel bound by the opinion's statement that it was not announcing a new rule at all but rather declining to create an exception to an existing rule. While Teague and its progeny may not provide the appropriate standard of novelty for Chevron Oil  purposes, their teachingthat whether an opinion is new depends not on its language or tone but on the legal landscape from which it aroseobtains nonetheless.\\nIn any event, Justice Stevens certainly thought that Davis announced a new rule. In fact, he thought that the rule was not only unprecedented, but wrong: \"The Court's holding is not supported by the rationale for the intergovernmental immunity doctrine and is not compelled by our previous decisions. I cannot join the unjustified, court-imposed restriction on a State's power to administer its own affairs.\" 489 U. S., at 818-819 (dissenting opinion). And just last Term two Members of this Court expressed their disagreement with the decision in Davis, labeling its application of the doctrine of intergovernmental immunity \"perverse.\" Barker v. Kansas, 503 U. S. 594, 606 (1992) (Stevens, J., joined by Thomas, J., concurring). Although I would not call our decision in Davis perverse, I agree that its rule was sufficiently debatable in advance as to fall short of being \"clearly foreshadowed.\" The great weight of authority is in accord.[*]\\n*125 In fact, before Davis was announced, conventional wisdom seemed to be directly to the contrary. One would think that, if Davis was \"clearly foreshadowed,\" some taxpayer might have made the intergovernmental immunity argument before. No one had. Twenty-three States had taxation schemes just like the one at issue in Davis; and some of those schemes were established as much as half a century before Davis was decided. See Harper v. Virginia Dept. of Taxation, 241 Va. 232, 237, 401 S. E. 2d 868, 871 (1991). Yet not a single taxpayer ever challenged one of those schemes on intergovernmental immunity grounds until Davis challenged Michigan's in 1984. If Justice Holmes is correct that \"[t]he prophecies of what the courts will do in fact, and nothing more pretentious\" are \"law,\" O. Holmes, The Path of the Law, in Collected Legal Papers 167, 173 (1920), then surely Davis announced new law; the universal \"prophecy\" before Davis seemed to be that such taxation schemes were valid.\\nAn examination of the decision in Davis and its predecessors reveals that Davis was anything but clearly foreshadowed. Of course, it was well established long before Davis  that the nondiscrimination principle of 4 U. S. C. § 111 and the doctrine of intergovernmental immunity prohibit a State from imposing a discriminatory tax on the United States or *126 those who do business with it. The income tax at issue in Davis, however, did not appear discriminatory on its face. Like the Virginia income tax at issue here, it did not single out federal employees or retirees for disfavored treatment. Instead, federal retirees were treated identically to all other retirees, with a single and numerically insignificant exceptionretirees whose retirement benefits were paid by the State. Whether such an exception rendered the tax \"discriminatory\" within the meaning of the intergovernmental immunity doctrine, it seems to me, was an open question. On the one hand, the tax scheme did distinguish between federal retirees and state retirees: The former were required to pay state taxes on their retirement income, while the latter were not. But it was far from clear that such was the proper comparison. In fact, there were strong arguments that it was not.\\nAs Justice Stevens explained more thoroughly in his Davis dissent, 489 U. S., at 819and as we have recognized since McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316 (1819)intergovernmental immunity is necessary to prevent the States from interfering with federal interests through taxation. Because the National Government has no recourse to the state ballot box, it has only a limited ability to protect itself against excessive state taxes. But the risk of excessive taxation of federal interests is eliminated, and \"[a] `political check' is provided, when a state tax falls\" not only on the Federal Government, but also \"on a significant group of state citizens who can be counted upon to use their votes to keep the State from raising the tax excessively, and thus placing an unfair burden on the Federal Government.\"\\nWashington v. United States, 460 U. S. 536, 545 (1983) (emphasis added). Accord, United States v. County of Fresno, 429 U. S. 452, 462-464 (1977); South Carolina v. Baker, 485 U. S. 505, 526, n. 15 (1988).\\nThere can be no doubt that the taxation scheme at issue in Davis and the one employed by the Commonwealth of *127 Virginia provided that necessary \"political check.\" They exempted only a small group of citizens, state retirees, while subjecting the remainder of their citizensfederal retirees, retirees who receive income from private sources, and nonretirees aliketo a uniform income tax. As a result, any attempt to increase income taxes excessively so as to interfere with federal interests would have caused the similarly taxed populace to \"use their votes\" to protect their interests, thereby protecting the interests of the Federal Government as well. There being no risk of abusive taxation of the National Government, there was a good argument that there should have been no intergovernmental immunity problem either. See Davis, 489 U. S., at 821-824 (Stevens, J., dissenting).\\nIn addition, distinguishing between taxation of state retirees and all others, including private and federal retirees, was justifiable from an economic standpoint. The State, after all, does not merely collect taxes from its retirees; it pays their benefits as well. As a result, it makes no difference to the State or the retirees whether the State increases state retirement benefits in an amount sufficient to cover taxes it imposes, or whether the State offers reduced benefits and makes them tax free. The net income level of the retirees and the impact on the state fisc is the same. Thus, the Michigan Department of Taxation had a good argument that its differential treatment of state and federal retirees was \"directly related to, and justified by, [a] significant differenc[e] between the two classes,\" id., at 816 (internal quotation marks omitted): Taxing federal retirees enhances the State's fisc, whereas taxing state retirees does not.\\nI recite these arguments not to show that the decision in Davis was wrongI joined the opinion then and remain of the view that it was correctbut instead to point out that the arguments on the other side were substantial. Of course, the Court was able to \"ancho[r] its decision in precedent,\" ante, at 112 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring *128 in judgment). But surely that cannot be dispositive. Few decisions are so novel that there is no precedent to which they may be moored. What is determinative is that the decision was \"sufficiently debatable\" ex ante that, under Chevron Oil, nonretroactivity cannot be precluded. Arizona Governing Committee v. Norris, 463 U. S., at 1109 (O'Connor, J., concurring). That, it seems to me, is the case here.\\n\\n2\\nThe second Chevron Oil factor is whether denying the rule retroactive application will retard its operation in light of the rule's history, purpose, and effect. 404 U. S., at 107. That factor overwhelmingly favors respondent. The purpose of the intergovernmental immunity doctrine is to protect the rights of the Federal Sovereign against state interference. It does not protect the private rights of individuals:\\n\"[T]he purpose of the immunity was not to confer benefits on the employees by relieving them from contributing their share of the financial support of the other government . . . , but to prevent undue interference with the one government by imposing on it the tax burdens of the other.\" Graves v. New York ex rel. O'Keefe, 306 U. S. 466, 483-484 (1939) (footnote omitted).\\nAccord, Davis, supra, at 814 (\"[I]ntergovernmental tax immunity is based on the need to protect each sovereign's governmental operations from undue interference by the other\"). Affording petitioners retroactive relief in this case would not vindicate the interests of the Federal Government. Instead, it lines the pockets of the Government's former employees. It therefore comes as no surprise that the United States, despite its consistent participation in intergovernmental immunity cases in the past, has taken no position here. Because retroactive application of the rule in Davis  serves petitioners' interests but not the interests intergovernmental *129 immunity was meant to protectthe Federal Government'sdenying Davis retroactive application would not undermine the decision's purpose or effect.\\n\\n3\\nThe final factor under Chevron Oil is whether the decision \"`could produce substantial inequitable results if applied retroactively.' \" Chevron Oil, supra, at 107 (quoting Cipriano  v. City of Houma, 395 U. S., at 706). We repeatedly have declined to give our decisions retroactive effect where doing so would be unjust. In Arizona Governing Committee v. Norris, supra, for example, we declined to apply a Title VII decision retroactively, noting that the resulting \"unanticipated financial burdens would come at a time when many States and local governments are struggling to meet substantial fiscal deficits.\" Id., at 1106-1107 (Powell, J., joined by Burger, C. J., Blackmun, Rehnquist, and O'Connor, JJ.). There was \"no justification\" for \"impos[ing] this magnitude of burden retroactively on the public,\" we concluded. Id., at 1107. Accord, id., at 1107-1111 (O'Connor, J., concurring); see id., at 1075 (per curiam). Similarly, we declined to afford the plaintiff full retroactive relief in Los Angeles Dept. of Water and Power v. Manhart, 435 U. S. 702, 718-723 (1978) (Stevens, J.). There, too, we explained that \"[r]etroactive liability could be devastating\" and that \"[t]he harm would fall in large part on innocent third parties.\" Id. , at 722-723.\\nThose same considerations exist here. Retroactive application of rulings that invalidate state tax laws have the potential for producing \"disruptive consequences for the State[s] and [their] citizens. A refund, if required by state or federal law, could deplete the state treasur[ies], thus threatening the State[s'] current operations and future plans.\" American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith, 496 U. S., at 182 (plurality opinion). Retroactive application of Davis  is no exception. \"The fiscal implications of Davis for the *130 [S]tates,\" one commentator has noted, \"are truly staggering.\" Hellerstein, Preliminary Reflections on McKesson and American Trucking Associations, 48 Tax Notes 325, 336 (1990). The States estimate that their total liability will exceed $1.8 billion. Brief for Respondent SA-1; Brief for State of Utah et al. as Amici Curiae 12-13. Virginia's share alone exceeds $440 million. Brief for Respondent SA-1; Brief for State of Utah et al. as Amici Curiae 12-13. This massive liability could not come at a worse time. See Wall Street Journal, July 27, 1992, p. A2 (\"Most states are in dire fiscal straits, and their deteriorating tax base is making it harder for them to get out, a survey of legislatures indicates\"). Accord, Harper v. Virginia Dept. of Taxation, 241 Va., at 239-240, 401 S. E. 2d, at 873 (such massive liability \"would have a potentially disruptive and destructive impact on the Commonwealth's planning, budgeting, and delivery of essential state services\"); Swanson v. State, 329 N. C. 576, 583, 407 S. E. 2d 791, 794 (1991) (\"this State is in dire financial straits\" and $140 million in refunds would exacerbate it); Bass v. State, 302 S. C. 250, 256, 395 S. E. 2d 171, 174 (1990) ($200 million in refunds \"would impose a severe financial burden on the State and its citizens [and] endanger the financial integrity of the State\"). To impose such liability on Virginia and the other States that relied in good faith on their taxation laws, \"at a time when most States are struggling to fund even the most basic services, is the height of unfairness.\" James B. Beam, 501 U. S., at 558 (O'Connor, J., dissenting).\\nIt cannot be contended that such a burden is justified by the States' conduct, for the liability is entirely disproportionate to the offense. We do not deal with a State that willfully violated the Constitution but rather one that acted entirely in good faith on the basis of an unchallenged statute. Moreover, during the four years in question, the constitutional violation produced a benefit of approximately $8 million to $12 million per year, Tr. of Oral Arg. 33, 36, and that benefit accrued not to the Commonwealth but to individual retirees. *131 Yet, for that $32 million to $48 million error, the Court now allows the imposition of liability well in excess of $400 million dollars. Such liability is more than just disproportionate; it is unconscionable. Finally and perhaps most important, this burden will not fall on some thoughtless government official or even the group of retirees that benefited from the offending exemption. Instead the burden falls squarely on the backs of the blameless and unexpecting taxpayers of the affected States who, although they profited not at all from the exemption, will now be forced to pay higher taxes and be deprived of essential services.\\nPetitioners, in contrast, would suffer no hardship if the Court refused to apply Davis retroactively. For years, 23 States enforced taxation schemes like the Commonwealth's in good faith, and for years not a single taxpayer objected on intergovernmental immunity grounds. No one put the States on notice that their taxing schemes might be constitutionally suspect. Denying Davis retroactive relief thus would not deny petitioners a benefit on which they had relied. It merely would deny them an unanticipated windfall. Because that windfall would come only at the cost of imposing hurtful consequences on innocent taxpayers and the communities in which they live, I believe the substantial inequity of imposing retroactive relief in this case, like the other Chevron factors, weighs in favor of denying Davis retroactive application.\\n\\nIII\\nEven if the Court is correct that Davis must be applied retroactively in this case, there is the separate question of the remedy that must be given. The questions of retroactivity and remedy are analytically distinct. American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith, supra, at 189 (plurality opinion) (\"[T]he Court has never equated its retroactivity principles with remedial principles\"). As Justice Souter explained in James B. Beam, supra, at 534, retroactivity is a matter of choice of law \"[s]ince the question is whether the court *132 should apply the old rule or the new one.\" When the retroactivity of a decision of this Court is in issue, the choice-oflaw issue is a federal question. Ashland Oil, Inc. v. Caryl, 497 U. S. 916, 918 (1990) (per curiam). \\nThe question of remedy, however, is quite different. The issue is not whether to apply new law or old law, but what relief should be afforded once the prevailing party has been determined under applicable law. See James B. Beam, 501 U. S., at 535 (Souter, J.) (\"Once a rule is found to apply `backward,' there may then be a further issue of remedies, i. e., whether the party prevailing under a new rule should obtain the same relief that would have been awarded if the rule had been an old one\"). The question of remedies is in the first instance a question of state law. See ibid. (\"[T]he remedial inquiry is one governed by state law, at least where the case originates in state court\"). In fact, the only federal question regarding remedies is whether the relief afforded is sufficient to comply with the requirements of due process. See McKesson Corp. v. Division of Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco, Fla. Dept. of Business Regulation, 496 U. S. 18, 31-52 (1990).\\nWhile the issue of retroactivity is properly before us, the question of remedies is not. It does not appear to be within the question presented, which asks only if Davis may be applied \"nonretroactively so as to defeat federal retirees' entitlement to refunds.\" Pet. for Cert. i. Moreover, our consideration of the question at this juncture would be inappropriate, as the Supreme Court of Virginia has yet to consider what remedy might be available in light of Davis ` retroactivity and applicable state law. The Court inexplicably discusses the question at length nonetheless, noting that if the Commonwealth of Virginia provides adequate predeprivation remedies, it is under no obligation to provide full retroactive refunds today. Ante, at 100-102.\\nWhen courts take it upon themselves to issue helpful guidance in dictum, they risk creating additional confusion by *133 inadvertently suggesting constitutional absolutes that do not exist. The Court's dictum today follows that course. Amidst its discussion of predeprivation and postdeprivation remedies, the Court asserts that a plaintiff who has been deprived a predeprivation remedy cannot be \"confine[d] . . . to prospective relief.\" Ante, at 101, n. 10. I do not believe the Court's assertion to be correct.\\nOver 20 years ago, Justice Harlan recognized that the equities could be taken into account in determining the appropriate remedy when the Court announces a new rule of constitutional law:\\n\"To the extent that equitable considerations, for example, `reliance,' are relevant, I would take this into account in the determination of what relief is appropriate in any given case. There are, of course, circumstances when a change in the law will jeopardize an edifice which was reasonably constructed on the foundation of prevailing legal doctrine.\" United States v. Estate of Don- nelly, 397 U. S. 286, 296 (1970) (concurring opinion).\\nThe commentators appear to be in accord. See Fallon &amp; Meltzer, New Law, Non-Retroactivity, and Constitutional Remedies, 104 Harv. L. Rev. 1733 (1991) (urging consideration of novelty and hardship as part of the remedial framework rather than as a question of whether to apply old law or new). In my view, and in light of the Court's revisions to the law of retroactivity, it should be constitutionally permissible for the equities to inform the remedial inquiry. In a particularly compelling case, then, the equities might permit a State to deny taxpayers a full refund despite having refused them predeprivation process.\\nIndeed, some Members of this Court have argued that we recognized as much long ago. In American Trucking Assns., 496 U. S., at 219-224 (dissenting opinion), Justice Stevens admitted that this Court repeatedly had applied the Chevron Oil factors to preclude the provision of monetary *134 relief. In Justice Stevens' view, however, Chevron Oil determined the question of remedy rather than which law would apply, new or old. See 496 U. S., at 220 (Chevron Oil and its progeny \"establish a remedial principle for the exercise of equitable discretion by federal courts and not, as the plurality states, a choice-of-law principle applicable to all cases on direct review\"); see also ante, at 95, n. 9 (reserving the possibility that Chevron Oil governs the question of remedies in federal court). If Justice Stevens' view or something like it has prevailed todayand it seems that it hasthen state and federal courts still retain the ability to exercise their \"equitable discretion\" in formulating appropriate relief on a federal claim. After all, it would be wholly anomalous to suggest that federal courts are permitted to determine the scope of the remedy by reference to Chevron Oil, but that state courts are barred from considering the equities altogether. Not only would that unduly restrict state court \"flexibility in the law of remedies,\" Estate of Donnelly, supra, at 297 (Harlan, J., concurring), but it also would turn federalism on its head. I know of no principle of law that permits us to restrict the remedial discretion of state courts without imposing similar restrictions on federal courts. Quite the opposite should be true, as the question of remedies in state court is generally a question of state law in the first instance. James B. Beam, 501 U. S., at 535 (Souter, J.).\\nThe Court cites only a single case that might be read as precluding courts from considering the equities when selecting the remedy for the violation of a novel constitutional rule. That case is McKesson Corp. v. Division of Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco, supra. Ante, at 101-102. But, as the controlling opinion in James B. Beam explains, McKesson cannot be so read. 501 U. S., at 544 (\"Nothing we say here [precludes the right] to raise procedural bars to recovery under state law or demonstrate reliance interests entitled to consideration in determining the nature of the remedy that must be provided, a matter with which McKes- *135 son did not deal \" (emphases added)). Accord, id., at 543 (\"[N]othing we say here precludes consideration of individual equities when deciding remedial issues in particular cases\"). It is true that the Court in McKesson rejected, on due process grounds, the State of Florida's equitable arguments against the requirement of a full refund. But the opinion did not hold that those arguments were irrelevant as a categorical matter. It simply held that the equities in that case were insufficient to support the decision to withhold a remedy. The opinion expressly so states, rejecting the State's equitable arguments as insufficiently \"weighty in these circumstances. \" McKesson, 496 U. S., at 45 (emphasis added).\\nThe circumstances in McKesson were quite different than those here. In McKesson, the tax imposed was patently unconstitutional: The State of Florida collected taxes under its Liquor Tax statute even though this Court already had invalidated a \"virtually identical\" tax. Id., at 46. Given that the State could \"hardly claim surprise\" that its statute was declared invalid, this Court concluded that the State's reliance on the presumptive validity of its statute was insufficient to preclude monetary relief. Ibid. As we explained in American Trucking Assns., the large burden of retroactive relief is \"largely irrelevant when a State violates constitutional norms well established under existing precedent.\" We cited McKesson as an example. 496 U. S., at 183 (plurality opinion).\\nA contrary reading of McKesson would be anomalous in light of this Court's immunity jurisprudence. The Federal Government, for example, is absolutely immune from suit absent an express waiver of immunity; and federal officers enjoy at least qualified immunity when sued in a Bivens action. Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388 (1971). As a result, an individual who suffers a constitutional deprivation at the hands of a federal officer very well may have no access to backwards-looking (monetary) relief. I do not see why the Due Process Clause would *136 require a full, backwards-looking compensatory remedy whenever a governmental official reasonably taxes a citizen under what later turns out to be an unconstitutional statute but not where the officer deprives a citizen of her bodily integrity or her life.\\nIn my view, ifthe Court is going to restrict authority to temper hardship by holding our decisions nonretroactive through the Chevron Oil factors, it must afford courts the ability to avoid injustice by taking equity into account when formulating the remedy for violations of novel constitutional rules. See Fallon &amp; Meltzer, 104 Harv. L. Rev. 1733 (1991). Surely the Constitution permits this Court to refuse plaintiffs full backwards-looking relief under Chevron Oil; we repeatedly have done so in the past. American Trucking Assns., supra, at 188-200 (canvassing the Court's practice); see also supra, at 115-116, 129. I therefore see no reason why it would not similarly permit state courts reasonably to consider the equities in the exercise of their sound remedial discretion.\\n\\nIV\\nIn my view, the correct approach to the retroactivity question before us was articulated in Chevron Oil some 22 years ago. By refusing to apply Chevron Oil today, the Court not only permits the imposition of grave and gratuitous hardship on the States and their citizens, but also disregards settled precedents central to the fairness and accuracy of our decisional processes. Nor does the Court cast any light on the nature of the regime that will govern from here on. To the contrary, the Court's unnecessary innuendo concerning pure prospectivity and ill-advised dictum regarding remedial issues introduce still greater uncertainty and disorder into this already chaotic area. Because I cannot agree with the Court's decision or the manifestly unjust results it appears to portend, I respectfully dissent.\\nNOTES\\n[*]   Briefs of amici curiae urging affirmance were filed for the State of Arkansas by Winston Bryant, Attorney General of Arkansas, and Joyce Kinkead; for the State of Georgia by Michael J.

Smith, 496 U. S. 167, 220 (1990) (Stevens, J., dissenting). Compare id., at 191 197 (plurality opinion) (treating Chevron Oil as a choice-of-law rule), with id., at 218-224 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (treating Chevron Oil as a remedial doctrine). Regardless of how Chevron Oil is characterized, our decision today makes it clear that \"the Chevron Oil test cannot determine the choice of law by relying on the equities of the particular case\" and that the federal law applicable to a particular case does not turn on \"whether [litigants] actually relied on [an] old rule [or] how they would suffer from retroactive application\" of a new one. James B. Beam Distilling Co. v. Georgia, 501 U. S. 529, 543 (1991) (opinion of Souter, J.).\\n[10]  A State incurs this obligation when it \"places a taxpayer under duress promptly to pay a tax when due and relegates him to a postpayment refund action in which he can challenge the tax's legality.\" McKesson, 496 U. S., at 31. A State that \"establish[es] various sanctions and summary remedies designed\" to prompt taxpayers to \"tender . . . payments before  their objections are entertained and resolved\" does not provide taxpayers \"a meaningful opportunity to withhold payment and to obtain a predeprivation determination of the tax assessment's validity.\" Id., at 38 (emphasis in original). Such limitations impose constitutionally significant \"`duress'\" because a tax payment rendered under these circumstances must be treated as an effort \"to avoid financial sanctions or a seizure of real or personal property.\" Id., at 38, n. 21. The State accordingly may not confine a taxpayer under duress to prospective relief.\\n[1]  The dissent attempts to distinguish between retroactivity in civil and criminal settings on three grounds, none of which has ever been adopted by this Court. The dissent's first argument begins with the observation that \"nonretroactivity in criminal cases historically has favored the government's reliance interests over the rights of criminal defendants.\" Post, at 121. But while it is true that prospectivity was usually employed in the past (during the brief period when it was used in criminal cases) to favor the government, there is no basis for the implicit suggestion that it would usually favor the government in the future. That phenomenon was a consequence, not of the nature of the doctrine, cf. James  v. United States, 366 U. S. 213 (1961), but of the historical \"accident\" that during the period prospectivity was in fashion legal rules favoring the government were more frequently overturned. But more fundamentally, to base a rule of full retroactivity in the criminal-law area upon what the dissent calls \"the generalized policy of favoring individual rights over governmental prerogative,\" post, at 121, makes no more sense than to adopt, because of the same \"generalized policy,\" a similarly gross rule that no decision favoring criminal defendants can ever be overruled. The law is more discerning than that. The dissent's next argument is based on the dubious empirical assumption that civil litigants, but not criminal defendants, will often receive some benefit from a prospective decision. That assumption does not hold even in this case: Prospective invalidation of Virginia's taxing scheme would afford petitioners the enormous future \"benefit,\" ibid., of knowing that others in the State are being taxed more. But empirical problems aside, the dissent does not explain why, if a receipt-of-some-benefit principle is important, we should use such an inaccurate proxy as the civil/criminal distinction, or how this newly discovered principle overcomes the \"basic norms of constitutional adjudication\" on which Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U. S. 314, 322 (1987), rested. Finally, the dissent's \"equal treatment\" argument ably distinguishes between cases in which a prospectivity claim is properly raised, and those in which it is not. See post, at 122. But that does nothing to distinguish between civil and criminal cases; obviously, a party may procedurally default on a claim in either context.\\n[2]  Contrary to the suggestion in the dissent, I am not arguing that we should \"cast overboard our entire retroactivity doctrine with . . . [an] unceremonious heave-ho.\" Post, at 116 (emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted). There is no need. We cast over the first half six Terms ago in Griffith, and deep-sixed most of the rest two Terms ago in James B. Beam Distilling Co. v. Georgia, 501 U. S.529 (1991)in neither case unceremoniously (in marked contrast to some of the overrulings cited in text). What little, if any, remains is teetering at the end of the plank and needs no more than a gentle nudge. But if the entire doctrine had been given a quick and unceremonious end, there could be no complaint on the grounds of stare decisis; as it was born, so should it die. I do not know the basis for the dissent's contention that I find the jurisprudence of the era that produced the doctrine of prospectivity \"distasteful.\" Post, at 116. Much of it is quite appetizing. It is only the cavalier treatment of stare decisis and the invention of prospectivity that I have criticized here.\\n[*]   Swanson v.

Gail Starling Marshall argued the cause for respondent. With her on the brief were Mary Sue Terry, Attorney General of Virginia, Stephen D. Rosenthal, Chief Deputy Attorney General, Gregory E. Lucyk and N. Pendleton Rogers, Senior Assistant Attorneys General, Barbara H. Vann, Assistant Attorney General, and Peter W. Low.[*] *89 Justice delivered the opinion of the Court. In Davis v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury, 489 U. S. 803 (1989), we held that a State violates the constitutional doctrine of intergovernmental tax immunity when it taxes retirement benefits paid by the Federal Government but exempts from taxation all retirement benefits paid by the State or its political subdivisions. Relying on the retroactivity analysis of Chevron Oil Co. v. Huson, 404 U. S. 97 (1971), the Supreme Court of Virginia twice refused to apply Davis to *90 taxes imposed before Davis was decided. In accord with Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U. S. 314 (1987), and James B. Beam Distilling Co. v. Georgia, 501 U. S. 529 (1991), we hold that this Court's application of a rule of federal law to the parties before the Court requires every court to give retroactive effect to that decision. We therefore reverse. I The Michigan tax scheme at issue in Davis \"exempt[ed] from taxation all retirement benefits paid by the State or its political subdivisions, but levie[d] an income tax on retirement benefits paid by . . . the Federal Government.\" 489 U. S., at 805. We held that the United States had not consented under 4 U. S. C. § 111[1] to this discriminatory imposition of a heavier tax burden on federal benefits than on state and local benefits. 489 U. S., at 808-817. Because Michigan \"conceded that a refund [was] appropriate,\" we recognized that federal retirees were entitled to a refund of taxes \"paid. . . pursuant to this invalid tax scheme.\" Id., at 817.[2] Like Michigan, Virginia exempted state and local employees' retirement benefits from state income taxation while taxing federal retirement benefits. Va. Code Ann. § 58.1 322(c)(3) (Supp. 1988). In response to Davis, Virginia repealed its exemption for state and local government employees. 1989 Va. Acts, Special Sess. II, ch. 3. It also enacted a special statute of limitations for refund claims made in light of Davis. Under this statute, taxpayers may seek a refund *91 of state taxes imposed on federal retirement benefits in 1985, 1986, 1987, and 1988 for up to one year from the date of the final judicial resolution of whether Virginia must refund these taxes. Va. Code Ann. § 58.1-1823(b) (Supp. 1992).[3] Petitioners, 421 federal civil service and military retirees, sought a refund of taxes \"erroneously or improperly assessed\" in violation of Davis ` nondiscrimination principle. Va. Code Ann. § 58.1-1826 (1991). The trial court denied relief. Law No. CL891080 (Va. Cir. Ct., Mar. 12, 1990). Applying the factors set forth in Chevron Oil Co. v. Huson, supra, at 106-107,[4] the court reasoned that \"Davis decided an issue of first impression whose resolution was not clearly foreshadowed,\" that \"prospective application of Davis will not retard its operation,\" and that \"retroactive application would result in inequity, injustice and hardship.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 20a. The Supreme Court of Virginia affirmed. Harper v. Virginia Dept. of Taxation, 241 Va. 232, 401 S. E. 2d 868 (1991). It too concluded, after consulting Chevron and the plurality opinion in American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith, 496 U. S. 167 (1990), that \"the Davis decision is not to be applied retroactively.\" 241 Va., at 240, 401 S. E. 2d, at 873. The court also rejected petitioners' contention that \"refunds *92 [were] due as a matter of state law.\" Ibid. It concluded that \"because the Davis decision is not to be applied retroactively, the pre-Davis assessments were neither erroneous nor improper\" under Virginia's tax refund statute. Id., at 241, 401 S. E. 2d, at 873. As a matter of Virginia law, the court held, a \"ruling declaring a taxing scheme unconstitutional is to be applied prospectively only.\" Ibid. This rationale supplied \"another reason\" for refusing relief. Ibid. Even as the Virginia courts were denying relief to petitioners, we were confronting a similar retroactivity problem in James B. Beam Distilling Co. v. Georgia, 501 U. S. 529 (1991). At issue was Bacchus Imports, Ltd. v. Dias, 468 U. S. 263 (1984), which prohibited States from imposing higher excise taxes on imported alcoholic beverages than on local products. The Supreme Court of Georgia had used the analysis described in Chevron Oil Co. v. Huson to deny retroactive effect to a decision of this Court. Six Members of this Court disagreed, concluding instead that Bacchus must be applied retroactively to claims arising from facts predating that decision. Beam, 501 U. S., at 532 (opinion of Souter, J.); id., at 544-545 (White, J., concurring in judgment); id., at 547-548 (Blackmun, J., concurring in judgment); id., at 548-549 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment). After deciding Beam, we vacated the judgment in Harper and remanded for further consideration. 501 U. S. 1247 (1991). On remand, the Supreme Court of Virginia again denied tax relief. 242 Va. 322, 410 S. E. 2d 629 (1991). It reasoned that because Michigan did not contest the Davis plaintiffs' entitlement to a refund, this Court \"made no . . . ruling\" regarding the retroactive application of its rule \"to the litigants in that case.\" 242 Va., at 326, 410 S. E. 2d, at 631. Concluding that Beam did not foreclose application of Chevron `s retroactivity analysis because \"the retroactivity issue was not decided in Davis, \" 242 Va., at 326, 410 S. E. 2d, at *93 631, the court \"reaffirm[ed] [its] prior decision in all respects,\" id., at 327, 410 S. E. 2d, at 632. When we decided Davis, 23 States gave preferential tax treatment to benefits received by employees of state and local governments relative to the tax treatment of benefits received by federal employees.[5] Like the Supreme Court of Virginia, several other state courts have refused to accord full retroactive effect to Davis as a controlling statement of federal law.[6] Two of the courts refusing to apply Davis retroactively have done so after this Court remanded for reconsideration in light of Beam. See Bass v. South Carolina, 501 U. S. 1246 (1991); Harper v. Virginia Dept. of Taxation, 501 U. S. 1247 (1991); Lewy v. Virginia Dept. of Taxation, decided with Harper v. Virginia Dept. of Taxation, 501 U. S. 1247 (1991). By contrast, the Supreme Court of Arkansas has concluded as a matter of federal law that Davis applies retroactively. Pledger v. Bosnick, 306 Ark. 45, 54-56, 811 S. W. 2d 286, 292-293 (1991), cert. pending, No. 91-375. Cf. Reich v. Collins, 262 Ga. 625, 422 S. E. 2d 846 (1992) *94 (holding that Davis applies retroactively but reasoning that state law precluded a refund), cert. pending, Nos. 92-1276 and 92-1453.[7] After the Supreme Court of Virginia reaffirmed its original decision, we granted certiorari a second time. 504 U. S. 907 (1992). We now reverse. II \"[B]oth the common law and our own decisions\" have \"recognized a general rule of retrospective effect for the constitutional decisions of this Court.\" Robinson v. Neil, 409 U. S. 505, 507 (1973). Nothing in the Constitution alters the fundamental rule of \"retrospective operation\" that has governed \"[j]udicial decisions . . . for near a thousand years.\" Kuhn v. Fairmont Coal Co., 215 U. S. 349, 372 (1910) (Holmes, J., dissenting). In Linkletter v. Walker, 381 U. S. 618 (1965), however, we developed a doctrine under which we could deny retroactive effect to a newly announced rule of criminal law. Under Linkletter, a decision to confine a new rule to prospective application rested on the purpose of the new rule, the reliance placed upon the previous view of the law, and \"the effect on the administration of justice of a retrospective application\" of the new rule. Id., at 636 (limiting Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S. 643 (1961)).[8] In the civil context, we similarly permitted the denial of retroactive effect to \"a new principle of law\" if such a limitation would avoid \"`injustice or hardship'\" without unduly undermining the \"purpose *95 and effect\" of the new rule. Chevron Oil Co. v. Huson, 404 U. S., at 106-107 (quoting Cipriano v. City of Houma, 395 U. S. 701, 706 (1969)).[9] We subsequently overruled Linkletter in Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U. S. 314 (1987), and eliminated limits on retroactivity in the criminal context by holding that all \"newly declared . . . rule[s]\" must be applied retroactively to all \"criminal cases pending on direct review.\" Id., at 322. This holding rested on two \"basic norms of constitutional adjudication.\" Ibid. First, we reasoned that \"the nature of judicial review\" strips us of the quintessentially \"legislat[ive]\" prerogative to make rules of law retroactive or prospective as we see fit. Ibid. Second, we concluded that \"selective application of new rules violates the principle of treating similarly situated [parties] the same.\" Id., at 323. Dicta in Griffith, however, stated that \"civil retroactivity. . . . continue[d] to be governed by the standard announced in Chevron Oil. \" Id., at 322, n. 8. We divided over the meaning of this dicta in American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith, 496 U. S. 167 (1990). The four Justices in the plurality used \"the Chevron Oil test\" to consider whether to confine \"the application of [American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Scheiner, 483 U. S. 266 (1987),] to taxation of highway use prior to June 23, 1987, the date we decided Scheiner. \" Id., *96 at 179 (opinion of O'Connor, J., joined by Rehnquist, C. J., and White and Kennedy, JJ.). Four other Justices rejected the plurality's \"anomalous approach\" to retroactivity and declined to hold that \"the law applicable to a particular case is that law which the parties believe in good faith to be applicable to the case.\" Id., at 219 (Stevens, J., dissenting, joined by Brennan, Marshall, and Blackmun, JJ.). Finally, despite concurring in the judgment, Justice Scalia \"share[d]\" the dissent's \"perception that prospective decisionmaking is incompatible with the judicial role.\" Id., at 201. Griffith and American Trucking thus left unresolved the precise extent to which the presumptively retroactive effect of this Court's decisions may be altered in civil cases. But we have since adopted a rule requiring the retroactive application of a civil decision such as Davis. Although James B. Beam Distilling Co. v. Georgia, 501 U. S. 529 (1991), did not produce a unified opinion for the Court, a majority of Justices agreed that a rule of federal law, once announced and applied to the parties to the controversy, must be given full retroactive effect by all courts adjudicating federal law. In announcing the judgment of the Court, Justice Souter laid down a rule for determining the retroactive effect of a civil decision: After the case announcing any rule of federal law has \"appl[ied] that rule with respect to the litigants\" before the court, no court may \"refuse to apply [that] rule . . . retroactively.\" Id., at 540 (opinion of Souter, J., joined by Stevens, J.). Justice Souter's view of retroactivity superseded \"any claim based on a Chevron Oil analysis.\" Ibid. Justice White likewise concluded that a decision \"extending the benefit of the judgment\" to the winning party \"is to be applied to other litigants whose cases were not final at the time of the [first] decision.\" Id., at 544 (opinion concurring in judgment). Three other Justices agreed that \"our judicial responsibility . . . requir[es] retroactive application of each . . . rule we announce.\" Id., at 548 (Blackmun, J., *97 joined by Marshall and Scalia, JJ., concurring in judgment). See also id., at 548-549 (Scalia, J., joined by Marshall and Blackmun, JJ., concurring in judgment). Beam controls this case, and we accordingly adopt a rule that fairly reflects the position of a majority of Justices in Beam: When this Court applies a rule of federal law to the parties before it, that rule is the controlling interpretation of federal law and must be given full retroactive effect in all cases still open on direct review and as to all events, regardless of whether such events predate or postdate our announcement of the rule. This rule extends Griffith `s ban against \"selective application of new rules.\" 479 U. S., at 323. Mindful of the \"basic norms of constitutional adjudication\" that animated our view of retroactivity in the criminal context, id., at 322, we now prohibit the erection of selective temporal barriers to the application of federal law in noncriminal cases. In both civil and criminal cases, we can scarcely permit \"the substantive law [to] shift and spring\" according to \"the particular equities of [individual parties'] claims\" of actual reliance on an old rule and of harm from a retroactive application of the new rule. Beam, supra, at 543 (opinion of Souter, J.). Our approach to retroactivity heeds the admonition that \"[t]he Court has no more constitutional authority in civil cases than in criminal cases to disregard current law or to treat similarly situated litigants differently.\" American Trucking, supra, at 214 (Stevens, J., dissenting). The Supreme Court of Virginia \"appl[ied] the threepronged Chevron Oil test in deciding the retroactivity issue\" presented by this litigation. 242 Va., at 326, 410 S. E. 2d, at 631. When this Court does not \"reserve the question whether its holding should be applied to the parties before it,\" however, an opinion announcing a rule of federal law \"is properly understood to have followed the normal rule of retroactive application\" and must be \"read to hold . . . that its rule should apply retroactively to the litigants then before *98 the Court.\" Beam, 501 U. S., at 539 (opinion of Souter, J.). Accord, id., at 544-545 (White, J., concurring in judgment); id., at 550 (O'Connor, J., dissenting). Furthermore, the legal imperative \"to apply a rule of federal law retroactively after the case announcing the rule has already done so\" must \"prevai[l] over any claim based on a Chevron Oil analysis.\" Id., at 540 (opinion of Souter, J.). In an effort to distinguish Davis, the Supreme Court of Virginia surmised that this Court had \"made no . . . ruling\" about the application of the rule announced in Davis \"retroactively to the litigants in that case.\" 242 Va., at 326, 410 S. E. 2d, at 631. \"[B]ecause the retroactivity issue was not decided in Davis, \" the court believed that it was \"not foreclosed by precedent from applying the three-pronged Chevron Oil test in deciding the retroactivity issue in the present case.\" Ibid. We disagree. Davis did not hold that preferential state tax treatment of state and local employee pensions, though constitutionally invalid in the future, should be upheld as to all events predating the announcement of Davis. The governmental appellee in Davis \"conceded that a refund [would have been] appropriate\" if we were to conclude that \"the Michigan Income Tax Act violate[d] principles of intergovernmental tax immunity by favoring retired state and local governmental employees over retired federal employees.\" 489 U. S., at 817. We stated that \"to the extent appellant has paid taxes pursuant to this invalid tax scheme, he is entitled to a refund.\" Ibid. Far from reserving the retroactivity question, our response to the appellee's concession constituted a retroactive application of the rule announced in Davis to the parties before the Court. Because a decision to accord solely prospective effect to Davis would have foreclosed any discussion of remedial issues, our \"consideration of remedial issues\" meant \"necessarily\" that we retroactively applied the rule we announced in Davis to the litigants before us. Beam, supra, at 539 (opinion of Souter, J.). *99 Therefore, under Griffith, Beam, and the retroactivity approach we adopt today, the Supreme Court of Virginia must apply Davis in petitioners' refund action. III Respondent Virginia Department of Taxation defends the judgment below as resting on an independent and adequate state ground that relieved the Supreme Court of Virginia of any obligation to apply Davis to events occurring before our announcement of that decision. Petitioners had contended that \"even if the Davis decision applie[d] prospectively only,\" they were entitled to relief under Virginia's tax refund statute, Va. Code Ann. § 58.1-1826 (1991). Harper v. Virginia Dept. of Taxation, 241 Va., at 241, 401 S. E. 2d, at 873. The Virginia court rejected their argument. It first reasoned that because Davis did not apply retroactively, tax assessments predating Davis were \"neither erroneous nor improper within the meaning\" of Virginia's tax statute. Ibid. The court then offered \"another reason\" for rejecting petitioners' \"state-law contention\": \"We previously have held that this Court's ruling declaring a taxing scheme unconstitutional is to be applied prospectively only.\" Ibid. (citing Perkins v. Albemarle County, 214 Va. 240, 198 S. E. 2d 626, aff'd and modified on rehearing, 214 Va. 416, 200 S. E. 2d 566 (1973); Capehart v. City of Chesapeake, No. 5459 (Va. Cir. Ct., Oct. 16, 1974), appeal denied, 215 Va. xlvii, cert. denied, 423 U. S. 875 (1975)). The formulation of this state-law retroactivity doctrinethat \"consideration should be given to the purpose of the new rule, the extent of the reliance on the old rule, and the effect on the administration of justice of a retroactive application of the new rule,\" Fountain v. Fountain, 214 Va. 347, 348, 200 S. E. 2d 513, 514 (1973), cert. denied, 416 U. S. 939 (1974), quoted in 241 Va., at 241, 401 S. E. 2d, at 874suggests that the Supreme Court of Virginia has simply incorporated into state law the threepronged analysis of Chevron Oil, 404 U. S., at 106-107, and *100 the criminal retroactivity cases overruled by Griffith, see, e. g., Stovall v. Denno, 388 U. S. 293, 297 (1967). We reject the department's defense of the decision below. The Supremacy Clause, U. S. Const., Art. VI, cl. 2, does not allow federal retroactivity doctrine to be supplanted by the invocation of a contrary approach to retroactivity under state law. Whatever freedom state courts may enjoy to limit the retroactive operation of their own interpretations of state law, see Great Northern R. Co. v. Sunburst Oil &amp; Refining Co., 287 U. S. 358, 364-366 (1932), cannot extend to their interpretations of federal law. See National Mines Corp. v. Caryl, 497 U. S. 922, 923 (1990) (per curiam); Ashland Oil, Inc. v. Caryl, 497 U. S. 916, 917 (1990) (per curiam). We also decline the Department of Taxation's invitation to affirm the judgment as resting on the independent and adequate ground that Virginia's law of remedies offered no \"retrospective refund remedy for taxable years concluded before Davis \" was announced. Brief for Respondent 33. The Virginia Supreme Court's conclusion that the challenged tax assessments were \"neither erroneous nor improper within the meaning\" of the refund statute rested solely on the court's determination that Davis did not apply retroactively. Harper v. Virginia Dept. of Taxation, supra, at 241, 401 S. E. 2d, at 873. Because we have decided that Davis applies retroactively to the tax years at issue in petitioners' refund action, we reverse the judgment below. We do not enter judgment for petitioners, however, because federal law does not necessarily entitle them to a refund. Rather, the Constitution requires Virginia \"to provide relief consistent with federal due process principles.\" American Trucking, 496 U. S., at 181 (plurality opinion). Under the Due Process Clause, U. S. Const., Amdt. 14, § 1, \"a State found to have imposed an impermissibly discriminatory tax retains flexibility in responding to this determination.\" McKesson Corp. v. Division of *101 Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco, Fla. Dept. of Business Regulation, 496 U. S. 18, 39-40 (1990). If Virginia \"offers a meaningful opportunity for taxpayers to withhold contested tax assessments and to challenge their validity in a predeprivation hearing,\" the \"availability of a predeprivation hearing constitutes a procedural safeguard . . . sufficient by itself to satisfy the Due Process Clause.\" Id., at 38, n. 21. On the other hand, if no such predeprivation remedy exists, \"the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment obligates the State to provide meaningful backward-looking relief to rectify any unconstitutional deprivation.\" Id. , at 31 (footnotes omitted).[10] In providing such relief, a State may either award full refunds to those burdened by an unlawful tax or issue some other order that \"create[s] in hindsight a nondiscriminatory scheme.\" Id., at 40. Cf. Davis, 489 U. S., at 818 (suggesting that a State's failure to respect intergovernmental tax immunity could be cured \"either by extending [a discriminatory] tax exemption to retired federal employees . . . or by eliminating the exemption for retired state and local government employees\"). The constitutional sufficiency of any remedy thus turns (at least initially) on whether Virginia law \"provide[s] a[n] [adequate] form of `predeprivation process,' for example, by authorizing taxpayers to bring suit to enjoin imposition of a tax *102 prior to its payment, or by allowing taxpayers to withhold payment and then interpose their objections as defenses in a tax enforcement proceeding.\" McKesson, 496 U. S., at 3637. Because this issue has not been properly presented, we leave to Virginia courts this question of state law and the performance of other tasks pertaining to the crafting of any appropriate remedy. Virginia \"is free to choose which form of relief it will provide, so long as that relief satisfies the minimum federal requirements we have outlined.\" Id., at 51-52. State law may provide relief beyond the demands of federal due process, id., at 52, n. 36, but under no circumstances may it confine petitioners to a lesser remedy, see id., at 44-51. IV We reverse the judgment of the Supreme Court of Virginia, and we remand the case for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. So ordered. Justice Scalia, concurring. I am surprised to see an appeal to stare decisis in today's dissent. In Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989), Justice O'Connor wrote for a plurality that openly rejected settled precedent controlling the scope of retroactivity on collateral review. \"This retroactivity determination,\" the opinion said, \"would normally entail application of the Linkletter [v. Walker, 381 U. S. 618 (1965),] standard, but we believe that our approach to retroactivity for cases on collateral review requires modification.\" Id., at 301. The dissent in Teague was a sort of anticipatory echo of today's dissent, criticizing the plurality for displaying \"infidelity to the doctrine of stare decisis,\" id., at 331 (Brennan, J., dissenting), for \"upset[ting]. . . our time-honored precedents,\" id., at 333, for \"repudiating our familiar approach without regard for the doctrine of stare decisis,\" id., at 345, and for failing \"so much as [to] mention stare decisis,\" id., at 333. *103 I joined the plurality opinion in Teague. Not only did I believe the rule it announced was correct, see Withrow v. Williams, 507 U. S. 680, 717 (1993) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part), but I also believed that abandonment of our prior collateral-review retroactivity rule was fully in accord with the doctrine of stare decisis, which as applied by our Court has never been inflexible. The Teague plurality opinion set forth good reasons for abandoning Linkletter reasons justifying a similar abandonment of Chevron Oil Co. v. Huson, 404 U. S. 97 (1971). It noted, for example, that Linkletter \"ha[d] not led to consistent results,\" Teague, supra, at 302; but neither has Chevron Oil. Proof that what it means is in the eye of the beholder is provided quite nicely by the separate opinions filed today: Of the four Justices who would still apply Chevron Oil, two find Davis v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury, 489 U. S. 803 (1989), retroactive, see post, at 111 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment), two find it not retroactive, see post, at 122 (O'Connor, J., dissenting). Second, the Teague plurality opinion noted that Linkletter had been criticized by commentators, Teague, supra, at 303; but the commentary cited in the opinion criticized not just Linkletter, but the Court's retroactivity jurisprudence in general, of which it considered Chevron Oil an integral part, see Beytagh, Ten Years of Non-Retroactivity: A Critique and a Proposal, 61 Va. L. Rev. 1557, 1558, 1581-1582, 1606 (1975). Other commentary, of course, has also regarded the issue of retroactivity as a general problem of jurisprudence. See, e. g., Fallon &amp; Meltzer, New Law, Non-Retroactivity, and Constitutional Remedies, 104 Harv. L. Rev. 1731 (1991); Schaefer, Prospective Rulings: Two Perspectives, 1982 S. Ct. Rev. 1; Schaefer, The Control of \"Sunbursts\": Techniques of Prospective Overruling, 42 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 631 (1967); Mishkin, Forward: The High Court, The Great Writ, and the Due Process of Time and Law, 79 Harv. L. Rev. 56, 58-72 (1965). *104 Finally, the plurality opinion in Teague justified the departure from Linkletter by implicitly relying on the well-settled proposition that stare decisis has less force where intervening decisions \"have removed or weakened the conceptual underpinnings from the prior decision.\" Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U. S. 164, 173 (1989). Justice O'Connor endorsed the reasoning expressed by Justice Harlan in his separate opinions in Mackey v. United States, 401 U. S. 667 (1971), and Desist v. United States, 394 U. S. 244 (1969), and noted that the Court had already adopted the first part of Justice Harlan's retroactivity views in Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U. S. 314 (1987). See Teague, supra, at 303-305. Again, this argument equallyindeed, even more forcefullysupports reconsideration of Chevron Oil. Griffith returned this Court, in criminal cases, to the traditional view (which I shall discuss at greater length below) that prospective decisionmaking \"violates basic norms of constitutional adjudication.\" Griffith, supra, at 322. One of the conceptual underpinnings of Chevron Oil was that retroactivity presents a similar problem in both civil and criminal contexts. See Chevron Oil, supra, at 106; see also Beytagh, supra, at 1606. Thus, after Griffith, Chevron Oil can be adhered to only by rejecting the reasoning of Chevron Oil  that is, only by asserting that the issue of retroactivity is different in the civil and criminal settings. That is a particularly difficult proof to make, inasmuch as Griffith rested on \"basic norms of constitutional adjudication\" and \"the nature of judicial review.\" 479 U. S., at 322; see also Teague, supra, at 317 (White, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (Griffith \"appear[s] to have constitutional underpinnings\").[1] *105 What most provokes comment in the dissent, however, is not its insistence that today a rigid doctrine of stare decisis forbids tinkering with retroactivity, which four Terms ago did not; but rather the irony of its invoking stare decisis in defense of prospective decisionmaking at all. Prospective decisionmaking is the handmaid of judicial activism, and the born enemy of stare decisis. It was formulated in the heyday of legal realism and promoted as a \"techniqu[e] of judicial lawmaking\" in general, and more specifically as a means of making it easier to overrule prior precedent. B. Levy, Realist Jurisprudence and Prospective Overruling, *106 109 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1 (1960). Thus, the dissent is saying, in effect, that stare decisis demands the preservation of methods of destroying stare decisis recently invented in violation of stare decisis. Contrary to the dissent's assertion that Chevron Oil articulated \"our traditional retroactivity analysis,\" post, at 113, the jurisprudence it reflects \"came into being,\" as Justice Harlan observed, less than 30 years ago with Linkletter v. Walker, 381 U. S. 618 (1965). Mackey, supra, at 676. It is so unancient that one of the current Members of this Court was sitting when it was invented. The true traditional view is that prospective decisionmaking is quite incompatible with the judicial power, and that courts have no authority to engage in the practice. See ante, at 94; James B. Beam Distilling Co. v. Georgia, 501 U. S. 529, 534 (1991) (opinion of Souter, J.); American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith, 496 U. S. 167, 201 (1990) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment); Desist, supra, at 258-259 (Harlan, J., dissenting); Great Northern R. Co. v. Sunburst Oil &amp; Refining Co., 287 U. S. 358, 365 (1932). Linkletter itself recognized that \"[a]t common law there was no authority for the proposition that judicial decisions made law only for the future.\" 381 U. S., at 622-623. And before Linkletter, the academic proponents of prospective judicial decisionmaking acknowledged that their proposal contradicted traditional practice. See, e. g., Levy, supra, at 2, and n. 2; Carpenter, Court Decisions and the Common Law, 17 Colum. L. Rev. 593, 594 (1917). Indeed, the roots of the contrary tradition are so deep that Justice Holmes was prepared to hazard the guess that \"[j]udicial decisions have had retrospective operation for near a thousand years.\" Kuhn v. Fairmont Coal Co., 215 U. S. 349, 372 (1910) (dissenting opinion). Justice O'Connor asserts that \"`[w]hen the Court changes its mind, the law changes with it.' \" Post, at 115 (quoting Beam, supra, at 550 (O'Connor, J., dissenting)). That concept is quite foreign to the American legal and constitutional *107 tradition. It would have struck John Marshall as an extraordinary assertion of raw power. The conception of the judicial role that he possessed, and that was shared by succeeding generations of American judges until very recent times, took it to be \"the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is, \" Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 177 (1803) (emphasis added)not what the law shall be. That original and enduring American perception of the judicial role sprang not from the philosophy of Nietzsche but from the jurisprudence of Blackstone, which viewed retroactivity as an inherent characteristic of the judicial power, a power \"not delegated to pronounce a new law, but to maintain and expound the old one.\" 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries 69 (1765). Even when a \"former determination is most evidently contrary to reason . . . [or] contrary to the divine law,\" a judge overruling that decision would \"not pretend to make a new law, but to vindicate the old one from misrepresentation.\" Id., at 69-70. \"For if it be found that the former decision is manifestly absurd or unjust, it is declared, not that such a sentence was bad law, but that it was not law. \" Id., at 70 (emphases in original). Fully retroactive decisionmaking was considered a principal distinction between the judicial and the legislative power: \"[I]t is said that that which distinguishes a judicial from a legislative act is, that the one is a determination of what the existing law is in relation to some existing thing already done or happened, while the other is a predetermination of what the law shall be for the regulation of all future cases.\" T. Cooley, Constitutional Limitations *91. The critics of the traditional rule of full retroactivity were well aware that it was grounded in what one of them contemptuously called \"another fiction known as the Separation of powers.\" Kocourek, Retrospective Decisions and Stare Decisis and a Proposal, 17 A. B. A. J. 180, 181 (1931). Prospective decisionmaking was known to foe and friend alike as a practical tool of judicial activism, born out of disregard *108 for stare decisis. In the eyes of its enemies, the doctrine \"smack[ed] of the legislative process,\" Mishkin, 79 Harv. L. Rev., at 65, \"encroach[ed] on the prerogatives of the legislative department of government,\" Von Moschzisker, Stare Decisis in Courts of Last Resort, 37 Harv. L. Rev. 409, 428 (1924), removed \"one of the great inherent restraints upon this Court's depart[ing] from the field of interpretation to enter that of lawmaking,\" James v. United States, 366 U. S. 213, 225 (1961) (Black, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part), caused the Court's behavior to become \"assimilated to that of a legislature,\" Kurland, Toward a Political Supreme Court, 37 U. Chi. L. Rev. 19, 34 (1969), and tended \"to cut [the courts] loose from the force of precedent, allowing [them] to restructure artificially those expectations legitimately created by extant law and thereby mitigate the practical force of stare decisis, \" Mackey, 401 U. S., at 680 (Harlan, J., concurring in judgment). All this was not denied by the doctrine's friends, who also viewed it as a device to \"augmen[t] the power of the courts to contribute to the growth of the law in keeping with the demands of society,\" Mallamud, Prospective Limitation and the Rights of the Accused, 56 Iowa L. Rev. 321, 359 (1970), as \"a deliberate and conscious technique of judicial lawmaking,\" Levy, 109 U. Pa. L. Rev., at 6, as a means of \"facilitating more effective and defensible judicial lawmaking,\" id., at 28. Justice Harlan described this Court's embrace of the prospectivity principle as \"the product of the Court's disquietude with the impacts of its fast-moving pace of constitutional innovation,\" Mackey, supra, at 676. The Court itself, however, glowingly described the doctrine as the cause rather than the effect of innovation, extolling it as a \"technique\" providing the \"impetus . . . for the implementation of long overdue reforms.\" Jenkins v. Delaware, 395 U. S. 213, 218 (1969). Whether cause or effect, there is no doubt that the era which gave birth to the prospectivity principle was marked by a newfound disregard for stare decisis. As one *109 commentator calculated, \"[b]y 1959, the number of instances in which the Court had reversals involving constitutional issues had grown to sixty; in the two decades which followed, the Court overruled constitutional cases on no less than forty-seven occasions.\" Maltz, Some Thoughts on the Death of Stare Decisis in Constitutional Law, 1980 Wis. L. Rev. 467. It was an era when this Court cast overboard numerous settled decisions, and indeed even whole areas of law, with an unceremonious \"heave-ho.\" See, e. g., Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S. 643 (1961) (overruling Wolf v. Colorado, 338 U. S. 25 (1949)); Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335 (1963) (overruling Betts v. Brady, 316 U. S. 455 (1942)); Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, 479, n. 48 (1966) (overruling Crooker v. California, 357 U. S. 433 (1958), and Cicenia v. Lagay, 357 U. S. 504 (1958)); Katz v. United States, 389 U. S. 347 (1967) (overruling Olmstead v. United States, 277 U. S. 438 (1928), and Goldman v. United States, 316 U. S. 129 (1942)). To argue now that one of the jurisprudential tools of judicial activism from that period should be extended on grounds of stare decisis can only be described as paradoxical.[2] In sum, I join the opinion of the Court because the doctrine of prospective decisionmaking is not in fact protected *110 by our flexible rule of stare decisis; and because no friend of stare decisis would want it to be. Justice Kennedy, with whom Justice White joins, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment. I remain of the view that it is sometimes appropriate in the civil context to give only prospective application to a judicial decision. \"[P]rospective overruling allows courts to respect the principle of stare decisis even when they are impelled to change the law in light of new understanding.\" American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith, 496 U. S. 167, 197 (1990) (plurality opinion). When a court promulgates a new rule of law, prospective application functions \"to avoid injustice or hardship to civil litigants who have justifiably relied on prior law.\" Id., at 199 (internal quotation marks omitted). See Phoenix v. Kolodziejski, 399 U. S. 204, 213-215 (1970); Cipriano v. City of Houma, 395 U. S. 701, 706 (1969) (per curiam); England v. Louisiana Bd. of Medical Examiners, 375 U. S. 411, 422 (1964). And in my view retroactivity in civil cases continues to be governed by the standard announced in Chevron Oil Co. v. Huson, 404 U. S. 97, 106-107 (1971). Thus, for the reasons explained by Justice O'Connor, post, at 113-117, I cannot agree with the Court's broad dicta, ante, at 95-97, that appears to embrace in the civil context the retroactivity principles adopted for criminal cases in Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U. S. 314 (1987). As Justice O'Connor has demonstrated elsewhere, the differences between the civil and criminal contexts counsel strongly against adoption of Griffith for civil cases. See American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith, supra, at 197-199. I also cannot accept the Court's conclusion, ante, at 96-99, which is based on Justice Souter's opinion in James B. Beam Distilling Co. v. Georgia, 501 U. S. 529, 540-543 (1991), that a decision of this Court must be applied in a retroactive manner simply because the rule of law there announced happened to be applied to the parties then before the Court. *111 See post, at 117-122 (O'Connor, J.,dissenting); James B. Beam Distilling Co. v. Georgia, supra, at 550-552 (O'Connor, J., dissenting). For these reasons, I do not join Part II of the Court's opinion. I nonetheless agree with the Court that Davis v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury, 489 U. S. 803 (1989), must be given retroactive effect. The first condition for prospective application of any decision is that itmust announce a new rule of law. Ashland Oil, Inc. v. Caryl, 497 U. S. 916, 918 (1990) (per curiam); American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith, supra, at 179; United States v. Johnson, 457 U. S. 537, 550, n. 12 (1982); Chevron Oil Co. v. Huson, 404 U. S., at 106-107. The decision must \"overrul[e] clear past precedent on which litigants may have relied\" or \"decid[e] an issue of first impression whose resolution was not clearly foreshadowed.\" Id. , at 106. Because Davis did neither, it did not announce new law and therefore must be applied in a retroactive manner. Respondent argues that two new principles of law were established in Davis. First, it points to the holding that 4 U. S. C. § 111, in which the United States consents to state taxation of the compensation of \"an officer or employee of the United States,\" applies to federal retirees as well as current federal employees. Brief for Respondent 16-18. See Davis, 489 U. S., at 808-810. In Davis, however, we indicated that this holding was \"dictate[d]\" by \"the plain language of the statute,\" id., at 808, and we added for good measure our view that the language of the statute was \"unambiguous,\" \"unmistakable,\" and \"leaves no room for doubt,\" id., at 809, n. 3, 810. Given these characterizations, it is quite implausible to contend that in this regard Davis decided \"an issue of first impression whose resolution was not clearly foreshadowed.\" Chevron Oil, supra, at 106. The second new rule respondent contends the Court announced in Davis was that the state statute at issue discriminated against federal retirees even though the statute treated them like all other state taxpayers except state employees. *112 Brief for Respondent 18-26. See Davis, supra, at 814, 815, n. 4. The Davis Court, however, anchored its decision in precedent. We observed that in Phillips Chemical Co. v. Dumas Independent School Dist., 361 U. S. 376 (1960), \"we faced th[e] precise situation\" confronting us in Davis, and so Phillips Chemical controlled our holding. 489 U. S., at 815, n. 4. To be sure, Justice Stevens in dissent disagreed with these contentions and attempted to distinguish Phillips Chemical. 489 U. S., at 824-826. The Court, however, was not persuaded at the time, and I remain convinced that the Court had the better reading of Phillips Chemical. A contrary holding in Davis, in my view, would have created a clear inconsistency in our jurisprudence. Under Chevron Oil, application of precedent which directly controls is not the stuff of which new law is made. Far from being \"revolutionary,\" Ashland Oil Co. v. Caryl, supra, at 920, or \"an avulsive change which caused the current of the law thereafter to flow between new banks,\" Hanover Shoe, Inc. v. United Shoe Machinery Co., 392 U. S. 481, 499 (1968), Davis was a mere application of plain statutory language and existing precedent. In these circumstances, this Court is not free to mitigate any financial hardship that might befall Virginia's taxpayers as a result of their state government's failure to reach a correct understanding of the unambiguous dictates of federal law. Because I do not believe that Davis v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury, supra, announced a new principle of law, I have no occasion to consider Justice O'Connor's argument, post, at 131-136, that equitable considerations may inform the formulation of remedies when a new rule is announced. In any event, I do not read Part III of the Court's opinion as saying anything inconsistent with what Justice O'Connor proposes. On this understanding, I join Parts I and III of the Court's opinion and concur in its judgment. *113 Justice O'Connor, with whom The Chief Justice joins, dissenting. Today the Court applies a new rule of retroactivity to impose crushing and unnecessary liability on the States, precisely at a time when they can least afford it. Were the Court's decision the product of statutory or constitutional command, I would have no choice but to join it. But nothing in the Constitution or statute requires us to adopt the retroactivity rule the majority now applies. In fact, longstanding precedent requires the opposite result. Because I see no reason to abandon our traditional retroactivity analysis as articulated in Chevron Oil Co. v. Huson, 404 U. S. 97, 106 107 (1971), and because I believe the Supreme Court of Virginia correctly applied Chevron Oil in this case, I would affirm the judgment below. I This Court's retroactivity jurisprudence has become somewhat chaotic in recent years. Three Terms ago, the case of American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith, 496 U. S. 167 (1990), produced three opinions, none of which garnered a majority. One Term later, James B. Beam Distilling Co. v. Georgia, 501 U. S. 529 (1991), yielded five opinions; there, no single writing carried more than three votes. As a result, the Court today finds itself confronted with such disarray that, rather than relying on precedent, it must resort to vote counting: Examining the various opinions in Jim Beam, it discerns six votes for a single proposition that, in its view, controls this case. Ante, at 96-97. If we had given appropriate weight to the principle of stare decisis in the first place, our retroactivity jurisprudence never would have become so hopelessly muddled. After all, it was not that long ago that the law of retroactivity for civil cases was considered well settled. In Chevron Oil Co. , we explained that whether a decision will be nonretroactive depends on whether it announces a new rule, whether prospectivity would undermine the purposes of the *114 rule, and whether retroactive application would produce injustice. 404 U. S., at 106-107. Even when this Court adjusted the retroactivity rule for criminal cases on direct review some six years ago, we reaffirmed the vitality of Chevron Oil, noting that retroactivity in civil cases \"continues to be governed by the standard announced in Chevron Oil Co. v. Huson. \" Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U. S. 314, 322, n. 8 (1987). In American Trucking Assns., supra, however, a number of Justices expressed a contrary view, and the jurisprudential equivalent of entropy immediately took over. Whatever the merits of any retroactivity test, it cannot be denied that resolution of the case before us would be simplified greatly had we not disregarded so needlessly our obligation to follow precedent in the first place. I fear that the Court today, rather than rectifying that confusion, reinforces it still more. In the usual case, of course, retroactivity is not an issue; the courts simply apply their best understanding of current law in resolving each case that comes before them. James B. Beam, 501 U. S., at 534, 535-536 (Souter, J.). But where the law changes in some respect, the courts sometimes may elect not to apply the new law; instead, they apply the law that governed when the events giving rise to the suit took place, especially where the change in law is abrupt and the parties may have relied on the prior law. See id., at 534. This can be done in one of two ways. First, a court may choose to make the decision purely prospective, refusing to apply it not only to the parties before the court but also to any case where the relevant facts predate the decision. Id., at 536. Second, a court may apply the rule to some but not all cases where the operative events occurred before the court's decision, depending on the equities. See id., at 537. The first option is called \"pure prospectivity\" and the second \"selective prospectivity.\" As the majority notes, ante, at 96-97, six Justices in James B. Beam, supra, expressed their disagreement with selective prospectivity. Thus, even though there was no majority *115 opinion in that case, one can derive from that case the proposition the Court announces today: Once \"this Court applies a rule of federal law to the parties before it,that rule .. . must be given full retroactive effect in all cases still open on direct review.\" Ante, at 97. But no decision of this Court forecloses the possibility of pure prospectivityrefusal to apply a new rule in the very case in which it is announced and every case thereafter. As Justice White explained in his concurrence in James B. Beam, \"[t]he propriety of prospective application of decision in this Court, in both constitutional and statutory cases, is settled by our prior decisions.\" 501 U. S., at 546 (opinion concurring in judgment). Rather than limiting its pronouncements to the question of selective prospectivity, the Court intimates that pure prospectivity may be prohibited as well. See ante, at 97 (referring to our lack of \"`constitutional authority . . . to disregard current law' \"); ibid. (relying on \"`basic norms of constitutional adjudication' \" (quoting Griffith, supra, at 322)); see also ante, at 94 (touting the \"fundamental rule of `retrospective operation' \" of judicial decisions). The intimation is incorrect. As I have explained before and will touch upon only briefly here: \"[W]hen the Court changes its mind, the law changes with it. If the Court decides, in the context of a civil case or controversy, to change the law, it must make [a] determination whether the new law or the old is to apply to conduct occurring before the law-changing decision. Chevron Oil describes our long-established procedure for making this inquiry.\" James B. Beam, supra, at 550 (O'Connor, J., dissenting) (internal quotation marks omitted). Nor can the Court's suggestion be squared with our cases, which repeatedly have announced rules of purely prospective effect. See, e. g., Northern Pipeline Constr. Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co., 458 U. S. 50, 88 (1982); Chevron Oil, 404 *116 U. S., at 106-107; Phoenix v. Kolodziejski, 399 U. S. 204, 214 (1970); Cipriano v. City of Houma, 395 U. S. 701, 706 (1969); see also American Trucking Assns., 496 U. S., at 188-200 (plurality opinion) (canvassing the Court's retroactivity jurisprudence); ante, at 110 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (citing cases). In any event, the question of pure prospectivity is not implicated here. The majority first holds that once a rule has been applied retroactively, the rule must be applied retroactively to all cases thereafter. Ante, at 97. Then it holds that Davis v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury, 489 U. S. 803 (1989), in fact retroactively applied the rule it announced. Ante, at 98-99. Under the majority's approach, that should end the matter: Because the Court applied the rule retroactively in Davis, it must do so here as well. Accordingly, there is no reason for the Court's careless dictum regarding pure prospectivity, much less dictum that is contrary to clear precedent. Plainly enough, Justice Scalia would cast overboard our entire retroactivity doctrine with precisely the \"unceremonious `heave-ho' \" he decries in his concurrence. See ante, at 109. Behind the undisguised hostility to an era whose jurisprudence he finds distasteful, Justice Scalia raises but two substantive arguments, both of which were raised in James B. Beam , 501 U. S., at 549 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment), and neither of which has been adopted by a majority of this Court. Justice White appropriately responded to those arguments then, see id., at 546 (opinion concurring in judgment), and there is no reason to repeat the responses now. As Justice Frankfurter explained more than 35 years ago: \"We should not indulge in the fiction that the law now announced has always been the law . . . . It is much more conducive to law's self-respect to recognize candidly the considerations that give prospective content to *117 a new pronouncement of law.\" Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U. S. 12, 26 (1956) (opinion concurring in judgment). II I dissented in James B. Beam because I believed that the absolute prohibition on selective prospectivity was not only contrary to precedent, but also so rigid that it produced unconscionable results. I would have adhered to the traditional equitable balancing test of Chevron Oil as the appropriate method of deciding the retroactivity question in individual cases. But even if one believes the prohibition on selective prospectivity desirable, it seems to me that the Court today takes that judgment to an illogicaland inequitableextreme. It is one thing to say that, where we have considered prospectivity in a prior case and rejected it, we must reject it in every case thereafter. But it is quite another to hold that, because we did not consider the possibility of prospectivity in a prior case and instead applied a rule retroactively through inadvertence, we are foreclosed from considering the issue forever thereafter. Such a rule is both contrary to established precedent and at odds with any notion of fairness or sound decisional practice. Yet that is precisely the rule the Court appears to adopt today. Ante, at 96-97. A Under the Court's new approach, we have neither authority nor discretion to consider the merits of applying Davis v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury, supra, retroactively. Instead, we must inquire whether any of our previous decisions happened to have applied the Davis rule retroactively to the parties before the Court. Deciding whether we in fact have applied Davis retroactively turns out to be a rather difficult matter. Parsing the language of the Davis opinion, the Court encounters a single sentence it declares determinative: \"The State having conceded that a refund is appropriate in *118 these circumstances, see Brief for Appellee 63, to the extent appellant has paid taxes pursuant to this invalid tax scheme, he is entitled to a refund.\" Id., at 817 (quoted in part, ante, at 98). According to the majority, that sentence constitutes \"`consideration of remedial issues' \" and therefore \"`necessarily' \" indicates that we applied the rule in Davis retroactively to the parties before us. Ante, at 98 (quoting James B. Beam, supra, at 539 (opinion of Souter, J.)). Ironically, respondent and its amici draw precisely the opposite conclusion from the same sentence. According to them, the fact that Michigan conceded that it would offer relief meant that we had no reason to decide the question of retroactivity in Davis. Michigan was willing to provide relief whether or not relief was required. The Court simply accepted that offer and preserved the retroactivity question for another day. One might very well debate the meaning of the single sentence on which everyone relies. But the debate is as meaningless as it is indeterminate. In Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U. S. 619 (1993), we reaffirmed our longstanding rule that, if a decision does not \"squarely addres[s] [an] issue,\" this Court remains \"free to address [it] on the merits\" at a later date. Id., at 631. Accord, United States v. L. A. Tucker Truck Lines, Inc., 344 U. S. 33, 38 (1952) (issue not \"raised in briefs or argument nor discussed in the opinion of the Court\" cannot be taken as \"a binding precedent on th[e] point\"); Webster v. Fall, 266 U. S. 507, 511 (1925) (\"Questions which merely lurk in the record, neither brought to the attention of the court nor ruled upon, are not considered as having been so decided as to constitute precedents\"). The rule can be traced back to some of the earliest of this Court's decisions. See statement of Marshall, C. J.,as reported in the arguments of counsel in United States v. More, 3 Cranch 159, 172 (1805) (\"No question was made, in that case, as to the jurisdiction. It passed sub silentio, and the court does not consider itself as bound by that case\"). Regardless of *119 how one reads the solitary sentence upon which the Court relies, surely it does not \"squarely address\" the question of retroactivity; it does not even mention retroactivity. At best, by addressing the question of remedies, the sentence implicitly \"assumes\" the rule in Davis to be retroactive. Our decision in Brecht, however, makes it quite clear that unexamined assumptions do not bind this Court. Brecht, supra, at 631 (That the Court \"assumed the applicability of\" a rule does not bind the Court to the assumption). In fact, there is far less reason to consider ourselves bound by precedent today than there was in Brecht. In Brecht, the issue was not whether a legal question was resolved by a single case; it was whether our consistent practice of applying a particular rule, Chapman v. California, 386 U. S. 18, 24 (1967), to cases on collateral review precluded us from limiting the rule's application to cases on direct review. Because none of our prior cases directly had addressed the applicability of Chapman to cases on collateral revieweach had only assumed it appliedthe Court held that those cases did not bind us to any particular result. See Brecht, supra, at 630-631. I see no reason why a single retroactive application of the Davis rule, inferred from the sparse and ambiguous language of Davis itself, should carry more weight here than our consistent practice did in Brecht. The Court offers no justification for disregarding the settled rule we so recently applied in Brecht. Nor do I believe it could, for the rule is not a procedural nicety. On the contrary, it is critical to the soundness of our decisional processes. It should go without saying that any decision of this Court has wide-ranging applications; nearly every opinion we issue has effects far beyond the particular case in which it issues. The rule we applied in Brecht, which limits the stare decisis effect of our decisions to questions actually considered and passed on, ensures that this Court does not decide important questions by accident or inadvertence. By adopting a contrary rule in the area of retroactivity, the *120 Court now permanently binds itself to its every unexamined assumption or inattention. Any rule that creates a grave risk that we might resolve important issues of national concern sub silentio, without thought or consideration, cannot be a wise one. This case demonstrates the danger of such a rule. The question of retroactivity was never briefed in Davis. It had not been passed upon by the court below. And it was not within the question presented. Indeed, at oral argument we signaled that we would not pass upon the retroactivity of the rule Davis would announce. After conceding that the Michigan Department of Taxation would give Davis himself a refund if he prevailed, counsel for the department argued that it would be unfair to require Michigan to provide refunds to the 24,000 taxpayers who were not before the Court. The following colloquy ensued: \"[Court]: So why do we have to answer that at all? \"[Michigan]: if, if this Court issues an opinion stating that the current Michigan classification is unconstitutional or in violation of the statute, there are these 24,000 taxpayers out there.. . . . . \"[Court]: But that's notit's not here, is it? Is that question here? \"[Michigan]: It is not specifically raised, no.\" Tr. of Oral Arg., O. T. 1988, No. 87-1020, pp. 37-38. Now, however, the Court holds that the question was implicitly before us and that, even though the Davis opinion does not even discuss the question of retroactivity, it resolved the issue conclusively and irretrievably. If Davis somehow did decide that its rule was to be retroactive, it was by chance and not by design. The absence of briefing, argument, or even mention of the question belies any suggestion that the issue was given thoughtful consideration. Even the author of the Davis opinion refuses to accept *121 the notion that Davis resolved the question of retroactivity. Instead, Justice Kennedy applies the analysis of Chevron Oil to resolve the retroactivity question today. See ante, at 110-112 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment). The Court's decision today cannot be justified by comparison to our decision in Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U. S. 314 (1987), which abandoned selective prospectivity in the criminal context. Ante, at 97. As I explained in American Trucking Assns., 496 U. S., at 197-200, there are significant differences between criminal and civil cases that weigh against such an extension. First, nonretroactivity in criminal cases historically has favored the government's reliance interests over the rights of criminal defendants. As a result, the generalized policy of favoring individual rights over governmental prerogative can justify the elimination of prospectivity in the criminal arena. The same rationale cannot apply in civil cases, as nonretroactivity in the civil context does not necessarily favor plaintiffs or defendants; \"nor is there any policy reason for protecting one class of litigants over another.\" Id., at 198. More important, even a party to civil litigation who is \"deprived of the full retroactive benefit of a new decision may receive some relief.\" Id., at 198 199. Here, for example, petitioners received the benefit of prospective invalidation of Virginia's taxing scheme. From this moment forward, they will be treated on an equal basis with all other retirees, the very treatment our intergovernmental immunity cases require. The criminal defendant, in contrast, is usually interested only in one remedyreversal of his conviction. That remedy can be obtained only if the rule is applied retroactively. See id. , at 199. Nor can the Court's rejection of selective retroactivity in the civil context be defended on equal treatment grounds. See Griffith, supra, at 323 (selective retroactivity accords a benefit to the defendant in whose case the decision is announced but not to any defendant thereafter). It may well *122 be that there is little difference between the criminal defendant in whose case a decision is announced and the defendant who seeks certiorari on the same question two days later. But in this case there is a tremendous difference between the defendant in whose case the Davis rule was announced and the defendant who appears before us today: The latter litigated and preserved the retroactivity question while the former did not. The Michigan Department of Taxation did not even brief the question of retroactivity in Davis. Respondent, in contrast, actually prevailed on the question in the court below. If the Court is concerned with equal treatment, that difference should be dispositive. Having failed to demand the unusual, prospectivity, respondent in Davis got the usual namely, retroactivity. Respondent in this case has asked for the unusual. In fact, respondent here defends a judgment below that awarded it just that. I do not see how the principles of equality can support forcing the Commonwealth of Virginia to bear the harsh consequences of retroactivity simply because, years ago, the Michigan Department of Taxation failed to press the issueand we neglected to consider it. Instead, the principles of fairness favor addressing the contentions the Virginia Department of Taxation presses before us by applying Chevron Oil today. It is therefore to Chevron Oil that I now turn. B Under Chevron Oil, whether a decision of this Court will be applied nonretroactively depends on three factors. First, as a threshold matter, \"the decision to be applied nonretroactively must establish a new principle of law.\" 404 U. S., at 106. Second, nonretroactivity must not retard the new rule's operation in light of its history, purpose, and effect. Id., at 107. Third, nonretroactivity must be necessary to avoid the substantial injustice and hardship that a holding of retroactivity might impose. Ibid. In my view, all three factors favor holding our decision in Davis nonretroactive. *123 1 As Justice Kennedy points out in his concurrence, ante, at 111, a decision cannot be made nonretroactive unless it announces \"a new principle of law.\" Chevron Oil, 404 U. S., at 106. For purposes of civil retroactivity, Chevron Oil identifies two types of decisions that can be new. First, a decision is new if it overturns \"clear past precedent on which litigants may have relied.\" Ibid.; ante, at 111 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). I agree with Justice Kennedy that Davis did not represent such a \"`revolutionary' \" or \"`avulsive change' \" in the law. Ante, at 112 (quoting Hanover Shoe, Inc. v. United Shoe Machinery Corp., 392 U. S. 481, 499 (1968)). Nonetheless, Chevron also explains that a decision may be \"new\" if it resolves \"an issue of first impression whose resolution was not clearly foreshadowed.\" Chevron Oil, supra, at 106 (emphasis added). Thus, even a decision that is \"controlled by the . . . principles\" articulated in precedent may announce a new rule, so long as the rule was \"sufficiently debatable\" in advance. Arizona Governing Comm. for Tax Deferred Annuity and Deferred Compensation Plans v. Norris, 463 U. S. 1073, 1109 (1983) (O'Connor, J., concurring). Reading the Davis opinion alone, one might get the impression that it did not announce a new rule even of that variety. The opinion's emphatic language suggests that the outcome was not even debatable. See ante, at 111 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). In my view, however, assertive language is not itself determinative. As The Chief Justice explained for the Court in a different context: \"[T]he fact that a court says that its decision . . . is `controlled' by a prior decision, is not conclusive for purposes of deciding whether the current decision is a `new rule' . . . . Courts frequently view their decisions as being `controlled' or `governed' by prior opinions even *124 when aware of reasonable contrary conclusions reached by other courts.\" Butler v. McKellar, 494 U. S. 407, 415 (1990). In Butler, we determined that the rule announced in Arizona v. Roberson, 486 U. S. 675 (1988), was \"new\" for purposes of Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989), despite Roberson `s repeated assertions that its rule was \"directly controlled\" by precedent. Indeed, we did not even feel bound by the opinion's statement that it was not announcing a new rule at all but rather declining to create an exception to an existing rule. While Teague and its progeny may not provide the appropriate standard of novelty for Chevron Oil purposes, their teachingthat whether an opinion is new depends not on its language or tone but on the legal landscape from which it aroseobtains nonetheless. In any event, Justice Stevens certainly thought that Davis announced a new rule. In fact, he thought that the rule was not only unprecedented, but wrong: \"The Court's holding is not supported by the rationale for the intergovernmental immunity doctrine and is not compelled by our previous decisions. I cannot join the unjustified, court-imposed restriction on a State's power to administer its own affairs.\" 489 U. S., at 818-819 (dissenting opinion). And just last Term two Members of this Court expressed their disagreement with the decision in Davis, labeling its application of the doctrine of intergovernmental immunity \"perverse.\" Barker v. Kansas, 503 U. S. 594, 606 (1992) (Stevens, J., joined by Thomas, J., concurring). Although I would not call our decision in Davis perverse, I agree that its rule was sufficiently debatable in advance as to fall short of being \"clearly foreshadowed.\" The great weight of authority is in accord.[*] *125 In fact, before Davis was announced, conventional wisdom seemed to be directly to the contrary. One would think that, if Davis was \"clearly foreshadowed,\" some taxpayer might have made the intergovernmental immunity argument before. No one had. Twenty-three States had taxation schemes just like the one at issue in Davis; and some of those schemes were established as much as half a century before Davis was decided. See Harper v. Virginia Dept. of Taxation, 241 Va. 232, 237, 401 S. E. 2d 868, 871 (1991). Yet not a single taxpayer ever challenged one of those schemes on intergovernmental immunity grounds until Davis challenged Michigan's in 1984. If Justice Holmes is correct that \"[t]he prophecies of what the courts will do in fact, and nothing more pretentious\" are \"law,\" O. Holmes, The Path of the Law, in Collected Legal Papers 167, 173 (1920), then surely Davis announced new law; the universal \"prophecy\" before Davis seemed to be that such taxation schemes were valid. An examination of the decision in Davis and its predecessors reveals that Davis was anything but clearly foreshadowed. Of course, it was well established long before Davis that the nondiscrimination principle of 4 U. S. C. § 111 and the doctrine of intergovernmental immunity prohibit a State from imposing a discriminatory tax on the United States or *126 those who do business with it. The income tax at issue in Davis, however, did not appear discriminatory on its face. Like the Virginia income tax at issue here, it did not single out federal employees or retirees for disfavored treatment. Instead, federal retirees were treated identically to all other retirees, with a single and numerically insignificant exceptionretirees whose retirement benefits were paid by the State. Whether such an exception rendered the tax \"discriminatory\" within the meaning of the intergovernmental immunity doctrine, it seems to me, was an open question. On the one hand, the tax scheme did distinguish between federal retirees and state retirees: The former were required to pay state taxes on their retirement income, while the latter were not. But it was far from clear that such was the proper comparison. In fact, there were strong arguments that it was not. As Justice Stevens explained more thoroughly in his Davis dissent, 489 U. S., at 819and as we have recognized since McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316 (1819)intergovernmental immunity is necessary to prevent the States from interfering with federal interests through taxation. Because the National Government has no recourse to the state ballot box, it has only a limited ability to protect itself against excessive state taxes. But the risk of excessive taxation of federal interests is eliminated, and \"[a] `political check' is provided, when a state tax falls\" not only on the Federal Government, but also \"on a significant group of state citizens who can be counted upon to use their votes to keep the State from raising the tax excessively, and thus placing an unfair burden on the Federal Government.\" Washington v. United States, 460 U. S. 536, 545 (1983) (emphasis added). Accord, United States v. County of Fresno, 429 U. S. 452, 462-464 (1977); South Carolina v. Baker, 485 U. S. 505, 526, n. 15 (1988). There can be no doubt that the taxation scheme at issue in Davis and the one employed by the Commonwealth of *127 Virginia provided that necessary \"political check.\" They exempted only a small group of citizens, state retirees, while subjecting the remainder of their citizensfederal retirees, retirees who receive income from private sources, and nonretirees aliketo a uniform income tax. As a result, any attempt to increase income taxes excessively so as to interfere with federal interests would have caused the similarly taxed populace to \"use their votes\" to protect their interests, thereby protecting the interests of the Federal Government as well. There being no risk of abusive taxation of the National Government, there was a good argument that there should have been no intergovernmental immunity problem either. See Davis, 489 U. S., at 821-824 (Stevens, J., dissenting). In addition, distinguishing between taxation of state retirees and all others, including private and federal retirees, was justifiable from an economic standpoint. The State, after all, does not merely collect taxes from its retirees; it pays their benefits as well. As a result, it makes no difference to the State or the retirees whether the State increases state retirement benefits in an amount sufficient to cover taxes it imposes, or whether the State offers reduced benefits and makes them tax free. The net income level of the retirees and the impact on the state fisc is the same. Thus, the Michigan Department of Taxation had a good argument that its differential treatment of state and federal retirees was \"directly related to, and justified by, [a] significant differenc[e] between the two classes,\" id., at 816 (internal quotation marks omitted): Taxing federal retirees enhances the State's fisc, whereas taxing state retirees does not. I recite these arguments not to show that the decision in Davis was wrongI joined the opinion then and remain of the view that it was correctbut instead to point out that the arguments on the other side were substantial. Of course, the Court was able to \"ancho[r] its decision in precedent,\" ante, at 112 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring *128 in judgment). But surely that cannot be dispositive. Few decisions are so novel that there is no precedent to which they may be moored. What is determinative is that the decision was \"sufficiently debatable\" ex ante that, under Chevron Oil, nonretroactivity cannot be precluded. Arizona Governing Committee v. Norris, 463 U. S., at 1109 (O'Connor, J., concurring). That, it seems to me, is the case here. 2 The second Chevron Oil factor is whether denying the rule retroactive application will retard its operation in light of the rule's history, purpose, and effect. 404 U. S., at 107. That factor overwhelmingly favors respondent. The purpose of the intergovernmental immunity doctrine is to protect the rights of the Federal Sovereign against state interference. It does not protect the private rights of individuals: \"[T]he purpose of the immunity was not to confer benefits on the employees by relieving them from contributing their share of the financial support of the other government . . . , but to prevent undue interference with the one government by imposing on it the tax burdens of the other.\" Graves v. New York ex rel. O'Keefe, 306 U. S. 466, 483-484 (1939) (footnote omitted). Accord, Davis, supra, at 814 (\"[I]ntergovernmental tax immunity is based on the need to protect each sovereign's governmental operations from undue interference by the other\"). Affording petitioners retroactive relief in this case would not vindicate the interests of the Federal Government. Instead, it lines the pockets of the Government's former employees. It therefore comes as no surprise that the United States, despite its consistent participation in intergovernmental immunity cases in the past, has taken no position here. Because retroactive application of the rule in Davis serves petitioners' interests but not the interests intergovernmental *129 immunity was meant to protectthe Federal Government'sdenying Davis retroactive application would not undermine the decision's purpose or effect. 3 The final factor under Chevron Oil is whether the decision \"`could produce substantial inequitable results if applied retroactively.' \" Chevron Oil, supra, at 107 (quoting Cipriano v. City of Houma, 395 U. S., at 706). We repeatedly have declined to give our decisions retroactive effect where doing so would be unjust. In Arizona Governing Committee v. Norris, supra, for example, we declined to apply a Title VII decision retroactively, noting that the resulting \"unanticipated financial burdens would come at a time when many States and local governments are struggling to meet substantial fiscal deficits.\" Id., at 1106-1107 (Powell, J., joined by Burger, C. J., Blackmun, Rehnquist, and O'Connor, JJ.). There was \"no justification\" for \"impos[ing] this magnitude of burden retroactively on the public,\" we concluded. Id., at 1107. Accord, id., at 1107-1111 (O'Connor, J., concurring); see id., at 1075 (per curiam). Similarly, we declined to afford the plaintiff full retroactive relief in Los Angeles Dept. of Water and Power v. Manhart, 435 U. S. 702, 718-723 (1978) (Stevens, J.). There, too, we explained that \"[r]etroactive liability could be devastating\" and that \"[t]he harm would fall in large part on innocent third parties.\" Id. , at 722-723. Those same considerations exist here. Retroactive application of rulings that invalidate state tax laws have the potential for producing \"disruptive consequences for the State[s] and [their] citizens. A refund, if required by state or federal law, could deplete the state treasur[ies], thus threatening the State[s'] current operations and future plans.\" American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith, 496 U. S., at 182 (plurality opinion). Retroactive application of Davis is no exception. \"The fiscal implications of Davis for the *130 [S]tates,\" one commentator has noted, \"are truly staggering.\" Hellerstein, Preliminary Reflections on McKesson and American Trucking Associations, 48 Tax Notes 325, 336 (1990). The States estimate that their total liability will exceed $1.8 billion. Brief for Respondent SA-1; Brief for State of Utah et al. as Amici Curiae 12-13. Virginia's share alone exceeds $440 million. Brief for Respondent SA-1; Brief for State of Utah et al. as Amici Curiae 12-13. This massive liability could not come at a worse time. See Wall Street Journal, July 27, 1992, p. A2 (\"Most states are in dire fiscal straits, and their deteriorating tax base is making it harder for them to get out, a survey of legislatures indicates\"). Accord, Harper v. Virginia Dept. of Taxation, 241 Va., at 239-240, 401 S. E. 2d, at 873 (such massive liability \"would have a potentially disruptive and destructive impact on the Commonwealth's planning, budgeting, and delivery of essential state services\"); Swanson v. State, 329 N. C. 576, 583, 407 S. E. 2d 791, 794 (1991) (\"this State is in dire financial straits\" and $140 million in refunds would exacerbate it); Bass v. State, 302 S. C. 250, 256, 395 S. E. 2d 171, 174 (1990) ($200 million in refunds \"would impose a severe financial burden on the State and its citizens [and] endanger the financial integrity of the State\"). To impose such liability on Virginia and the other States that relied in good faith on their taxation laws, \"at a time when most States are struggling to fund even the most basic services, is the height of unfairness.\" James B. Beam, 501 U. S., at 558 (O'Connor, J., dissenting). It cannot be contended that such a burden is justified by the States' conduct, for the liability is entirely disproportionate to the offense. We do not deal with a State that willfully violated the Constitution but rather one that acted entirely in good faith on the basis of an unchallenged statute. Moreover, during the four years in question, the constitutional violation produced a benefit of approximately $8 million to $12 million per year, Tr. of Oral Arg. 33, 36, and that benefit accrued not to the Commonwealth but to individual retirees. *131 Yet, for that $32 million to $48 million error, the Court now allows the imposition of liability well in excess of $400 million dollars. Such liability is more than just disproportionate; it is unconscionable. Finally and perhaps most important, this burden will not fall on some thoughtless government official or even the group of retirees that benefited from the offending exemption. Instead the burden falls squarely on the backs of the blameless and unexpecting taxpayers of the affected States who, although they profited not at all from the exemption, will now be forced to pay higher taxes and be deprived of essential services. Petitioners, in contrast, would suffer no hardship if the Court refused to apply Davis retroactively. For years, 23 States enforced taxation schemes like the Commonwealth's in good faith, and for years not a single taxpayer objected on intergovernmental immunity grounds. No one put the States on notice that their taxing schemes might be constitutionally suspect. Denying Davis retroactive relief thus would not deny petitioners a benefit on which they had relied. It merely would deny them an unanticipated windfall. Because that windfall would come only at the cost of imposing hurtful consequences on innocent taxpayers and the communities in which they live, I believe the substantial inequity of imposing retroactive relief in this case, like the other Chevron factors, weighs in favor of denying Davis retroactive application. III Even if the Court is correct that Davis must be applied retroactively in this case, there is the separate question of the remedy that must be given. The questions of retroactivity and remedy are analytically distinct. American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith, supra, at 189 (plurality opinion) (\"[T]he Court has never equated its retroactivity principles with remedial principles\"). As Justice Souter explained in James B. Beam, supra, at 534, retroactivity is a matter of choice of law \"[s]ince the question is whether the court *132 should apply the old rule or the new one.\" When the retroactivity of a decision of this Court is in issue, the choice-oflaw issue is a federal question. Ashland Oil, Inc. v. Caryl, 497 U. S. 916, 918 (1990) (per curiam). The question of remedy, however, is quite different. The issue is not whether to apply new law or old law, but what relief should be afforded once the prevailing party has been determined under applicable law. See James B. Beam, 501 U. S., at 535 (Souter, J.) (\"Once a rule is found to apply `backward,' there may then be a further issue of remedies, i. e., whether the party prevailing under a new rule should obtain the same relief that would have been awarded if the rule had been an old one\"). The question of remedies is in the first instance a question of state law. See ibid. (\"[T]he remedial inquiry is one governed by state law, at least where the case originates in state court\"). In fact, the only federal question regarding remedies is whether the relief afforded is sufficient to comply with the requirements of due process. See McKesson Corp. v. Division of Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco, Fla. Dept. of Business Regulation, 496 U. S. 18, 31-52 (1990). While the issue of retroactivity is properly before us, the question of remedies is not. It does not appear to be within the question presented, which asks only if Davis may be applied \"nonretroactively so as to defeat federal retirees' entitlement to refunds.\" Pet. for Cert. i. Moreover, our consideration of the question at this juncture would be inappropriate, as the Supreme Court of Virginia has yet to consider what remedy might be available in light of Davis ` retroactivity and applicable state law. The Court inexplicably discusses the question at length nonetheless, noting that if the Commonwealth of Virginia provides adequate predeprivation remedies, it is under no obligation to provide full retroactive refunds today. Ante, at 100-102. When courts take it upon themselves to issue helpful guidance in dictum, they risk creating additional confusion by *133 inadvertently suggesting constitutional absolutes that do not exist. The Court's dictum today follows that course. Amidst its discussion of predeprivation and postdeprivation remedies, the Court asserts that a plaintiff who has been deprived a predeprivation remedy cannot be \"confine[d] . . . to prospective relief.\" Ante, at 101, n. 10. I do not believe the Court's assertion to be correct. Over 20 years ago, Justice Harlan recognized that the equities could be taken into account in determining the appropriate remedy when the Court announces a new rule of constitutional law: \"To the extent that equitable considerations, for example, `reliance,' are relevant, I would take this into account in the determination of what relief is appropriate in any given case. There are, of course, circumstances when a change in the law will jeopardize an edifice which was reasonably constructed on the foundation of prevailing legal doctrine.\" United States v. Estate of Don- nelly, 397 U. S. 286, 296 (1970) (concurring opinion). The commentators appear to be in accord. See Fallon &amp; Meltzer, New Law, Non-Retroactivity, and Constitutional Remedies, 104 Harv. L. Rev. 1733 (1991) (urging consideration of novelty and hardship as part of the remedial framework rather than as a question of whether to apply old law or new). In my view, and in light of the Court's revisions to the law of retroactivity, it should be constitutionally permissible for the equities to inform the remedial inquiry. In a particularly compelling case, then, the equities might permit a State to deny taxpayers a full refund despite having refused them predeprivation process. Indeed, some Members of this Court have argued that we recognized as much long ago. In American Trucking Assns., 496 U. S., at 219-224 (dissenting opinion), Justice Stevens admitted that this Court repeatedly had applied the Chevron Oil factors to preclude the provision of monetary *134 relief. In Justice Stevens' view, however, Chevron Oil determined the question of remedy rather than which law would apply, new or old. See 496 U. S., at 220 (Chevron Oil and its progeny \"establish a remedial principle for the exercise of equitable discretion by federal courts and not, as the plurality states, a choice-of-law principle applicable to all cases on direct review\"); see also ante, at 95, n. 9 (reserving the possibility that Chevron Oil governs the question of remedies in federal court). If Justice Stevens' view or something like it has prevailed todayand it seems that it hasthen state and federal courts still retain the ability to exercise their \"equitable discretion\" in formulating appropriate relief on a federal claim. After all, it would be wholly anomalous to suggest that federal courts are permitted to determine the scope of the remedy by reference to Chevron Oil, but that state courts are barred from considering the equities altogether. Not only would that unduly restrict state court \"flexibility in the law of remedies,\" Estate of Donnelly, supra, at 297 (Harlan, J., concurring), but it also would turn federalism on its head. I know of no principle of law that permits us to restrict the remedial discretion of state courts without imposing similar restrictions on federal courts. Quite the opposite should be true, as the question of remedies in state court is generally a question of state law in the first instance. James B. Beam, 501 U. S., at 535 (Souter, J.). The Court cites only a single case that might be read as precluding courts from considering the equities when selecting the remedy for the violation of a novel constitutional rule. That case is McKesson Corp. v. Division of Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco, supra. Ante, at 101-102. But, as the controlling opinion in James B. Beam explains, McKesson cannot be so read. 501 U. S., at 544 (\"Nothing we say here [precludes the right] to raise procedural bars to recovery under state law or demonstrate reliance interests entitled to consideration in determining the nature of the remedy that must be provided, a matter with which McKes- *135 son did not deal \" (emphases added)). Accord, id., at 543 (\"[N]othing we say here precludes consideration of individual equities when deciding remedial issues in particular cases\"). It is true that the Court in McKesson rejected, on due process grounds, the State of Florida's equitable arguments against the requirement of a full refund. But the opinion did not hold that those arguments were irrelevant as a categorical matter. It simply held that the equities in that case were insufficient to support the decision to withhold a remedy. The opinion expressly so states, rejecting the State's equitable arguments as insufficiently \"weighty in these circumstances. \" McKesson, 496 U. S., at 45 (emphasis added). The circumstances in McKesson were quite different than those here. In McKesson, the tax imposed was patently unconstitutional: The State of Florida collected taxes under its Liquor Tax statute even though this Court already had invalidated a \"virtually identical\" tax. Id., at 46. Given that the State could \"hardly claim surprise\" that its statute was declared invalid, this Court concluded that the State's reliance on the presumptive validity of its statute was insufficient to preclude monetary relief. Ibid. As we explained in American Trucking Assns., the large burden of retroactive relief is \"largely irrelevant when a State violates constitutional norms well established under existing precedent.\" We cited McKesson as an example. 496 U. S., at 183 (plurality opinion). A contrary reading of McKesson would be anomalous in light of this Court's immunity jurisprudence. The Federal Government, for example, is absolutely immune from suit absent an express waiver of immunity; and federal officers enjoy at least qualified immunity when sued in a Bivens action. Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388 (1971). As a result, an individual who suffers a constitutional deprivation at the hands of a federal officer very well may have no access to backwards-looking (monetary) relief. I do not see why the Due Process Clause would *136 require a full, backwards-looking compensatory remedy whenever a governmental official reasonably taxes a citizen under what later turns out to be an unconstitutional statute but not where the officer deprives a citizen of her bodily integrity or her life. In my view, ifthe Court is going to restrict authority to temper hardship by holding our decisions nonretroactive through the Chevron Oil factors, it must afford courts the ability to avoid injustice by taking equity into account when formulating the remedy for violations of novel constitutional rules. See Fallon &amp; Meltzer, 104 Harv. L. Rev. 1733 (1991). Surely the Constitution permits this Court to refuse plaintiffs full backwards-looking relief under Chevron Oil; we repeatedly have done so in the past. American Trucking Assns., supra, at 188-200 (canvassing the Court's practice); see also supra, at 115-116, 129. I therefore see no reason why it would not similarly permit state courts reasonably to consider the equities in the exercise of their sound remedial discretion. IV In my view, the correct approach to the retroactivity question before us was articulated in Chevron Oil some 22 years ago. By refusing to apply Chevron Oil today, the Court not only permits the imposition of grave and gratuitous hardship on the States and their citizens, but also disregards settled precedents central to the fairness and accuracy of our decisional processes. Nor does the Court cast any light on the nature of the regime that will govern from here on. To the contrary, the Court's unnecessary innuendo concerning pure prospectivity and ill-advised dictum regarding remedial issues introduce still greater uncertainty and disorder into this already chaotic area. Because I cannot agree with the Court's decision or the manifestly unjust results it appears to portend, I respectfully dissent.

S. 263 (1967)). [9] We need not debate whether Chevron Oil represents a true \"choice-oflaw principle\" or merely \"a remedial principle for the exercise of equitable discretion by federal courts.\" American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith, 496 U. S. 167, 220 (1990) (Stevens, J., dissenting). Compare id., at 191 197 (plurality opinion) (treating Chevron Oil as a choice-of-law rule), with id., at 218-224 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (treating Chevron Oil as a remedial doctrine). Regardless of how Chevron Oil is characterized, our decision today makes it clear that \"the Chevron Oil test cannot determine the choice of law by relying on the equities of the particular case\" and that the federal law applicable to a particular case does not turn on \"whether [litigants] actually relied on [an] old rule [or] how they would suffer from retroactive application\" of a new one. James B. Beam Distilling Co. v. Georgia, 501 U. S. 529, 543 (1991) (opinion of Souter, J.). [10] A State incurs this obligation when it \"places a taxpayer under duress promptly to pay a tax when due and relegates him to a postpayment refund action in which he can challenge the tax's legality.\" McKesson, 496 U. S., at 31. A State that \"establish[es] various sanctions and summary remedies designed\" to prompt taxpayers to \"tender . . . payments before their objections are entertained and resolved\" does not provide taxpayers \"a meaningful opportunity to withhold payment and to obtain a predeprivation determination of the tax assessment's validity.\" Id., at 38 (emphasis in original). Such limitations impose constitutionally significant \"`duress'\" because a tax payment rendered under these circumstances must be treated as an effort \"to avoid financial sanctions or a seizure of real or personal property.\" Id., at 38, n. 21. The State accordingly may not confine a taxpayer under duress to prospective relief. [1] The dissent attempts to distinguish between retroactivity in civil and criminal settings on three grounds, none of which has ever been adopted by this Court. The dissent's first argument begins with the observation that \"nonretroactivity in criminal cases historically has favored the government's reliance interests over the rights of criminal defendants.\" Post, at 121. But while it is true that prospectivity was usually employed in the past (during the brief period when it was used in criminal cases) to favor the government, there is no basis for the implicit suggestion that it would usually favor the government in the future. That phenomenon was a consequence, not of the nature of the doctrine, cf. James v. United States, 366 U. S. 213 (1961), but of the historical \"accident\" that during the period prospectivity was in fashion legal rules favoring the government were more frequently overturned. But more fundamentally, to base a rule of full retroactivity in the criminal-law area upon what the dissent calls \"the generalized policy of favoring individual rights over governmental prerogative,\" post, at 121, makes no more sense than to adopt, because of the same \"generalized policy,\" a similarly gross rule that no decision favoring criminal defendants can ever be overruled. The law is more discerning than that. The dissent's next argument is based on the dubious empirical assumption that civil litigants, but not criminal defendants, will often receive some benefit from a prospective decision. That assumption does not hold even in this case: Prospective invalidation of Virginia's taxing scheme would afford petitioners the enormous future \"benefit,\" ibid., of knowing that others in the State are being taxed more. But empirical problems aside, the dissent does not explain why, if a receipt-of-some-benefit principle is important, we should use such an inaccurate proxy as the civil/criminal distinction, or how this newly discovered principle overcomes the \"basic norms of constitutional adjudication\" on which Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U. S. 314, 322 (1987), rested. Finally, the dissent's \"equal treatment\" argument ably distinguishes between cases in which a prospectivity claim is properly raised, and those in which it is not. See post, at 122. But that does nothing to distinguish between civil and criminal cases; obviously, a party may procedurally default on a claim in either context. [2] Contrary to the suggestion in the dissent, I am not arguing that we should \"cast overboard our entire retroactivity doctrine with . . . [an] unceremonious heave-ho.\" Post, at 116 (emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted). There is no need. We cast over the first half six Terms ago in Griffith, and deep-sixed most of the rest two Terms ago in James B. Beam Distilling Co. v. Georgia, 501 U. S.529 (1991)in neither case unceremoniously (in marked contrast to some of the overrulings cited in text). What little, if any, remains is teetering at the end of the plank and needs no more than a gentle nudge. But if the entire doctrine had been given a quick and unceremonious end, there could be no complaint on the grounds of stare decisis; as it was born, so should it die. I do not know the basis for the dissent's contention that I find the jurisprudence of the era that produced the doctrine of prospectivity \"distasteful.\" Post, at 116. Much of it is quite appetizing. It is only the cavalier treatment of stare decisis and the invention of prospectivity that I have criticized here. [*] Swanson v.

                                                                                                                                                      \\n\\n \\n   *18\\n   \\n  MR. Justice Black\\n \\n\\n  delivered the opinion of the Court.\\n \\n\\n  By the Raker Act of December 19, 1913,\\n  \\n   1\\n  \\n  Congress granted the City and County of San Francisco,\\n  \\n   2\\n  \\n  subject to express conditions, certain lands and rights-of-way in the public domain in Yosemite National Park and Stanis-laus National Forest. The Act in terms declared that this, known as the “Hetch-Hetchy” grant, was intended for use by the City both in constructing and maintaining *a means of supplying water for the ■'domestic purposes of the City and other public bodies, and in establishing a system “for generation and sale and distribution of electric energy.”\\n \\n\\n  Upon application of the Secretary of the Interior, the United States brought this suit\\n  \\n   3\\n  \\n  in equity charging the City with disposing of power through the Pacific Gas\\n  \\n   &\\n  \\n  Electric Company, a private utility, in violation of § 6 of the granting Act. Section 6 provides “That the grantee [the City] is prohibited from ever selling or letting to any corporation or individual, except a municipality or a municipal water district or irrigation district, the right to sell or sublet the water or the electric energy sold or given to it or him by the grantee:\\n  \\n   Provided,\\n  \\n  That the rights hereby granted shall not be sold,\\n   \\n   *19\\n   \\n  assigned, or transferred to any private person, corporation, or association, and in case of any attempt to so sell, assign, transfer, or convey, this grant shall revert to the Government of the United States.”\\n \\n\\n  The District Court concluded that the City was violating § 6 by the sale and distribution of Hetch-Hetchy power through the Pacific Gas & Electric Company, a private utility. Accordingly, the City was required by injunction alternatively to discontinue such disposal of the power or cease further use of the. lands and rights granted it under the Act for generation and transmission of electric energy.\\n  \\n   4\\n  \\n  The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed,\\n  \\n   5\\n  \\n  finding that the private utility was merely acting as the City’s agent in the sale and distribution of Hetch-Hetchy power and holding that § 6 does not prohibit such sale and distribution of that power by a private utility.\\n \\n\\n  Here, as in the courts below, the City has defended the sale and distribution by Pacific Gas & Electric Company of power originating at Hetch-Hetchy upon the grounds that such disposition does not violate' the prohibitions of § 6; that imposition of these prohibitions was not within the constitutional authority of Congress; and that if § 6 is valid and has been violated, the United States is not entitled to injunctive relief in equity.\\n \\n\\n\\n   First. Prohibitions of Section\\n  \\n  6. — In the City’s view, § 6 does not preclude private utilities from all participation in the ultimate sale and distribution of Hetch-Hetchy power. The City insists that the Section, so construed, does no more than prohibit the City from selling\\n   \\n   *20\\n   \\n  Hetch-Hetchy power to a private utility 'for resale to consumers and therefore permits consignment of the power to the Company, as agent of the City, for sale and distribution. On the contrary, the Government’s position rests upon the claim that Pacific Gas & Electric Company is not in reality selling and distributing Hetch-Hetchy power as consignee and agent but as purchaser for resale; that the grant to the City was made upon the mandatory condition that this power be sold solely and exclusively by the City directly to consumers and without private profit in order to bring it into direct competition with adjacent privately owned utilities; and that § 6 not only withholds the right of selling for resale but also prohibits the City “from ever selling or letting” to any private corporation “the right to sell or sublet the . . . electric energy sold or given to it ... ” by the City. The language of the Act, its background and its history require the construction given § 6 by the Government.\\n \\n\\n  From its provisions,\\n  \\n   6\\n  \\n  it is apparent that the Act conditions the grant upon and contemplates the development, sale and distribution of electrical power by the City itself “for municipal and commercial use” on a scale to be gradually stepped up over a period of years. “The . . . grantee shall develop and use hydroelectric power for the use of its people and shall . . . sell or supply such power for irrigation, pumping, or other beneficial use.” The “right to sell or sublet the . . . electric energy” so generated by the City cannot, as a consequence of § 6, be sold or let. And in case of any attempt to “sell, assign, transfer, or convey [the rights granted], this grant shall revert to the Government of the United States.”\\n \\n\\n  From the statement of the Congressman responsible for the application of the prohibitions of § 6 specifically to\\n   \\n   *21\\n   \\n  electric energy,\\n  \\n   7\\n  \\n  it is clear that as enacted § 6 was understood to prohibit the City from transferring to a private utility the right to sell Hetch-Hetchy power (the Government’s contention) and not merely to forbid sale of power as a commodity for resale, as the City would have us hold:\\n \\n\\n  “Mr. Taylor of Colorado. We have got to let the municipality sell to individuals or consumers.\\n \\n\\n  “Mr. Thomson of Illinois. Yes; but not the right to sell some one else the power.\\n \\n\\n  “Mr. Taylor of Colorado. Supposing that San Francisco sells a certain block, you may say, of its power to Alameda. Has not Alameda got the right to resell that to its inhabitants?\\n \\n\\n  “Mr. Thomson of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, in answering the question of the gentleman from Colorado, I would like to call his attention to the fact that the subject of sale as printed in this section is not the power or the water, but the right to sell the power or the water.\\n \\n\\n\\n   C(\\n  \\n\\n\\n  “Mr. Raker. That [the word “individual”] really is intended to cover any person who might attempt to buy this electric power or right. I think it would cover everybody outside of a corporation, the intention being to prevent anybody getting in and getting a right and sub-letting it.”\\n  \\n   8\\n  \\n\\n\\n  In its Report on the Bill, the House Committee on Public Lands stated that the provision of § 6 “acquiesced in by the grantee, was designed to prevent any monoply or private corporation from hereafter obtaining control of the water supply of San Francisco.”\\n  \\n   9\\n  \\n\\n\\n \\n   *22\\n   \\n  From the congressional debates on the passage of the Raker Act can be read a common understanding both on the part of sponsors of the Bill and its opponents that the grant was to be so conditioned as to require municipal performance of the function of supplying Hetch-Hetchy water and electric power directly to the ultimate consumers, and to prohibit sale or distribution of that power and water by any private corporation or individual.\\n  \\n   10\\n  \\n  On the floor of the House, the following took place between the Bill’s author and other Representatives:\\n \\n\\n  “Mr. Sumners. Does San Francisco own its own lighting plant now?\\n \\n\\n  “Mr. Kahn. No; it does not.\\n \\n\\n  “Mr. Raker. I understand it does not.\\n \\n\\n  “Mr. Kahn. It does not own its own water supply. Its present water supply is furnished by a private company.\\n \\n\\n  “Mr. Raker. The Spring Valley Water System.\\n \\n\\n  “Mr. Sumners. Is it the purpose of this bill to have San Francisco supply electric power and water to its own people?\\n \\n\\n  “Mr. Raker. Yes.\\n \\n\\n  “Mr. Sumners. Or to supply these corporations, which will in turn supply the people? -\\n \\n\\n  “Mr. Raker. Under this bill it is to supply its own inhabitants first. . . .”\\n  \\n   11\\n  \\n\\n\\n  These views were in accord with the recommendation of the then Secretary of the Interior, as set out in the Report of the Public Lands Committee of the House:\\n \\n\\n \\n   *23\\n   \\n  “I think that it is very proper that the Federal Government should use whatever power it has over the public lands, over the parks, and over the forests, to compel the fullest use of these waters, and indirectly to require through its power to make conditions, the lowest possible rate for consumers.”\\n  \\n   12\\n  \\n\\n\\n  The theme — of an intent to require public utilization of Hetch-Hetchy power independently of private utilities — recurred at a later stage of the debate in the House:\\n \\n\\n  “Mr. Gray. ...\\n \\n\\n  “As I understand the bill, it provides for the furnishing of water, and also for power for commercial use. . . .\\n \\n\\n  “. . . if these works here are to be contructed to serve the baseness of commercialism, it is the vilest of all vandalism. My suggestion here to you is to strike out of this bill all the commercial profit. . . .\\n \\n\\n  “Mr. Kent [a Member of the California delegation and a supporter of the measure]. Mr. Chairman, I should like to suggest to the gentleman from Indiana [Mr. Gray] that this bill is strictly drawn in the public interest, that there is no possibility of selfish gain, and that no corporation or individual can obtain any benefit whatsoever from this bill. It is for the benefit of the people of California.”'\\n  \\n   13\\n  \\n\\n\\n  In the Senate, Senator Thomas, a member of the Committee reporting the Bill, said:\\n \\n\\n  “. . . San Francisco needs electric power, and California needs development in electric power just as much as she needs ownership in water, . . .\\n \\n\\n \\n   *24\\n   \\n  “. . . She is anxious to extend her spheres of municipal . usefulness, but she is in the grip of a power monopoly as well as that of the Spring \"Valley Co.\\n \\n\\n  “. . . This scheme appeals to me, Mr. President, so far as the power is concerned, because the city of San Francisco as a municipality will be the owner of it, the manufacturer, the distributor of it.”\\n  \\n   14\\n  \\n\\n\\n  And the words of Senator Norris, also a Member of the reporting Committee and a leading sponsor of the Bill, on the day of its final passage through the Senate, illuminate just what the Raker Act was intended to accomplish:\\n \\n\\n  “. . . I said that I was in favor of this bill to a great extent for the reason that it developed this power. This power will come into competition with the various waterpower companies of California, and there are lots of them there.\\n \\n\\n  “. . . this proposition is to harness that power and to put it to public use not to give it to a private corporation. . . .\\n \\n\\n  “Here is an instance where we are going to give it directly to the people, if we pass this bill. It is going to come into competition with power companies and corporations that have, or will have, if this bill is defeated, almost a monopoly not only in San Francisco but throughout the greater portion of California.\\n \\n\\n\\n   ((\\n  \\n\\n\\n  “These make in all, as I have counted them, 18 corporations controlling the power in the vicinity of Sain Francisco that are under the control of this one corporation. [Pacific Gas & Electric Company.]\\n \\n\\n  “. . . When you sum them all up you will find that they own practically all of the hydroelectric power of the State of California, and this bill, if passed, will bring\\n   \\n   *25\\n   \\n  into competition with them one of the greatest units for the development of power that has ever been developed in the history of the world. It means competition.\\n \\n\\n  “. . . Conservation does not mean dealing out these resources to private capital for gain. It is not necessary to accuse those corporations of doing any wrong; but here will be an instance where the cheapest power on earth will be developed and where it will be sold at cost.”\\n  \\n   15\\n  \\n\\n\\n  Opponents of the Bill themselves recognized that its regulatory conditions were designed to insure distribution of power from Hetch-Hetchy through a municipal system in San Francisco. Before final passage in the Senate, opposition had practically narrowed down to the power provisions of the measure,\\n  \\n   16\\n  \\n  and these provisions contemplated a publicly owned and operated power system.\\n  \\n   17\\n  \\n \\n   *26\\n   \\n  Immediately before the vote in the Senate, Senator Mc-Cumber, opposed to the power provisions of § 6, offered a sweeping amendment which would have omitted that section and all other provisions relating to the generation, sale and distribution of Hetch-Hetchy power.\\n  \\n   18\\n  \\n  But his amendment was defeated.\\n  \\n   19\\n  \\n  And despite this articulate opposition to the policy embodied in its power features, the Act was passed.\\n \\n\\n  To limit the prohibitions of § 6 of the Act narrowly to sales of power for resale without more, as the City asks, would permit evasion and frustration of the purpose of the lawmakers. Congress clearly intended to require— as a condition of its grant — sale and distribution of Hetch-Hetchy power exclusively by San Francisco and municipal agencies directly to consumers in the belief that consumers would thus be afforded power at cheap rates in competition with private power companies, particularly Pacific Gas & Electric Company. It is not the office of the courts to pass upon the justification for that belief or the efficacy of the measures chosen for putting it into effect. Selection of the emphatically expressed purpose embodied in this Act was the appropriate business of the legislative body.\\n \\n\\n \\n   *27\\n   \\n  The admitted facts shown by this record required the District Court to find — as it did — that the City was violating § 6 in permitting sale and distribution of Hetch-Hetchy power by the Pacific Gas & Electric Company. Now, as it has been doing since contracting with the City in 1925, the Company sells and distributes that power as follows:\\n \\n\\n  Power generated in the City’s plant is transmitted to the Company at Newark, about thirty-five miles from San Francisco. There the power is delivered to the Company’s sub-station and thereafter is under the Company’s complete control. The Company distributes and sells this power to its customers in San Francisco and elsewhere exactly as it handles other power which it generates, buys or owns. Consumers of the power are billed by and pay the Company. The City buys Hetch-Hetchy power from the Company exactly as do other consumers. The City receives monthly payments from the Company on a fixed basis set out in the contract. The price received by the City has remained constant from 1925 to date although rates to the consumers have varied in the interim. In the event of the refusal, failure or inability of the Company to take the available output of the City’s plant in accordance with the agreement, the amount of energy which the City could have delivered is the basis of making the monthly payment, and the Company must pay for power delivered to it whether actually disposed of by resale or not. The rate paid by consumers for the Hetch-Hetchy power is not fixed by the City, as it could be under the Constitution of California,\\n  \\n   20\\n  \\n  but is fixed by the State Railroad Commission just as the price of\\n   \\n   *28\\n   \\n  all other power sold by the Pacific Gas & Electric Company in California is fixed.\\n \\n\\n  Thus, in brief, the City does not itself distribute and sell the power directly to consumers; it has not provided competition with the private power company; and it has transferred the right to sell and distribute the power to a private power company in violation of the express prohibition of § 6 of the Act.\\n \\n\\n  Terminology of consignment of power, rather than of transfer by sale, and verbal description of the power Com-' pany as the City’s agent or consignee, are not sufficient to take the actions of the parties under the contract out of § 6. Congress, in effect trustee of public lands for all the people, has by this Act sought to protect and control the disposition of a section of the public domain. The City has in fact followed a course of conduct which Congress, by § 6, has forbidden. Mere words and ingenuity of contractual expression, whatever their effect between the parties, cannot by description make permissible a course of conduct forbidden by law. When we look behind the word description of the arrangement between the City and the power Company to what was actually done, we see that the City has — contrary to the terms of § 6 — abdicated its control over the sale and ultimate distribution of Hetch-Hetchy power. There remain only the determinations whether the prohibitions of § 6 are constitutional and can be enforced in equity.\\n \\n\\n\\n   Second.\\n  \\n  The prohibitions of § 6 are challenged by the City as an unconstitutional invasion of the rights of the State of California on the ground that they attempt to regulate the manner in which electricity shall be disposed of in San Francisco. And the City therefore insists that these prohibitions must be considered only as covenants in a contract between the City and the United States. Upon this premise, the City has argued here, as it did in\\n   \\n   *29\\n   \\n  the Court of Appeals, that alleged equitable defenses render the covenants unenforceable.\\n \\n\\n  When the Raker Bill was before Congress, the City filed with the Public Lands Committee of the House a brief and argument in support of the Bill. Citing authorities, including this Court’s opinions, and legislative precedents, the City submitted to Congress that as grantee it would be bound by and as grantor Congress was empowered to impose “the conditions set forth in the Hetch-Hetchy bill.”\\n  \\n   21\\n  \\n  After passage of the Bill the City accepted the grant by formal ordinance, assented to all the conditions contained in the grant, constructed the required power and water facilities, and up to date has utilized the rights, privileges and benefits granted by Congress. Now, the City seeks to retain the benefits of the Act while attacking the constitutionality of one of its important conditions.\\n  \\n   22\\n  \\n\\n\\n  Article 4, § 3, Cl. 2 of the Constitution provides that “The Congress shall have Power to dispose of and make all heedful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory and other Property belonging to the United States.” The power over the public land thus entrusted to Congress is without limitations.\\n  \\n   23\\n  \\n  “And it is not for the courts to say how that trust shall be administered. That is for Con\\n   \\n   *30\\n   \\n  gress to determine.”\\n  \\n   24\\n  \\n  Thus, Congress may constitutionally limit the disposition of the public domain to a manner consistent with its views of public policy. And the policy to govern disposal of rights to develop hydroelectric power in such public lands may, if Congress chooses, be one designed to avoid monopoly and to bring about a wide-spread distribution of benefits. The statutory requirement that Hetch-Hetchy power be publicly distributed does not represent an exercise of a general control over public policy in a State but instead only an exercise of the complete power which Congress has over particular public property entrusted to it.\\n  \\n   25\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n   Third.\\n  \\n  Finally, on the basis of numerous objections to the District Court’s judgment, assigned as errors in the court below and pressed here, the City denies the Government’s right — upon a balancing of equities — to.relief by injunction even if the present disposition of Hetch-Hetchy power be in violation of the Act.\\n \\n\\n  However, after consideration of all these objections, we are satisfied that this case does not call for a balancing of equities or for the invocation of the generalities of judicial maxims in order to determine whether an injunction should have issued. The City is availing itself of valuable rights and privileges granted by the Government and yet persists in violating the very conditions upon which those benefits were granted. Congress provided “That the grantee [City] shall at all times comply with and observe on its part all the conditions specified in this Act, and in the event that the same are not reasonably complied, with and carried out by the grantee, upon written request of the Secretary of the Interior, it is made the duty of the Attorney General in the name of the United\\n   \\n   *31\\n   \\n  States to commence all necessary suits or proceedings in the proper court having jurisdiction thereof, for the purpose of enforcing and carrying out the provisions of this Act.” Pursuant to this legislative mandate, the present suit was instituted to enforce covenants exacted from a grantee of rights in the public domain by a Congress sympathetic with the local needs of San Francisco but also jealous of its own responsibility to dispose of such rights in a manner de'emed by it most likely to render their benefits widespread. The equitable doctrines relied on do not militate against the capacity of a court of equity as a proper forum in which to make a declared policy of Congress effective. Injunction to prohibit continued use — in violation of that policy — of property granted by the United States, and to enforce the grantee’s covenants, is both appropriate and necessary.\\n  \\n   26\\n  \\n\\n\\n  A substantial part of the City’s argument rests upon its claim that the Department of the Interior in the period from 1913 to 1937 construed § 6 to forbid no more than sale of power for resale. We are asked to accept these administrative interpretations. And in addition the City suggests that conduct of the Department, of which these interpretations were a part, is sufficient to create an estoppel against the Government. Whether the Department at any time ever did more than merely to tolerate sale and distribution of Hetch-Hetchy power by the Company as a temporary expedient is doubtful. Certain it is, however, that in 1935 the Secretary of the Interior declared the City’s disposition of the power through the Company to be a violation of § 6, demanded discontinuance of this violation without success and thereafter instigated this proceeding. We cannot accept the contention that administrative rulings — such as those here\\n   \\n   *32\\n   \\n  relied on — can thwart the plain purpose of a valid law. As to estoppel, it is enough to repeat that\\n  \\n   “ . . .\\n  \\n  the United States is neither bound nor estopped by acts of its officers or agents in entering into an arrangement or agreement to do or cause to- be done what the law does not sanction or permit.”\\n  \\n   27\\n  \\n\\n\\n  The judgment of the Circuit Court is reversed. The judgment of the District Court is affirmed and we remand the case to it.\\n \\n\\n\\n   Reversed.\\n  \\n\\n\\n  Mr. Justice McReynolds is of the opinion that the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals should be affirmed.\\n \\n\\n\\n   1\\n  \\n\\n   c. 4, 38 Stat. 242.\\n  \\n\\n\\n   2\\n  \\n\\n   The City and County of San Francisco is a municipal corporation of California and will be referred to here as the City.\\n  \\n\\n\\n   3\\n  \\n\\n   Section 9 (u) of the Act contains the following:\\n   \\n    “Provided, however,\\n   \\n   That the grantee shall at all times comply with and observe on its part all the conditions specified in this Act, and in the event that the same are not reasonably complied with and carried but by the grantee, upon written request of the Secretary of the Interior, it is made the duty of the Attorney General in the name of the United States to commence all necessary suits or proceedings in the proper court having jurisdiction thereof, for the purpose of enforcing and carrying out the provisions of this Act.” 38 Stat. 250.\\n  \\n\\n\\n   4\\n  \\n\\n   23 F.

                                                                                                \\n\\n  Me. Justice Reed\\n \\n\\n  delivered the opinion of the Court.\\n \\n\\n  This appeal involves the validity of the Public Revenue Service Tax Act of Colorado.\\n  \\n   1\\n  \\n  The act, § 5, imposes upon the services specified in the act, a percentage tax based upon the value of the services rendered or performed by any person subject to its provisions.\\n \\n\\n \\n   *44\\n   \\n  Section 5 (c) imposes a tax equivalent to two per cent of the value of services rendered by “banks, finance companies, trust companies and depositories . . .” The person rendering the services “shall be liable and responsible for the payment of the entire amount ...” § 6. He is required to remit all taxes collected and due the state from him to the treasurer less three per cent to cover the expense of the service. Under § 6 (B) persons rendering or performing the services are required “as far as practicable, [to] add the taix imposed ... to- the value of services or charges showing such tax as a separate and distinct item and when added such tax shall constitute a part of such value of service or charge, shall be a debt from the user to the person rendering or performing service until paid, and shall be recoverable at law in the same manner as other debts.” By subsection (d) the person rendering the service is forbidden to hold out directly or indirectly that he will assume or absorb the tax. By § 7 the user may recover illegally collected taxes. Where services are rendered which become a part of an article subject to a sales fax, the services are exempt and the person performing the service recovers where they are illegally assessed. § 3. By § 12, all sums paid by the user as taxes axe public money and trust funds of the State of Colorado. It is made a'misdemeanor, § 17, for any person rendering or performing services to refuse to make the returns required. The state treasurer is made administrator of the act and given authority to issue regulations. § 19. The usual separability clause is contained in the act. § 22.\\n \\n\\n  The definitions of the act appear in § 2. By its subsection (c) the term “services rendered or performed” is defined as those rendered for a valuable consideration by a person covered by the act for the ultimate user thereof.\\n \\n\\n  “The term 'user’ shall mean the person for whom or for whose benefit services are rendered or performed.”\\n   \\n   *45\\n   \\n  By subsection (e) taxpayer is defined as “any person obligated to account to the state treasurer for taxes collected or to be collected or due the state under the terms of this act.” Subsection (h) provides for a credit on future taxes of a tax paid on accounts eventually found worthless.\\n \\n\\n  Under the rules and regulations issued by the treasurer on the Public Revenue Service Tax Act, the service tax is construed as invalid as applied to so-called banking services.\\n  \\n   2\\n  \\n\\n\\n  Under rule 27, however, such service as the furnishing of safety vaults by depositories or banks is held to come within the act, and the two per cent tax applies to the charges made for this service. These regulations were approved by the judgment and decree of the trial court and that judgment was affirmed in all particulars by the Supreme Court of Colorado.\\n \\n\\n  While § 4 (a) makes it unlawful for any person to render the defined services without “first having obtained a license therefor,” the treasurer demands no license fees from a national bank. Such exception was held proper by the lower court.\\n  \\n   3\\n  \\n\\n\\n  The appellant here, the Colorado National Bank, was a national banking corporation duly organized and existing under the national banking act. The bank operated a safe-deposit service under its own name and in the building and vaults used for its other banking activities. The rentals received for the use of that portion of. its vaults utilized for safe-deposit boxes were reported to the Comptroller of the Currency as income in the bank; the fixtures employed in the business are-part of the assets of the bank and are supervised by the Comptroller of the Currency.\\n \\n\\n \\n   *46\\n   \\n  The appellee Bedford, as treasurer of the State of Colorado and administrator of the Service Tax Act, demanded payment from appellant bank of two per cent of the value of the services rendered by the bank to its safe deposit box customers. The bank refused payment and the treasurer brought this action under the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act (Colorado Stat. Anno., 1935, c. 93, §§ 78-79) for a declaration of rights to the effect that the services performed by the bank are taxable pursuant to the Service Tax Act. The bank answered claiming the state statute as applied to it was repugnant to the Constitution and laws of the United States; setting up the immunity of national banks from state taxation except as permitted by R. S. § 5219;\\n  \\n   4\\n  \\n  claiming that the safe-deposit business of national banks was authorized by Congress and therefore was part of its federally authorized business, immune from taxation whether the bank or the user of its services is the taxpayer. The bank further contended that even though it is not the taxpayer and the tax burden as such is not unlawful, the burden of collection, report- and visitation materially interfere with the performance of its national banking functions. A general demurrer to the answer was filed.\\n \\n\\n  The trial court sustained the bank. The supreme court first affirmed by an equally divided court and then on re\\n   \\n   *47\\n   \\n  hearing reversed\\n  \\n   5\\n  \\n  and remanded the case to the district court. The trial court entered a second judgment declaring as prayed by the treasurer which judgment was affirmed by the supreme court on the authority of the former decision.\\n \\n\\n  (1) This appeal is here under § 237 (a) of the Judicial Code. The treasurer makes the point that as the federal question raised was the immunity to the exaction of the bank as a federal instrumentality withdrawn from state taxation by congressional action, the determination that the tax was on a non-banking activity foreign to its federal character and on the user of the services eliminated the necessity of a decision on the federal question. As the statute was held valid after the conclusion of the Supreme Court of Colorado that the manner of state taxation of national banks must accord with R. S. § 5219 and must not interfere with federal functions,\\n  \\n   6\\n  \\n  it seems clear the federal question as to the validity of the statute as tested by the Constitution and laws of the United States was necessarily involved and decided. This gives this Court jurisdiction of the appeal.\\n  \\n   7\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n   Gully\\n  \\n  v.\\n  \\n   First National Bank,\\n  \\n\\n\\n    8\\n   \\n\\n\\n\\n  relied upon by the treasurer, dealt with the right to remove to a federal court\\n  \\n   9\\n  \\n  because the cause of action arose under the federal laws,\\n  \\n   10\\n  \\n  but the issue here is the right to appeal where a state statute is held valid against a defense of repug-nancy to the same laws.\\n  \\n   11\\n  \\n  The difference is brought out\\n   \\n   *48\\n   \\n  in the\\n  \\n   Gully\\n  \\n  case, where it is said: “If there were no federal law permitting the taxation of shares in national banks, a suit to recover such a tax would not be one arising under the Constitution of the United States, though the bank would have the aid of the Constitution when it came to its defense.”\\n  \\n   12\\n  \\n\\n\\n  (2) The genesis of the present system of national banks is the National Bank Act of June 3, 1864.\\n  \\n   13\\n  \\n  It was called “An Act to provide a National Currency, secured by a Pledge of United States Bonds and to provide for the Circulation and Redemption thereof.” From this act, correlated with the Federal Reserve Act,\\n  \\n   14\\n  \\n  there has' developed the present nationwide banking facilities. R. S. § 5153 makes these associations the depositories of public money. Though the national banks’ usefulness as an agency to provide for currency has diminished markedly, their importance as general bankers shows a constant growth.\\n  \\n   15\\n  \\n  We may assume that national banks possess only the powers conferred by Congress.\\n  \\n   16\\n  \\n  These are set out in R. S. § 5136 as frequently amended and include “all such incidental powers as shall be necessary to carry on the business of banking,” with the proviso “that in carrying on the business commonly known as the safe-\\n   \\n   *49\\n   \\n  deposit business the association shall not invest in the capital stock of a corporation organized under the law of any State to conduct a safe-deposit business in an amount in excess of 15 per centum of the capital stock of the association actually paid in and unimpaired and 15 per centum of its unimpaired surplus.”\\n  \\n   17\\n  \\n  We have recently found the authority to secure federal funds within these incidental powers, coupled with a long continued practice recognized by the Comptroller of the Currency.\\n  \\n   18\\n  \\n  The right to accept special deposits is recognized by the banking act.\\n  \\n   19\\n  \\n  These are monies and other valuables the identical deposits of which are kept, preserved and returned in kind. It differs little if at all from a safe-deposit business. The language of the proviso of § 24, just quoted, is the language suitable to impose restrictions on a recognized power, not the language that would be used in creating a new power. As the limitation on the power to invest in real estate protected in a measure customers and stockholders from risky investments,\\n  \\n   20\\n  \\n  the banks’ own investment in safety deposit facilities evidently did not seem to Congress to require the same regulation as the purchase of stock in a safe-deposit corporation. A subsidiary safe-deposit corporation would give priority to the creditors of the subsidiary over the depositors and other creditors of the bank itself. The obvious fact, known to all, is that national banks do and for many years have carried on a safe-deposit business. State banks, quite usually, are given the power to\\n   \\n   *50\\n   \\n  conduct a safe-deposit business.\\n  \\n   21\\n  \\n  We agree with the appellant bank that such a generally adopted method of safeguarding valuables must be considered a banking function authorized by Congress.\\n  \\n   22\\n  \\n\\n\\n  (3) We may assume, as did the Supreme Court of Colorado, that the tax is invalid if laid upon the bank as an instrumentality of government in the incidents referred to in the preceding section;\\n  \\n   23\\n  \\n  that its banking operations are free from state taxation except as Congress may permit;\\n  \\n   24\\n  \\n  that Congress permits the taxation only of shares and real estate;\\n  \\n   25\\n  \\n  and'that Congress may inter\\n   \\n   *51\\n   \\n  vene to protect its instrumentalities from any other tax which threatens their usefulness.\\n  \\n   26\\n  \\n\\n\\n  Congress has not legislated against taxation of the customers of national banks. This Court has approved a tax assessed upon the deposits of customers of national banks.\\n  \\n   27\\n  \\n  By § 6 of the Colorado act the “person rendering or performing services shall be liable” for the payment of the tax imposed. But as subsection (b) of that same section requires the tax paid to be added to the charges for service “as a separate and distinct item” and makes it a debt from the user of the services until paid, the tax is upon the user of the safe-deposit boxés, not upon the bank. Furthermore, as by § 2 (h) credit is given to the bank for taxes paid on accounts subsequently found worthless and the bank is in a position to require payment of box rentals and taxes in advance, there is no occasion for a bank ever to have saddled upon it any part of the tax burden.\\n \\n\\n  In\\n  \\n   National Bank\\n  \\n  v. Commonwealth\\n  \\n   28\\n  \\n  this Court determined a similar question in favor of the validity of the state tax. The case was decided in 1869. At that time the applicable federal statute\\n  \\n   29\\n  \\n  read: “Sec. 41. . . .\\n  \\n   Provided,\\n  \\n  That nothing in this act shall be construed to prevent all the shares in any of the said associations, held by any person . . . from being included in the valuation of the personal property of such person ... in the assessment of taxes imposed by or under state authority at the place where such bank is located, and not elsewhere. . . .”\\n \\n\\n  The statute of Kentucky laid a tax of fifty cents on each share. The same statute enacted: “The cashier of\\n   \\n   *52\\n   \\n  a bank, whose stock is taxed, shall, on the first day in July of each year, pay into the treasury the amount of tax due. If such tax be not paid, the cashier and his sureties shall be liable for the same, and twenty per cent, upon the amount; and the said bank or corporation shall thereby forfeit the privileges of its charter.”\\n \\n\\n  A national bank refused payment on the ground that it as a bank was not subject to state taxation. It was decided that this was a tax on shares, that the state in a .legal proceeding against the shareholder could have garnisheed the bank and that because the bank was a federal instrumentality was no reason for not requiring it to collect and pay over the money from the shareholder. A similar tax was upheld in\\n  \\n   Des Moines Bank\\n  \\n  v. Fairweather.\\n  \\n   30\\n  \\n\\n\\n  The person liable for the tax, primarily, cannot always be said to be the real taxpayer. The taxpayer is the person ultimately liable for the tax itself.\\n  \\n   31\\n  \\n  The funds which were received by the State came from the assets of the user, not from those of the federal instrumentality, the bank.\\n  \\n   32\\n  \\n  The Colorado Supreme Court holds the user is the taxpayer.\\n  \\n   33\\n  \\n  The determination of the state court as to the incidence of the tax has great weight with us and, when it follows logically the language of the act, as here, is controlling.\\n  \\n   34\\n  \\n  As the user directly furnishes the funds for the tax, not as an ultimate consumer with a transferred burden but by § 12 of the act as the responsible obligor, we conclude the tax is upon\\n   \\n   *53\\n   \\n  him, not upon the bank. The Constitution or laws of the United States do not forbid such a tax.\\n \\n\\n  (4) The tax being a permissible tax on customers of the bank, it is settled by our prior decisions that the statutory provisions requiring collection and remission of the taxes do not impose an unconstitutional burden on a federal instrumentality.\\n  \\n   35\\n  \\n  Especially is this true since the bank under the Colorado act is allowed three per cent of the tax for the financial burden put upon it by the obligation to collect.\\n \\n\\n\\n   Affirmed.\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n   1\\n  \\n\\n   Session Laws of Colorado, 1937, c. 240, p. 1144.

C. § 29:\\n  \\n\\n   “A national banking association may purchase, hold, and convey real estate for the following purposes, and for no others:\\n  \\n\\n   “First. Such as shall be necessary for its accommodation in the transaction of its business.”\\n  \\n\\n\\n   21\\n  \\n\\n   Paton’s Digest, 1926, Vol. 2, p. 2246, lists 24 states and territories which authorize their banks to conduct a safe-deposit business. For example, Maine, Act of 1923, c. 144, § 6, (V), authorizes savings banks to “own, maintain and let safe deposit boxes and vaults.” Ohio, Gen. Code (1921), § 710-109, empowers banks to let out safe-deposit boxes. California, Gen. Laws (1923), Act 652, § 30, any bank may conduct a safe-deposit department, but shall not invest more than one tenth of its capital and surplus in such safe-deposit department.\\n  \\n\\n\\n   22\\n  \\n\\n   The language of the proviso first appeared in an act to further amend the national banking laws of the Federal Reserve Act enacted February 25, 1927, 44 Stat. 1224, § 2 (b). Only immaterial verbal changes have occurred since the first adoption.\\n  \\n\\n   Referring to this proviso the House report said: “The second proviso regulates the safe-deposit business of national banks and prohibits ihem from investing an amount in excess of 15 per cent of capital and surplus in a corporation organized to conduct a safe-deposit business in connection with the bank. This is a business which is regularly carried on by national banks and the effect of this provision is also primarily regulative.” H. Rep.

        \\n*58Mr. Justice Frankfurter\\ndelivered the opinion of the Court.\\nAppellants have challenged the validity of a Virginia statute regulating the insurance of Virginia risks and have brought this suit to enjoin state officers from enforcing *59it. Its relevant provisions, copied in the margin,1 forbid contracts of insurance or surety by companies authorized to do business within that Commonwealth “except through regularly constituted and registered resident agents or agencies of such companies.” § 4222, e. 218, Acts of 1938. Such resident agents “shall be entitled to and shall receive the usual and customary commissions allowed on such contracts,” and may not share more than half of this commission with a non-resident broker. § 4226-a. Disobedience of these provisions (from which life, title and marine companies are exempted) may entail a fine or revocation of the corporate license in Virginia, or both. A district court of three judges, convened under § 266 of the Judicial Code as amended, 28 U. S. C. § 380, dismissed appellants’ bill on the basis of elaborate findings of fact and conclusions of law, set forth in an opinion by Circuit Judge Soper. 29 F. Supp. 71. From this *60decree the case comes here on appeal under § 238 of the Judicial Code as amended, 28 U. S. C. § 345.\\nThe bill was brought by foreign corporations authorized to do casualty and surety business in Virginia, and by some of their salaried employees. It is their claim that the statute deprives them of rights protected by the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution. The exact nature of these claims will appear more clearly in the setting of the illuminating findings below which may here be abbreviated.\\nThe “production” of insurance — “production” being insurance jargon for obtaining business — is, in the main, carried on by two groups, agents and brokers. Though both are paid by commission, the different.ways in which the two groups perform their functions have important practical consequences in the conduct of the insurance business, and hence in its regulation. The agent is tied to *61his company. But his ability to “produce” business depends upon the confidence of the community in him. He must therefore cultivate the good will and sense of dependence of his clients. He may finance the payment of premiums; he frequently assists in the filing and prosecution of claims; he acts as mediator between insurer and assured in the diverse situations which arise. The broker, on the other hand, is an independent middleman, not tied to a particular company. He meets more specially the needs of large customers, using their concentrated bargaining power to obtain the most favorable terms from competing companies. His activities, being largely confined to the big commercial centers, take place mostly outside Virginia.\\nA policy, whether “produced” by broker or agent, must be “serviced” — an insurance term for assistance rendered a customer in minimizing his risks. To this end the companies exert themselves directly, but the “producer” may render additional service. Only to a limited extent can risks be minimized at long range; local activity is essential. When the contract is “produced” by a non-resident broker the “servicing” function is normally performed by the company exclusively. When the “producer” is a resident agent, the case is ordinarily otherwise. For this, as well as for other reasons, it is obvious that non-resident brokers prefer to negotiate their contracts covering Virginia risks with companies authorized to do business in that Commonwealth.\\nThese basic elements in the insurance business attain special significance in the case of enterprises operating not only in Virginia but in other states as well. For them the brokerage system offers the attractions of large-scale production. Through what is known as a master or “hotchpotch” policy, the assured may obtain a cheaper rate by pooling all his risks, whether in or out of Virginia. This wholesale insurance may furnish not only a reduced rate *62but a reduced commission to the customer. These are advantages which naturally draw the Virginia business of interstate enterprises away from local agents in Virginia to the great insurance centers.\\nIn affecting the cost of these master policies, say the appellants, Virginia is intruding upon business transactions beyond its borders. Not only is a licensed company forbidden to write insurance except through a resident agent, but the agent cannot retain less than one-half of the customary commission allowed on such a contract for what may, so far as the requirements of the law are concerned, be no> more than the perfunctory service of countersigning the policy.\\nBut the question is not whether what Virginia has done will restrict appellants’ freedom of action outside Virginia by subjecting the exercise of such freedom to financial burde/ns. The mere fact that state action may have repercussions beyond state lines is of no judicial significance so long as the action is not within that domain which the Constitution forbids. Alaska Packers Assn. v. Comm’n, 294 U. S. 532; Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. v. Grosjean, 301 U. S. 412. Compare Equitable Life Society v. Pennsylvania, 238 U. S. 143. It is equally immaterial that such state action may run counter to the economic wisdom either of Adam Smith or of J. Maynard Keynes, or may be ultimately mischievous even from the point of view of avowed state policy. Our inquiry must be much narrower. It is whether Virginia has taken hold of a matter within her power, or has reached beyond her borders to regulate a subject which was none of her concern because the Constitution has placed control elsewhere. Compare Wallace v. Hines, 253 U. S. 66, 69.\\nVirginia has not sought to prohibit the making of contracts beyond her borders. She merely claims that her interest in the risks which these contracts are designed to prevent warrants the kind of control she has here *63imposed. This legislation is not to be judged by abstracting an isolated contract written in New York from the organic whole of the insurance business, the effect of that business on Virginia, and Virginia’s regulation of it.\\nA network of legislation controls the surety and casualty business in Virginia. Insolvent companies may not engage in it. Virginia Code, § 4180. Neither companies nor agents may give rebates. § 4222-c. Rates for workmen’s compensation, automobile liability and surety contracts are determined by its Corporation Commission. §§ 1887 (75), 4326-ar-l, 4350-3. The difficulty of enforcing these regulations, so the District Court found, may be increased if policies covering Virginia risks are “produced” without participation by responsible local agents. Rebates evading local restriction may be granted under' cover of business done outside the state. Contrariwise, if resident Virginia agents are made necessary conduits for insurance on Virginia risks now included in master policies, the state may have better means of acquiring accurate information for the effectuation of measures which it deems protective of its interests.2\\n*64It is claimed that the requirement that not less than one-half of the customary commission be retained by the resident agent is a bald exaction for what may be no more than the perfunctory service of countersigning policies. The short answer to this is that the state may rely on this exaction as a mode of assuring the active use of resident agents for procuring and “servicing” policies covering Virginia risks. These functions, when adequately performed, benefit not only the company, the producer, and the assured. By minimizing the risks of casualty and loss, they redound in a pervasive way to the benefit of the community.3 At least Virginia may so have believed. And she may also have concluded that an agency system, such as this legislation was designed to promote, is better calculated to further these desirable ends than other modes of “production.” 4 When *65these beliefs are emphasized by legislation embodying similar notions of policy in a dozen states,5 it would savor of intolerance for us to suggest that a legislature could not constitutionally entertain the views which the legislation adopts. Compare Prudential Ins. Co. v. Cheek, 259 U. S. 530, 537.\\nThe present case, therefore, is wholly unlike those instances in which a “so-called right is used as part of a scheme to accomplish a forbidden result.” Fidelity & Deposit Co. v. Tafoya, 270 U. S. 426, 434. For it is clear that Virginia has a definable interest in the contracts she seeks to regulate and that what she has done is very different from the imposition of conditions upon appellants’ privilege of engaging in local business which would bring within the orbit of state power matters unrelated to any local interests. It is not our province to measure the social advantage to Virginia of regulating the conduct of insurance companies within her borders insofar as it affects Virginia risks. Government has always had a special relation to insurance. The ways of safeguarding against the untoward manifestations of nature and other vicissitudes of life have long been withdrawn from the benefits and caprices of free competition.6 The state may fix insurance rates, German Alliance Ins. Co. v. Lewis, 233 U. S. 389; it may regulate the compensation of agents, *66O’Gorman & Young v. Hartford Fire Ins. Co., 282 U. S. 251; it may curtail drastically the area of free contract, National Ins. Co. v. Wanberg, 260 U. S. 71. States have controlled the expenses of insurance companies, New York Insurance Law, Consolidated Laws of New York, c. 28, § 244, and Wisconsin Statutes, § 201.21; and see Report of Joint (Armstrong) Insurance Investigation Committee (N. Y.) pp. 403-18 (1906). They have also promoted insurance through savings banks; see Berman, The Massachusetts System of Savings Bank Life Insurance, Bulletin No. 615, IT. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, and New York Laws of 1938, c. 471. In the light of all these exertions of state power it does not seem possible to doubt that the state could, if it chose, go into the insurance business, just as it can operate warehouses, flour mills, and other business ventures, Green v. Frazier, 253 U. S. 233, or might take “the whole business of banking under its control,” Noble State Bank v. Haskell, 219 U. S. 104, 113. If the state, as to local risks, could thus preempt the field of insurance for itself, it may stay its intervention short of such a drastic step' by insisting that its own residents shall have a share in devising and safeguarding protection against its local hazards. La Tourette v. McMaster, 248 U. S. 465. All these are questions of policy not for us to judge. For it can never be emphasized too much that one’s own opinion as to the wisdom of a law must be wholly excluded when one is doing one’s judicial duty. The limit of our inquiry is reached when we conclude that Virginia has exerted its powers as to matters within the bounds of her control.\\nIn reaching this conclusion we have been duly mindful of the cases urged upon us by appellants. In Allgeyer v. Louisiana, 165 U. S. 578, apart from the doubts that have been cast upon the opinion in that case, the state attempted to penalize the making of contracts by its residents outside its borders with companies which had never subjected themselves to local control. Thus the statute *67was thought to be directed not at the regulation of insurance within the state, but at the making of contracts without. This was followed in St. Louis Compress Co. v. Arkansas, 260 U. S. 346; but see the refined distinctions drawn in Compañia de Tabacos v. Collector, 275 U. S. 87. In Fidelity & Deposit Co. v. Tafoya, supra, the Court found that New Mexico had exceeded its power by forbidding “the payment of any emolument of any nature to any [non-resident] for the obtaining, placing or writing of any policy covering risks in New Mexico.” The Court was of opinion that this statute went “beyond any legitimate interest of the State, . . .” ibid. at 435, but carefully withheld its judgment as to the validity of a later New Mexico statute not unlike the Virginia law here under review.7\\nThe decree must be\\n\\nAffirmed.\\n\\n\\n The relevant portions of the Virginia statute are as follows: “Section 4222. ... (a) Insurance companies, legally authorized to do business in this State, except life, title and ocean marine insurance companies, shall not make contracts of insurance or surety on persons or property herein, except through regularly constituted and registered resident agents or agencies of such companies; no contract of insurance or surety covering persons or property in this State, except contracts of life, title and ocean marine insurance and except temporary binders covering other forms of insurance shall be written, issued or delivered by any such authorized insurance company, or any of its representatives, unless such contract is duly countersigned in writing by a resident agent or agency of such company; provided, however, that the countersignature of an insurance agency shall not be considered valid unless such countersignature be attested to in writing by a regularly constituted and registered resident agent of such company.\\n“No State agent, special agent, company representative, salaried officer, manager or other salaried representative of any legally authorized insurance company, except a mutual insurance company, shall countersign any contract of insurance or surety, or any renewal thereof, covering persons or property in this State, except contracts of life, title and ocean marine insurance; provided that this section *60shall not apply to railroad companies and other common carriers engaged in interstate commerce.\\n“Section 4226-a. ... No resident agent or agency may write, countersign, issue or deliver any contract of insurance or surety upon persons or property in this State unless there shall be collected at the time the contract is written, issued or delivered, or within a reasonable time thereafter, the full premium on such contract, and the resident agent or agency shall be entitled to and shall receive the usual and customary- commissions allowed on such contracts, provided that such resident agent or agency may write such contracts at the request only of such other resident agents or agencies, when such agent or agencies are properly licensed to transact the class of business involved in such exchange, and licensed non-resident insurance brokers who may be authorized by law to broker such contracts, and on exchange of business between resident agents or agencies in Virginia and licensed non-resident insurance brokers in other states the resident agent or agency in Virginia may allow or pay to such licensed non-resident insurance brokers, a commission not exceeding fifty per centum of the resident agent’s or agency’s commission allowed on such business.”\\n\\n\\n Where out-of-state “production” actually leads to rebating in defiance of § 4222-c, there would seem little'doubt of a substantial basis for Virginia's contention that the requirement of participation by a resident agent will make the illegal practices more susceptible of detection and control. Cf. La Tourette v. McMaster, 248 U. S. 465. Virginia has also contended that the master policy makes it possible for the companies to reduce their rates below the requirements of state law, and to attribute the reductions to risks in other states with requirements less stringent than those of Virginia. Appellants strenuously contend that no law of Virginia prohibits the reduction of rates for out-of-state risks to compensate for the higher rates which might be required by Virginia and, therefore, there is no illegal practice in this connection which the existence of a resident agent could aid in uncovering. This argument, if met on the merits, would lead us into the particularities of Virginia's rate laws. It is enough to say that even if these practices are not illegal, Virginia *64may have a legitimate interest in discovering the extent of their prevalence in order to devise, if she so chooses, effective laws to prevent them.\\n\\n\\n See Hardy, Risk and Risk-Bearing, pp. 9-28, 66-67; Kulp, Casualty Insurance, pp. 188-91, 467-68; Michelbacher, Casualty Insurance Principles, pp. 448-78, 583-84; Crobaugh and Redding, Casualty Insurance, pp. 17-20; Huebner, Foreword to Modern Insurance Tendencies, 157 Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, pp. 3-4; Burns, Service of Casualty Insurance, 15th Annual Meeting, Chamber of Commerce of the United States, p. 4.\\n\\n\\n “The broker is not required to render any technical service beyond the placing of business.” Michelbacher, Casualty Insurance Principles, p. 403.

But even if the broker does “service” the contract, his activities will take place in Virginia, and will affect the welfare of those inside Virginia who may be subject to the incidence of those risks which the “servicing” function tends to reduce. If this be true, it is Virginia’s concern and not ours to prefer the agency to the brokerage method of “production.”\\n\\n\\n Alabama Code, § 8379; Kansas, General Statute (Supp.), c. 40, § 246; Louisiana, Acts of 1918, No. 153; Maryland, Annotated Code, Art. 48A, § 65; Mississippi, Code, § 5205; Montana, Laws of 1937, c. 95; Oklahoma, Statutes Ann., Title 36, §§ 126, 142, 249; South Carolina, Code, § 7972; South Dakota, Code, § 31.2218; Washington, Rev.

Delta Co., 292 U. S. 143, resting on Home Ins. Co. v. Dick, 281 U. S. 397, held that the terms of a contract validly made in Tennessee could not be subsequently enlarged by Mississippi as to a condition of “substantial importance” when suit was later brought on the policy in Mississippi, simply because “the interest insured was in Mississippi when the obligation to indemnify . . . matured, and it was . . . [the company’s] duty to make payment there.” 292 U. S. at 149. At the time the contract was entered into Mississippi had no interest in the risk covered. The Court felt that, even at the time of suit, “performance at most involved only the casual payment of money in Mississippi,” ibid, at 150, and that was an interest so subordinate to that of Tennessee that the latter was entitled to have the right of way. No question was thus involved touching the right of a state to regulate companies doing business within its borders as to contracts of insurance covering local risks.\\n\\n   \n",

decision in this case. I think it sanctions an exertion of power by Virginia over transactions beyond her jurisdiction.\\n*68Virginia may, of course, regulate the making of contracts of insurance within her borders. She may require such contracts to embody specified provisions. She may regulate the enforcement of these contracts in her courts. She may supervise and condition the activities of registered foreign insurance companies, agents or brokers within the Commonwealth. The statute in question has no such purpose.\\nThe purpose and effect of the statute are to compel an insurance company which is a citizen of another state, and which negotiates a contract of insurance with an agent or broker within such other state, to pay a resident of Virginia for a service not rendered by him, but rendered by another in another state. By force of the statute a Virginia agent must countersign a contract negotiated outside of Virginia with an assured whose residence is outside of Virginia, which contract of insurance was negotiated by an agent or broker living outside of Virginia. The countersigning Virginia agent must be paid one-half the usual commission, even though the broker or agent who produced the business is licensed as a non-resident broker by Virginia, although the only service such Virginia agent is required to render and, in many cases all he does render, is the mere countersignature of the policy. With respect to this situation the court below said:\\n■ “We do not overlook the peculiar situation of the nonresident assured who form no part of the Virginia public which the state desires to protect. Undoubtedly their business methods will be disturbed by the enforcement of the statute. It is contended, not without merit, that they have no need for the services of the resident commission agents, and that in fact, the latter cannot assume the function of producing agents in their behalf without harmfully intruding themselves into confidential business affairs. Moreover, it is fair to say that these affairs are so important and so widespread in their scope as to be *69beyond the technical knowledge and skill of the average Virginia agent, and that the interests of the non-resident assureds can be best looked after by the brokers at the great centers of population where the head offices of the insurance companies and of the assureds are located, and in Virginia by the engineering and claim personnel of the companies. It is also true that the substantial compensation required by the statute to be paid to the Virginia agents will increase the cost of the business.”\\nThe plain effort of Virginia is to compel a nonresident to pay a resident of Virginia for services which the latter does not in fact render and is not required to render. The principles underlying former decisions of this court are at war with the existence of any such asserted power.1\\nThe Chief Justice and MR. Justice McReynolds join in this opinion.\\n\\n Allgeyer v. Louisiana, 165 U. S. 578; New York Life Ins. Co. v. Head, 234 U. S. 149; Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Dunken, 266 U.

regulations embodied in a municipal ordinance abridge the freedom of speech or of the press secured against state invasion by the Fourteenth Amendment.\\n  \\n   1\\n  \\n\\n\\n  Section 2 of an ordinance of Shasta County, California, provides:\\n \\n\\n  “It shall be unlawful for any person, in or upon any public street, highway, sidewalk, alley or other public place in the County of Shasta, State of California, to loiter in front of, or in the vicinity of, or to picket in front of, or in the vicinity of, or to carry, show or display any banner, transparency, badge or sign in front of, or in the vicinity of, any works, or factory, or any place of business or employment, for the purpose of inducing or influencing, or attempting to induce or influence, any person to refrain from entering any such works, or factory, or place of business, or employment, or for the purpose of inducing or influencing, or attempting to induce or influence, any person to refrain from purchasing or using any goods, wares, merchandise, or other articles, manufactured, made or kept for sale therein, or for the purpose of inducing or influencing, or attempting to induce or influence, any person to refrain from doing or performing any service or labor in any works, factory, place of business or employment, or for the purpose of intimidating, threatening or coercing, or attempting to intimidate, threaten or coerce any person who is performing, seeking or obtaining service or labor in any such works, factory, place of business or employment.”\\n  \\n   2\\n  \\n\\n\\n \\n   *110\\n   \\n  Appellant was one of a group of twenty-nme men engaged in “picketing” on U. S. Highway 99 in front of the Delta Tunnel Project in Shasta County. “The picketing consisted of walking [on the edge of the highway nearest the project] a distance of 50 to 100 feet in a general northerly direction, then turning around and retracing steps and continuing as before ... all of the walking in connection with the picketing . . . was done off the paved portion of the highway and on the gravelled portion of the right-of-way, that is, on public property.” Some of the pickets carried signs, similar to those described in the margin,\\n  \\n   3\\n  \\n  in such a manner that workers on the project and persons going along the highway in either direction could read them. The sign carried by appellant bore the legend: “This job is unfair to CIO.” These activities occurred between the hours of 7:30 and 9:00 a. m. During this period vehicles and persons passed freely without any molestation or interference through the picket line from the highway to the project and from the project to the highway, and the traffic of persons and automobiles along the highway was not obstructed. Appellant did not threaten or intimidate or coerce anyone, did not make any loud noises at any time, and was peaceful and orderly in his demeanor. The\\n   \\n   *111\\n   \\n  pickets committed no acts of violence, and there was no breach of the peace.\\n \\n\\n  The county officers arrested appellant and charged that he did “loiter, picket, and display signs and banners in a public place and in and upon a public highway in front of, and in the vicinity of the Delta Tunnel Project . . . for the purpose of inducing and influencing persons to refrain from doing and performing services and labor” at the project in violation of the ordinance. The Justice’s Court of Township Number Nine found him “guilty of violating the Shasta County Anti-Picketing Law,” rendered judgment accordingly, and imposed sentence. The Superior Court of Shasta County affirmed the judgment. That court upheld the ordinance, over appellant’s claim of unconstitutionality, on the authority of a prior decision.\\n  \\n   4\\n  \\n  The case comes here on appeal.\\n  \\n   5\\n  \\n\\n\\n  Our decision in\\n  \\n   Thornhill\\n  \\n  v.\\n  \\n   Alabama, ante,\\n  \\n  p. 88, goes far toward settling the issues presented here. Under that decision, § 2 of the ordinance in question is to be judged upon its face.\\n  \\n   6\\n  \\n\\n\\n  Section 2 on its face declares it unlawful for any person to carry or display any sign or banner or badge in the vicinity of any place of business for the purpose of inducing or attempting to induce any person to refrain from purchasing merchandise or performing services or labor. It likewise makes it unlawful for any person to loiter or\\n   \\n   *112\\n   \\n  picket in the vicinity of any place of business for a similar purpose. The terms \"loiter” and “picket” are not defined either in the ordinance or in authoritative state decisions. Therefore, they must be judged as covering all the activities embraced by the prohibition against the carrying of signs in the vicinity of a labor dispute for the purpose mentioned.\\n  \\n   7\\n  \\n  The ordinance does not proscribe the carrying of signs in other places or for the purpose of inducing or attempting to induce others to adopt courses of action not related to labor disputes. It contains no exceptions with respect to the truthfulness and restraint of the information conveyed or the number of persons engaged in the activity. It is true that the ordinance requires proof of a purpose to persuade others not to buy merchandise or perform services. Such a purpose could be found in the case of nearly every person engaged in publicizing the facts of a labor dispute; every employee or member of a union who engaged in such activity in the vicinity of a place of business could be found desirous of accomplishing such objectives; disinterested persons (who might be hired to carry signs) appear to be a possible, but unlikely, exception.\\n  \\n   8\\n  \\n  In brief, the ordinance does not regulate all carrying of signs, but, on the contrary, proscribes the carrying of signs only if by persons directly interested who approach the vicinity of a labor dispute to convey information about the dispute.\\n \\n\\n  The sweeping and inexact terms of the ordinance disclose the threat to freedom of speech inherent in its existence. It cannot be thought to differ in any material respect from the statute held void in\\n  \\n   Thornhill’s\\n  \\n  case. The carrying of signs and banners, no less than the raising of a flag, is a natural and appropriate means of convey\\n   \\n   *113\\n   \\n  ing information on matters of public concern.\\n  \\n   Stromberg\\n  \\n  v.\\n  \\n   California,\\n  \\n  283 U. S. 359. For the reasons set forth in our opinion in\\n  \\n   Thornhill\\n  \\n  v.\\n  \\n   Alabama, supra,\\n  \\n  publicizing the facts of a labor dispute in a peaceful way through appropriate means, whether by pamphlet, by word of mouth or by banner, must now be regarded as within that liberty of communication which is secured to every person by the Fourteenth Amendment against abridgment by a State.\\n \\n\\n  The power and duty of the State to take adequate steps to preserve the peace and protect the privacy, the lives, and the property of its residents cannot be doubted. But the ordinance in question here abridges liberty of discussion under circumstances presenting no clear and present danger of substantive evils within the allowable area of state control.\\n \\n\\n\\n   Reversed.\\n  \\n\\n\\n  Me. Justice McReynolds is of opinion that the judgment below should be affirmed.\\n \\n\\n\\n   1\\n  \\n\\n   “It is also well settled that municipal ordinances adopted under state authority constitute state action and are within the prohibition of the amendment.”\\n   \\n    Lovell\\n   \\n   v.\\n   \\n    Griffin,\\n   \\n   303 U. S. 444, 450;\\n   \\n    Schneider\\n   \\n   v.\\n   \\n    State,\\n   \\n   308 U. S. 147.\\n  \\n\\n\\n   2\\n  \\n\\n   Section 1 declares that it shall be unlawful for any person “to make any loud or unusual noise, or to speak in a loud or unusual\\n    \\n    *110\\n    \\n   tone, or to cry out or proclaim, for the purposes of inducing or influencing, or attempting to induce or influence, any person” to refrain from entering, or purchasing merchandise from, or performing any service in, any place of business. The State did not charge that this section was violated.\\n  \\n\\n\\n   3\\n  \\n\\n   Four signs were admitted in evidence as typical. They were of white card board, approximately 14 x 22 inches in size, and were tacked upon a stick some 34 inches long, 1% inches wide and\\n   \\n    %\\n   \\n   inch thick. Black painted letters, ranging in' size from\\n   \\n    iy2\\n   \\n   inches to 5 inches in height, spelled out one of the following legends on each sign: “Don’t be a scab,” “Shasta Tunnel and Construction Workers Local #260,” “CIO Picket Line,” “This job unfair to CIO.”\\n  \\n\\n\\n   4\\n  \\n\\n   Appellant, prior to trial, moved to dismiss the complaint upon a number of grounds, among which was the contention that § 2 of the ordinance violated the Fourteenth Amendment in abridging his “freedom of speech, freedom of press, and freedom of assembly.” The same objections were raised by demurrer, by further motions to dismiss the complaint, and by motion in arrest of judgment.\\n  \\n\\n\\n   5\\n  \\n\\n   There is no further appeal allowed in the state courts.\\n  \\n\\n\\n   6\\n  \\n\\n   We do not decide whether, in view of the separability provision (§ 3), the state courts might cull out from § 2 particular clauses which, standing alone, could be sustained.\\n  \\n\\n\\n   7\\n  \\n\\n   See\\n   \\n    Thornhill\\n   \\n   v.\\n   \\n    Alabama, ante,\\n   \\n   p. 101, n. 18.\\n  \\n\\n\\n   8\\n  \\n\\n   Even they would be covered under a construction malting purpose synonymous with intent.

McCracken argued the cause for petitioners. With him on the brief was John B. Leake.\\nMyron C. Baum argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief were Solicitor General Rankin, Assistant Attorney General Rice and Harry Baum.\\nMR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN delivered the opinion of the Court.\\nThe question before the Court is whether the proceeds of certain insurance policies on the life of the decedent, payable to named beneficiaries and irrevocably assigned by the insured, should be included in the estate of the decedent for the purposes of the federal estate tax. The facts are not in dispute. In 1934 decedent, then aged 76, purchased a series of annuity-life insurance policy combinations. Three single-premium life insurance policies, at face values of $200,000, $100,000, and $50,000, respectively, were obtained without the requirement of a medical examination. As a condition to selling decedent each life insurance policy, the companies involved required decedent also to purchase a separate, single-premium, nonrefundable life annuity policy. The premiums for each life insurance policy and for each annuity policy were fixed at regular rates. The size of each annuity, however, was calculated so that in the event the annuitant-insured died prematurely the annuity premium, less the amount allocated to annuity payments already made, would combine with the companion life insurance premium, plus interest, to equal the amount of insurance proceeds to be paid.[1] Each annuity policy could have *276 been purchased without the insurance policy for the same premium charged for it under the annuity-life insurance combination.\\nThe decedent's children were primary beneficiaries of the insurance policies; the Fidelity-Philadelphia Trust Company, as trustee of a trust established by decedent, was named beneficiary of the interests of any of decedent's children who predeceased her. In the year of purchase, decedent assigned all rights and benefits under two of the life insurance policies to her children and under the other to the Fidelity-Philadelphia Trust Company as trustee. These rights and benefits included the rights to receive dividends, to change the beneficiaries, to surrender the policies, and to assign them. Dividends were received, but, as far as the record discloses, none of the other rights was exercised. A gift tax on these transfers was paid by the decedent in 1935. In 1938 decedent amended the above-mentioned trust so that it became irrevocable. As the Government concedes, the decedent retained no beneficial or reversionary interest in the trust.\\nThe insured died in 1946. The proceeds of the three insurance policies were not included in her estate in the estate tax return. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue determined that these proceeds should have been included and assessed a deficiency accordingly. The adjusted tax was paid by the executors, and when claim for refund was denied, this action for refund followed. The District Court entered judgment for the taxpayers, but the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed. 241 F.2d 690. We granted certiorari.[2] 354 U.S. 921.\\n*277 It is conceded by the parties that the question of whether the proceeds should be included in the estate is not determinable by the federal estate tax provision dealing with life insurance proceeds. Cf. Helvering v. Le Gierse, 312 U.S. 531. To support the decision below, the Government argues that the proceeds are includible in the estate under Section 811 (c) (1) (B) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, which includes, in the estate of the decedent, property, to the extent of the decedent's interest therein, which the decedent had transferred without adequate and full consideration, under which transfer the decedent\\n\"has retained for his life . . .(i) the possession or enjoyment of, or the right to income from, the property . . . .\"\\nThe Government contends that the annuity payments, which were retained until death, were income from property transferred by the decedent to her children through the use of the life insurance policies.\\nOn the other hand, petitioners, executors of the estate, assert that the annuity payments were income from the annuity policies, which were separate property from the insurance policies, and that since decedent had assigned away the life insurance policies before death, she retained no interest in them at death.\\nThe Government relies on Helvering v. Le Gierse, supra, where this Court also had before it the issue of the taxability of proceeds from a life insurance policy in an annuity-life insurance combination. After holding that the taxability of these proceeds was not to be determined for estate tax purposes according to the statutory provisions dealing with life insurance,[3] the Court held that *278 the proceeds were includible in the estate under Section 302 (c) of the Revenue Act of 1926 because they devolved on the beneficiaries in a transfer which took \"effect in possession or enjoyment at or after . . . death.\" 312 U.S., at 542. However, in reaching this conclusion the decision did not consider the problem in the case at bar, for in Le Gierse the insured had retained the rights and benefits of the insurance policy until death. The facts in the instant case on this point are fundamentally different. Prior to death, the decedent had divested herself of all interests in the insurance policies, including the possibility that the funds would return to her or her estate if the beneficiaries predeceased her.[4] The assignees became the \"owners\" of the policies before her death; they had received the right to the immediate and unlimited use of the policies to the full extent of their worth. The immediate value of the policies was always substantial. In the year of assignment their total cash surrender value was over $289,000; in the year of death it was over $326,000. Under the assignment, the decedent had not *279 become a life tenant who postpones the possession and enjoyment of the property by the remaindermen until her death.[5] Cf. Helvering v. Bullard, 303 U.S. 297; Commissioner v. Estate of Church, 335 U.S. 632. On the contrary, the assignees held the bundle of rights, the incidents of ownership, over property from which the decedent had totally divorced herself. Cf. Chase National Bank v. United States, 278 U.S. 327; Goldstone v. United States, 325 U.S. 687.\\nIllustrative of the distinction between Helvering v. Le Gierse and the case at bar is the fact that the Government has not endeavored here to sustain the tax under the statutory provision applied in that case. Instead of the provision taxing transfers \"intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after\" the transferor's death,[6] the provision applied in Le Gierse, the Government relies on the provision taxing transfers in which the transferor has retained until death \"the right to income from\" the transferred property.[7] However, the Government's position that the annuities were income from property *280 which the insured transferred to her children under the life insurance policies is not well taken.\\nTo establish its contention, the Government must aggregate the premiums of the annuity policies with those of the life insurance policies and establish that the annuity payments were derived as income from the entire investment. This proposition cannot be established. Admittedly, when the policies were purchased, each life insurance-annuity combination was the product of a single, integrated transaction. However, the parties neither intended that, nor acted as if, any of the transactions would have a quality of indivisibility. Regardless of the considerations prompting the insurance companies to hedge their life insurance contracts with annuities, each time an annuity-life insurance combination was written, two items of property, an annuity policy and an insurance policy, were transferred to the purchaser. The annuity policy could have been acquired separately, and the life insurance policy could have been, and was, conveyed separately. The annuities arose from personal obligations of the insurance companies which were in no way conditioned on the continued existence of the life insurance contracts. These periodic payments would have continued unimpaired and without diminution in size throughout the life of the insured even if the life insurance policies had been extinguished.[8] Quite clearly the *281 annuity payments arose solely from the annuity policies. The use and enjoyment of the annuity policies were entirely independent of the life insurance policies. Because of this independence, the Commissioner may not, by aggregating the two types of policies into one investment, conclude that by receiving the annuities, the decedent had retained income from the life insurance contracts.[9]\\nAccordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is\\nReversed.\\nMR. JUSTICE BURTON, with whom MR. JUSTICE BLACK and MR. JUSTICE CLARK join, dissenting.\\nFor the reasons stated by the court below, 241 F.2d 690, and also in Conway v. Glenn, 193 F.2d 965, and Burr v. Commissioner, 156 F.2d 871, it seems to me that, for federal estate tax purposes, this case is indistinguishable from one in which a settlor places a sum in trust under such terms that he shall receive the income from it for life, and the principal shall be payable to designated beneficiaries upon his death. As the principal, in that event, would be includable in the settlor's estate for federal estate tax purposes, so here the proceeds of the insurance policies should be included in this decedent's estate. Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.\\nNOTES\\n[1]  Of course, an additional amount is added to the premiums to compensate the insurance companies for expenses.\\n[2]  In agreement with the decision below are Burr v. Commissioner, 156 F.2d 871 (C. A. 2d Cir.), and Conway v. Glenn, 193 F.2d 965 (C. A. 6th Cir.). To the contrary is Bohnen v. Harrison, 199 F.2d 492 (C. A. 7th Cir.), affirmed by an equally divided Court, 345 U.S. 946.\\n[3]  Section 302 (g) of the Revenue Act of 1926, 44 Stat. 9, 71, exempted from the estate proceeds up to $40,000 \"receivable . . . as insurance\" by persons other than the executor. The proceeds in Helvering v. Le Gierse were not considered to have arisen from \"insurance\" as Congress meant the word to be used because the ordinary \"insurance risk\" was not present. The insurance company had not undertaken to shift the risk of premature death from the insured and to distribute the risk among its other policyholders. On the contrary, by requiring a concurrent purchase of a nonrefundable annuity contract, the company had neutralized the risk at the expense of the \"insured.\" The remaining risk, whether the annuitant would live beyond the actuarial prediction and after the insurance policy had been surrendered, was considered not an insurance risk but a risk of ordinary investment. Cf. Meisenholder, Taxation of Annuity Contracts under Estate and Inheritance Taxes, 39 Mich. L. Rev. 856, 883.\\n\\nThe principle that the proceeds are not considered \"receivable. . . as insurance\" applies whether at death the rights and benefits of the policies are in the hands of the insured or of another person. Goldstone v. United States, 325 U.S. 687, 690.\\n[4]  Cf. Goldstone v. United States, supra.\\n[5]  Nor are the assignees like second annuitants in survivorship annuities or joint annuitants in joint and survivor annuities. The donor's and donee's annuities have a common fund as the source so that if the source of the donor's annuity is extinguished, the donee's annuity is destroyed. The entire economic enjoyment of the second annuitant must, realistically speaking, await the death of the first annuitant, and a substantial portion of the surviving joint annuitant's enjoyment is similarly postponed. Cf., e. g., Commissioner v. Wilder's Estate, 118 F.2d 281; Commissioner v. Clise, 122 F.2d 998; Mearkle's Estate v. Commissioner, 129 F.2d 386.\\n[6]  Section 811 (c) (1) (C) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, as amended by Section 7 (a) of the Act of October 25, 1949, c. 720, 63 Stat. 891, 895.\\n[7]  Section 811 (c) (1) (B) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, as amended by Section 7 (a) of the Act of October 25, 1949, c. 720, 63 Stat. 894. This provision was also a part of Section 302 (c) of the Revenue Act of 1926 at the time applicable in Helvering v. Le Gierse.\\n[8]  Where a decedent, not in contemplation of death, has transferred property to another in return for a promise to make periodic payments to the transferor for his lifetime, it has been held that these payments are not income from the transferred property so as to include the property in the estate of the decedent. E. g., Estate of Sarah A. Bergan, 1 T.C. 543, Acq., 1943 Cum. Bull. 2; Security Trust & Savings Bank, Trustee, 11 B. T. A. 833; Seymour Johnson, 10 B. T. A. 411; Hirsh v. United States, 68 Ct. Cl. 508, 35 F.2d 982 (Ct. Cl. 1929); cf. Welch v. Hall, 134 F.2d 366. In these cases the promise is a personal obligation of the transferee, the obligation is usually not chargeable to the transferred property, and the size of the payments is not determined by the size of the actual income from the transferred property at the time the payments are made.\\n[9]  For the treatment by lower courts of the life insurance-annuity combination in a similar situation in the field of federal income taxation, cf. Commissioner v. Meyer, 139 F.2d 256; Edna E. Meredith, 1 T.C. M. 847, affirmed, Helvering v. Meredith, 140 F.2d 973; John Koehrer, 4 T.C. M. 219.\\n   \n",

JUSTICE CLARK delivered the opinion of the Court.\\nPetitioners stand convicted on a single-count indictment charging a conspiracy under § 1 of the Sherman Act. They contend that the trial judge erred in refusing to permit them to inspect the grand jury minutes covering the testimony before that body of a key government witness at the trial. The Court of Appeals affirmed the convictions, 260 F.2d 397. With reference to the present claim, it held that Rule 6 (e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure[1] committed the inspection or not of grand jury minutes to the sound discretion of the trial judge, *397 and that in this instance, no abuse of that discretion had been shown. We granted certiorari limited to the question posed by this ruling. 358 U.S. 917, 918. We conclude that in the circumstances of this case the trial court did not err in refusing to make Jonas' grand jury testimony available to petitioners for use in cross-examination.\\nThe indictment returned in the case named as defendants seven corporations, all manufacturers of mirrors, and three of their officers. However, only three of the corporations are petitioners here, along with one individual, J. A. Messer, Sr. The indictment charged a conspiracy to fix the price of plain plate glass mirrors sold in interstate commerce. It is not necessary for our purposes to detail the facts of this long trial, the record of which covers 860 pages. It is sufficient to say that the Government proved its case through 10 witnesses, the last of whom was Jonas. He was President of a large North Carolina mirror manufacturing company and had a reputation for independence in the industry. Although neither he nor his corporation was indicted, the latter was made a co-conspirator. The evidence indicates that the conspiracy was consummated at two meetings held on successive days during the week of the annual meeting of the Mirror Manufacturers Association in 1954 at Asheville, North Carolina. Jonas, not being a member of the Association, did not attend the convention. Talk at the convention regarding prices culminated in telephone calls by several representatives of mirror manufacturers to Jonas concerning his attitude on raising prices. On the day following these calls Jonas and three of the participants in the conspiracy met at an inn away from the convention headquarters and discussed \"prices.\" Within three days thereafter each of the manufacturers announced an identical price increase, which was approximately 10 percent. Jonas' testimony, of course, was confined to the telephone calls and the meeting at the inn *398 where the understanding was finalized. The Government admits that he was an \"important\" witness. However, proof of the conspiracy was overwhelming aside from Jonas' testimony. While he was the only witness who characterized the outcome of the meetings as an \"agreement\" on prices, no witness negatived this conclusion and the identical price lists that followed the meeting at the inn were little less than proof positive.\\nAfter the conclusion of Jonas' testimony, defense counsel interrogated him as to the number of times he appeared and the subject of his testimony before the grand jury. Upon ascertaining that Jonas had testified three times on \"the same general subject matter,\" counsel moved for the delivery of the grand jury minutes. He stated that the petitioners had \"a right . . . to inspect the Grand Jury record of the testimony of this witness after he has completed his direct examination\" relating to \"the same general subject matter\" as his trial testimony.[2] As authority for \"the automatic delivery of Grand Jury transcripts\" under such circumstances counsel cited Jencks v. United States, 353 U.S. 657 (1957). As previously indicated, the motion was denied.\\nIt appears to us clear that Jencks v. United States, supra, is in nowise controlling here. It had nothing to do with grand jury proceedings and its language was not intended to encompass grand jury minutes. Likewise, it is equally clear that Congress intended to exclude those minutes from the operation of the so-called Jencks Act, 71 Stat. 595, 18 U.S. C. (Supp. V, 1958) § 3500.[3]\\nPetitioners concede, as they must, that any disclosure of grand jury minutes is covered by Fed. Rules Crim. Proc. 6 (e) promulgated by this Court in 1946 after the *399 approval of Congress. In fact, the federal trial courts as well as the Courts of Appeals have been nearly unanimous in regarding disclosure as committed to the discretion of the trial judge.[4] Our cases announce the same principle,[5] and Rule 6 (e) is but declaratory of it.[6] As recently as last Term we characterized cases where grand jury minutes are used \"to impeach a witness, to refresh his recollection, to test his credibility and the like\" as instances of \"particularized need where the secrecy of the proceedings is lifted discretely and limitedly.\" United States v. Procter & Gamble, 356 U.S. 677, 683 (1958).\\nPetitioners argue, however, that the trial judge's discretion under Rule 6 (e) must be exercised in accordance with the rationale of Jencks; namely, upon a showing on cross-examination that a trial witness testified before the grand juryand nothing morethe defense has a \"right\" to the delivery to it of the witness' grand jury testimony.\\nThis conclusion, however, runs counter to \"a long-established policy\" of secrecy, United States v. Procter & Gamble, supra, at 681, older than our Nation itself. The reasons therefor are manifold, id., at 682, and are compelling when viewed in the light of the history and modus operandi of the grand jury. Its establishment in the Constitution \"as the sole method for preferring charges in serious criminal cases\" indeed \"shows the high place it [holds] as an instrument of justice.\" Costello v. United States, 350 U.S. 359, 362 (1956). Ever since this action *400 by the Fathers, the American grand jury, like that of England, \"has convened as a body of laymen, free from technical rules, acting in secret, pledged to indict no one because of prejudice and to free no one because of special favor.\" Ibid. Indeed, indictments may be returned on hearsay, or for that matter, even on the knowledge of the grand jurors themselves. Id., at 362, 363. To make public any part of its proceedings would inevitably detract from its efficacy. Grand jurors would not act with that independence required of an accusatory and inquisitorial body. Moreover, not only would the participation of the jurors be curtailed, but testimony would be parsimonious if each witness knew that his testimony would soon be in the hands of the accused. Especially is this true in antitrust proceedings where fear of business reprisal might haunt both the grand juror and the witness. And this \"go slow\" sign would continue as realistically at the time of trial as theretofore.\\nIt does not follow, however, that grand jury minutes should never be made available to the defense. This Court has long held that there are occasions, see United States v. Procter & Gamble, supra, at 683, when the trial judge may in the exercise of his discretion order the minutes of a grand jury witness produced for use on his cross-examination at trial. Certainly \"disclosure is wholly proper where the ends of justice require it.\" United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., supra, at 234.\\nThe burden, however, is on the defense to show that \"a particularized need\" exists for the minutes which outweighs the policy of secrecy. We have no such showing here. As we read the record the petitioners failed to show any need whatever for the testimony of the witness Jonas. They contended only that they had a \"right\" to the transcript because it dealt with subject matter generally covered at the trial. Petitioners indicate that the trial judge required a showing of contradiction *401 between Jonas' trial and grand jury testimony. Such a preliminary showing would not, of course, be necessary. While in a colloquy with counsel the judge did refer to such a requirement, we read his denial as being based on the breadth of petitioners' claim. Petitioners also claim error because the trial judge failed to examine the transcript himself for any inconsistencies. But we need not consider that problem because petitioners made no such request of the trial judge. The Court of Appeals apparently was of the view that even if the trial judge had been requested to examine the transcript he would not have been absolutely required to do so. It is contended here that the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has reached a contrary conclusion. United States v. Spangelet, 258 F.2d 338. Be that as it may, resolution of that question must await a case where the issue is presented by the record. The short of it is that in the present case the petitioners did not invoke the discretion of the trial judge, but asserted a supposed absolute right, a right which we hold they did not have. The judgment is therefore.\\nAffirmed.\\nMR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE, MR. JUSTICE BLACK and MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS join, dissenting.\\nIn the words of the Court of Appeals, Jonas was the Government's \"principal prosecuting witness.\"[1] He was President of Lenoir Mirror Company, which company was *402 a participant in the alleged price-fixing conspiracy, but was not indicted. After Jonas testified on direct examination defense counsel asked for the production of his relevant grand jury testimony. The trial judge immediately made clear his intention not to grant the motion: \"Unless you can show some sound basis that contradicts between what happened in the Grand Jury room and his testimony before the Grand Jury and his testimony in this trial, I am not going to require the production of the Grand Jury records. It would be easy for any attorney to get access to the records of the Grand Jury by just such a motion as you are making here.\" Defense counsel protested, \"we are not attempting that. We want just a transcript of his testimony before the Grand Jury regarding the subjects to which he has testified on direct examination.\" (Emphasis supplied.) This request thus encompassed all of Jonas' grand jury testimony only if all of that testimony covered the subject matter of Jonas' trial testimony. The court replied, \"You have stated what you want to ask him and I am denying your right to do it.\" Plainly defense counsel were not asking to see the minutes of the entire grand jury proceedings, nor even of all of Jonas' testimony before the grand jury unless all of it was on the same subject matter as his trial testimony. Their motion was carefully limited to a request for so much of Jonas' grand jury testimony as \"covered the substance of his testimony on direct examination.\" This request that secrecy be \"lifted discretely and limitedly,\" United States v. Procter & Gamble, 356 U.S. 677, 683, necessarily implied a request that the trial judge inspect the grand jury minutes and turn over to the defense only those parts dealing with Jonas' testimony on the same subject matter as his trial testimony. In this posture, then, the question for our decision is the narrow one whether the trial judge erred in denying the defense request for inspection of the grand jury testimony of a *403 key government witness which covered the subject matter of that witness' trial testimony.[2] I dissent from the Court's affirmance of the trial judge's ruling denying this carefully circumscribed request.\\nGrand jury secrecy is, of course, not an end in itself. Grand jury secrecy is maintained to serve particular ends. But when secrecy will not serve those ends or when the advantages gained by secrecy are outweighed by a countervailing interest in disclosure, secrecy may and should be lifted, for to do so in such a circumstance would further the fair administration of criminal justice. See McNabb v. United States, 318 U.S. 332. It is true that secrecy is not to be lifted without a showing of good reason, but it is too late in the day to say, as the Court as a practical matter does here, that the Government may insist upon grand jury secrecy even when the possible prejudice to the accused in a criminal case is crystal clear and none of the reasons justifying secrecy is present. \"[A]fter the grand jury's functions are ended, disclosure is wholly proper where the ends of justice require it.\" United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 310 U.S. 150, 234. Thus grand jury minutes have been made available to a defendant accused of committing perjury before the grand jury so that he could adequately prepare his defense, United States v. Remington, 191 F.2d 246; United States v. Rose, 215 F.2d 617, and to a defendant who can show an inconsistency between the trial testimony and grand jury testimony of a government witness, United States v. Alper, 156 F.2d 222; Burton v. United States, 175 F.2d 960; Herzog v. United States, 226 F.2d 561; United States v. H. J. K. Theatre Corp., 236 F.2d 502. On occasion the Government itself has recognized the fairness of permitting the defense access to the grand jury testimony of *404 government witnesses even though it considered that it was not bound to do so, United States v. Grunewald, 162 F. Supp. 621. This Court has implied that grand jury minutes would be discoverable by a defendant in a civil antitrust suit instituted by the Government on a showing of \"particularized need,\" United States v. Procter & Gamble, 356 U.S. 677, 683.[3] Nor can we overlook that the Government uses grand jury minutes to further its own interests in litigation. It is apparently standard practice for government attorneys to use grand jury minutes in preparing a case for trial, see United States v. Procter & Gamble, 356 U.S. 677, 678, in refreshing the recollection of government witnesses at trial, see United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 310 U.S. 150, 233, and, when the need arises, in impeaching witnesses at trial, see United States v. Cotter, 60 F.2d 689. Of course, when the Government uses grand jury minutes at trial the defense is ordinarily entitled to inspect the relevant testimony in those minutes. United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 310 U.S. 150, 233; United States v. Cotter, 60 F.2d 689. Indeed, Rule 6 (e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal *405 Procedure itself recognizes that grand jury testimony is discoverable under appropriate circumstances.[4]\\nThe Court apparently agrees with the conclusion compelled by these precedents, for its opinion states that grand jury minutes are discoverable when \" `a particularized need' exists for the minutes which outweighs the policy of secrecy.\" But the Court pays only lip service to the principle in view of the result in this case. It is clear beyond question, I think, that the application of that principle to this case requires a holding that Jonas' grand jury testimony is discoverable to the limited extent sought. Since there are no valid considerations which militate in favor of grand jury secrecy in this case, simple justice requires that the petitioners be given access to the relevant portions of Jonas' grand jury testimony so that they have a fair opportunity to refute the Government's case.\\nEssentially four reasons have been advanced as justification for grand jury secrecy.[5] (1) To prevent the accused from escaping before he is indicted and arrested or from tampering with the witnesses against him. (2) To prevent disclosure of derogatory information presented to the grand jury against an accused who has not been indicted. (3) To encourage complainants and witnesses to come before the grand jury and speak freely without fear that their testimony will be made public thereby subjecting them to possible discomfort or retaliation. (4) To encourage the grand jurors to engage in uninhibited investigation and deliberation by barring disclosure of their votes and comments during the proceedings.\\n*406 None of these reasons dictates that Jonas' grand jury testimony, to the limited extent it is sought, should be kept secret. The Court, while making obeisance to \"a long-established policy\" of secrecy, makes no showing whatever how denial of Jonas' grand jury testimony serves any of the purposes justifying secrecy. Certainly disclosure at this stage of the proceedings would not enable the defendants to escape from custody or to tamper with the witness who has already testified against them on direct examination. Certainly, also, protection of an innocent accused who has not been indicted has no bearing on this case. Discovery has been sought only of Jonas' grand jury testimony on the same subject matter as his testimony at trial. This testimony will have condemned someone to whom he did not refer at trial only if he has concealed information at the trial, and this creates the very situation in which it is imperative that the defense have access to the grand jury testimony if we are to adhere to the standards we have set for ourselves to assure the fair administration of criminal justice in the federal courts. Similarly, disclosure of Jonas' relevant grand jury testimony could not produce the apprehended results of retaliation or discomfort which might induce a reluctance in others to testify before grand juries. Jonas has already taken the stand and testified freely in open court against the defendants. His testimony has been extremely damaging. Disclosure of his testimony before the grand jury is hardly likely to result in any embarrassment that his trial testimony has not already produced. \"If he tells the truth, and the truth is the same as he testified before the grand jury, the disclosure of the former testimony cannot possibly bring to him any harm . . . which his testimony on the open trial does not equally tend to produce.\" 8 Wigmore, Evidence (3d ed. 1940), § 2362, at 725. Witnesses before a grand jury necessarily know that once called by the Government to testify at trial they cannot *407 remain secret informants quite apart from whether their grand jury testimony is discoverable. Finally, the defense seeks nothing which would disclose the votes or opinions of any of the grand jurors involved in these proceedings. All that is sought is the relevant testimony of Jonas. If there are questions by grand jurors intertwined with Jonas' testimony disclosure of which would indicate the jurors' opinions or be embarrassing to them, the names of the grand jurors asking the questions can be excised. Cf. United States v. Grunewald, 162 F. Supp. 621.\\nPlainly, then, no reason justifying secrecy of Jonas' relevant grand jury testimony appears. The Court's insistence on secrecy exalts the principle of secrecy for secrecy's sake in the face of obvious possible prejudice to the petitioners' defense against Jonas' seriously damaging testimony on the trial. Surely \"Justice requires no less,\" Jencks v. United States, 353 U.S. 657, 669, than that the defense be permitted every reasonable opportunity to impeach a government witness, and that a criminal conviction not be based on the testimony of untruthful or inaccurate witnesses. The interest of the United States in a criminal prosecution, it must be emphasized, \"is not that it shall win a case, but that justice shall be done.\" Berger v. United States, U. S. 78, 88.\\nObviously the impeachment of the Government's key witness on the basis of prior inconsistent or contradictory statements made under oath before a grand jury would have an important effect on a trial. Thus it has long been held that a defendant may have access to inconsistent grand jury testimony for use in cross-examination if he can somehow show that an inconsistency between the trial and grand jury testimony exists. United States v. Alper, 156 F.2d 222; Burton v. United States, 175 F.2d 960; Herzog v. United States, 226 F.2d 561; United States v. H. J. K. Theatre Corp., 236 F.2d 502. But in an analogous situation we have pointed *408 out the folly of requiring the defense to show inconsistency between the witness' trial testimony and his previous statements on the same subject matter before it can obtain access to those very statements. In Jencks v. United States, 353 U.S. 657, we said that it offers no protection to permit a defendant to obtain inconsistent statements to impeach a witness unless he may inspect statements to determine if in fact they are inconsistent with the trial testimony. We said in Jencks:\\n\"Requiring the accused first to show conflict between the reports and the testimony is actually to deny the accused evidence relevant and material to his defense. The occasion for determining a conflict cannot arise until after the witness has testified, and unless he admits conflict, as in Gordon, [Gordon v. United States, 344 U.S. 414] the accused is helpless to know or discover conflict without inspecting the reports. A requirement of a showing of conflict would be clearly incompatible with our standards for the administration of criminal justice in the federal courts and must therefore be rejected.\" 353 U.S., at 667-668.\\nThe considerations which moved us to lay down this principle as to prior statements of government witnesses made to government agents obviously apply with equal force to the grand jury testimony of a government witness. For the defense will rarely be able to lay a foundation for obtaining grand jury testimony by showing it is inconsistent with trial testimony unless it can inspect the grand jury testimony, and, apparently in recognition of this fact, the Court holds today that a preliminary showing of inconsistency by the defense would not be necessary in order for it to obtain access to relevant grand jury minutes. It is suggested by the Government, however, that rather than permit the defense to inspect the *409 relevant grand jury minutes for possible use on cross-examination, the trial judge should inspect them and turn over to the defense only those portions, if any, that the judge considers would be useful for purposes of impeachment. This procedure has sometimes been utilized in the past as a way to limit discovery of grand jury minutes. See United States v. Alper, 156 F.2d 222; United States v. Consolidated Laundries, 159 F. Supp. 860. But we pointed out in Jencks the serious disadvantages of such a procedure and expressly disapproved of it. We said:\\n\"Flat contradiction between the witness' testimony and the version of the events given in his reports is not the only test of inconsistency. The omission from the reports of facts related at the trial, or a contrast in emphasis upon the same facts, even a different order of treatment, are also relevant to the cross-examining process of testing the credibility of a witness' trial testimony.\\n.....\\n\". . . We hold . . . that the petitioner is entitled to inspect the reports to decide whether to use them in his defense. Because only the defense is adequately equipped to determine the effective use for purpose of discrediting the Government's witness and thereby furthering the accused's defense, the defense must initially be entitled to see them to determine what use may be made of them. Justice requires no less.\" 353 U.S., at 667-669.\\nFrom Jonas' own admission it appears that his grand jury testimony covered the subject matter of his trial testimony. The reasons for permitting the defense counsel rather than the trial judge to decide what parts of that testimony can effectively be used on cross-examination are certainly not less compelling than in regard to the FBI reports involved in Jencks. For grand jury *410 testimony is often lengthy and involved, and it will be extremely difficult for even the most able and experienced trial judge under the pressures of conducting a trial to pick out all of the grand jury testimony that would be useful in impeaching a witness. See United States v. Spangelet, 258 F.2d 338. His task should be completed when he has satisfied himself what part of the grand jury testimony covers the subject matter of the witness' testimony on the trial, and when he has given that part to the defense. Then the defense may utilize the grand jury testimony for impeachment purposes as it may deem advisable in its best interests, subject of course to the applicable rules of evidence.\\nI would reverse the Court of Appeals and order a new trial for failure of the trial judge to order the production of Jonas' relevant grand jury testimony.\\nNOTES\\n[*]  Together with No. 491, Galax Mirror Co., Inc., et al. v. United States, also on certiorari to the same Court, argued April 29, 1959.\\n[1]  \"Rule 6. The Grand Jury.\\n\\n.....\\n\"(e) Secrecy of Proceedings and Disclosure. Disclosure of matters occurring before the grand jury other than its deliberations and the vote of any juror may be made to the attorneys for the government for use in the performance of their duties. Otherwise a juror, attorney, interpreter or stenographer may disclose matters occurring before the grand jury only when so directed by the court preliminarily to or in connection with a judicial proceeding or when permitted by the court at the request of the defendant upon a showing that grounds may exist for a motion to dismiss the indictment because of matters occurring before the grand jury. No obligation of secrecy may be imposed upon any person except in accordance with this rule. The court may direct that an indictment shall be kept secret until the defendant is in custody or has given bail, and in that event the clerk shall seal the indictment and no person shall disclose the finding of the indictment except when necessary for the issuance and execution of a warrant or summons.\"\\n[2]  The fact that the trial testimony and that before the grand jury included the same \"subjects\" or related to \"the same general subject matter\" is not contested.\\n[3]  See S.

Rules Crim. Proc.\\n[1]  Jonas was the only witness to testify that the defendants had actually agreed to a uniform price increase. Furthermore, his testimony was necessary to refute other testimony that the President of petitioner Galax Mirror Co., Inc., had stated that he would follow his pricing policy regardless of what the other manufacturers did. Jonas' testimony was also instrumental in connecting petitioner Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co. to the price-fixing agreement.\\n[2]  As the Court points out, discovery of grand jury minutes is not affected by the Jencks statute, 18 U.S. C. (Supp. V) § 3500.\\n[3]  United States v. Procter & Gamble, upon which the Court relies, actually is authority for permitting discovery in this case. The Court in that case recognized that grand jury minutes were discoverable where the need outweighed the advantages of secrecy, but held that such was not the case in the circumstances because, unlike this case, Procter & Gamble concerned a demand for a transcript of the entire grand jury proceedings to be used in pretrial preparation of a civil suit. This case, of course, concerns a demand for discovery of a particular witness' relevant testimony for use on cross-examination at trial in a criminal prosecution. The Court specifically stated in Procter & Gamble: \"We do not reach in this case problems concerning the use of the grand jury transcript at the trial to impeach a witness, to refresh his recollection, to test his credibility and the like.

*217\\n   \\n  Per Curiam.\\n \\n\\n  I\\n \\n\\n  Congress has adopted a policy that favors contracting with small businesses owned and controlled by the socially and economically disadvantaged. See § 8(d)(1) of the Small Business Act, as added by §7 of Pub. L. 87-305,75 Stat. 667, and as amended, 15 U. S. C. § 637(d)(1) (1994 ed., Supp. IV). To effectuate that policy, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA), Pub. L. 102-240, § 1003(b), 105 Stat. 1919, which is an appropriations measure for the Department of Transportation (DOT), seeks to direct 10 percent of the contracting funds expended on projects funded in whole or in part by the appropriated funds to transportation projects employing so-called disadvantaged business enterprises.\\n  \\n   1\\n  \\n  ISTEA § 1003(b)(1).\\n \\n\\n \\n   *218\\n   \\n  To qualify for that status, the small business must be certified as owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. DOT does not itself conduct certifications, but relies on certifications from two main sources: the Small Business Administration, which certifies businesses for all types of federal procurement programs, and state highway agencies, which certify them for purposes of federally assisted highway projects. The federal regulations governing these certification programs, see 13 CFR pt. 124 (1999) (Small Business Administration); 64 Fed. Reg. 5096-5148 (1999) (to be codified in 49 CFR pt. 26) (DOT for state highway agencies), require that the certifying entity\\n  \\n   presume\\n  \\n  to be socially disadvantaged persons who are black, Hispanic, Asian Pacific, Subcontinent Asian, Native Americans, or members of other groups designated from time to time by the Small Business Administration. See 13 CFR § 124.103(b); 64 Fed. Reg. 5136 (§26.67). State highway agencies must in addition presume that women are socially disadvantaged.\\n  \\n   Ibid.\\n  \\n  Small businesses owned and controlled by persons who are not members of the preferred groups may also be certified, but only if they can\\n  \\n   demonstrate\\n  \\n  social disadvantage. See 13 CFR § 124.103(c); 64 Fed. Reg. 5136-5137 (§ 26.67(d));\\n  \\n   id.,\\n  \\n  at 5147-5148 (pt. 26, subpt. D, App. E). Third parties, as well as DOT, may challenge findings of social disadvantage. See 13 CFR § 124.1017(a); 64 Fed. Reg. 5142 (§26.87).\\n \\n\\n  II\\n \\n\\n  In 1989, DOT awarded the prime contract for a federal highway project in Colorado to Mountain Gravel\\n  \\n   &\\n  \\n  Construction Company. The contract included a Subcontractor Compensation Clause — which the Small Business Act requires all\\n   \\n   *219\\n   \\n  federal agencies to include in their prime contracts, see 15 U. S. C. § 637(d) — rewarding the prime contractor for subcontracting with disadvantaged business enterprises, see § 637(d)(4)(E). Petitioner, whose principal is a white man, submitted the low bid on a portion of the project, but Mountain Gravel awarded the subcontract to a company that had previously been certified by the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) as a disadvantaged business enterprise.\\n \\n\\n  Petitioner brought suit against various federal officials, alleging that the Subcontractor Compensation Clause, and in particular the race-based presumption that forms its foundation, violated petitioner’s Fifth Amendment right to equal protection. The Tenth Circuit, applying the so-called intermediate scrutiny approved in some of our cases involving classifications on a basis other than race, see\\n  \\n   Mississippi Univ. for Women\\n  \\n  v.\\n  \\n   Hogan,\\n  \\n  458 U. S. 718 (1982);\\n  \\n   Craig\\n  \\n  v.\\n  \\n   Boren,\\n  \\n  429 U. S. 190 (1976), upheld the use of the clause and the presumption.\\n  \\n   Adarand Constructors, Inc.\\n  \\n  v.\\n  \\n   Peña,\\n  \\n  16 F. 3d 1537 (1994). Because DOT’S use of race-based measures should have been subjected to strict scrutiny, we reversed and remanded for the application of that standard.\\n  \\n   Adarand Constructors, Inc.\\n  \\n  v.\\n  \\n   Peña,\\n  \\n  515 U. S. 200, 237-239 (1995)\\n  \\n   (Adarand I).\\n  \\n\\n\\n  On remand, the District Court for the District of Colorado held that the clause and the presumption failed strict scrutiny because they were not narrowly tailored.\\n  \\n   Adarand Constructors, Inc.\\n  \\n  v.\\n  \\n   Peña,\\n  \\n  965 F. Supp. 1556 (1997)\\n  \\n   (Adarand II).\\n  \\n  Specifically, the court held the presumption that members of the enumerated racial groups are socially disadvantaged to be both overinelusive and underinclusive, because it includes members of those groups who are not disadvantaged and excludes members of other groups who are.\\n  \\n   Id.,\\n  \\n  at 1580. The District Court enjoined DOT from\\n   \\n   *220\\n   \\n  using the elause and its presumption.\\n  \\n   2\\n  \\n\\n   Id.,\\n  \\n  at 1584. Respondents appealed to the Tenth Circuit.\\n \\n\\n  Shortly thereafter, and while respondents’ appeal was still pending, petitioner filed a second suit in the District Court, this time naming as defendants certain Colorado officials, and challenging (on the same grounds) the State’s use of the federal guidelines in certifying disadvantaged business enterprises for federally assisted projects.\\n  \\n   Adarand Constructors, Inc.\\n  \\n  v.\\n  \\n   Romer,\\n  \\n  Civ. No. 97-K-1351 (June 26, 1997). Shortly after this suit was filed, however, Colorado altered its certification program in response to the District Court's decision in\\n  \\n   Adarand II.\\n  \\n  Specifically, the State did away with the presumption of social disadvantage for certain minorities and women, App. to Pet. for Cert. 109-111, and in its place substituted a requirement that all applicants certify on their own account that each of the firm’s majority owners “has experienced social disadvantage based upon the effects of racial, ethnic or gender discrimination,”\\n  \\n   id.,\\n  \\n  at 110. Colorado requires no further showing of social disadvantage by any applicant.\\n \\n\\n  A few days after Colorado amended its certification procedure, the District Court held a hearing on petitioner’s motion for a preliminary injunction in\\n  \\n   Romer.\\n  \\n  The District Court took judicial notice of its holding in\\n  \\n   Adarand II\\n  \\n  that the Federal Government had discriminated against petitioner’s owner “by the application of unconstitutional rules and regulations.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 136. As a result of that race-based discrimination, the District Court reasoned, petitioner likely was eligible for disadvantaged business status under Colorado’s system for certifying businesses for federally assisted projects — the system at issue in\\n  \\n   Romer.\\n  \\n  App. to Pet. for Cert. 137. The District Court therefore denied\\n   \\n   *221\\n   \\n  petitioner’s request for a preliminary injunction.\\n  \\n   Id.,\\n  \\n  at 138. Petitioner then requested and received disadvantaged business status from CDOT.\\n \\n\\n  Meanwhile, respondents’ appeal from the District Court’s decision in\\n  \\n   Adamnd II\\n  \\n  was pending before the Tenth Circuit. Upon learning that CDOT had given petitioner disadvantaged business status, the Tenth Circuit held that the cause of action was moot, and vacated the District Court’s judgment favorable to petitioner in\\n  \\n   Adarand II.\\n  \\n  169 F. 3d 1292, 1296-1297, 1299 (CA10 1999). Petitioner filed a petition for certiorari.\\n \\n\\n  Ill\\n \\n\\n  In dismissing the ease as moot, the Tenth Circuit relied on the language of the Subcontractor Compensation Clause, which provides that “[a] small business concern will be considered a [disadvantaged business enterprise] after it has been certified as such by . . . any State’s Department of Highways/Transportation.”\\n  \\n   Id.,\\n  \\n  at 1296. Because CDOT had certified petitioner as a disadvantaged business enterprise, the court reasoned, the language of the clause indicated that the Federal Government also had accepted petitioner’s certification for purposes of federal projects. As a result, petitioner could no longer demonstrate “ ‘an invasion of a legally protected interest’ that is sufficiently ‘concrete and particularized’ and ‘actual or imminent’” to establish standing.\\n  \\n   Arizonans for Official English\\n  \\n  v.\\n  \\n   Arizona,\\n  \\n  520 U. S. 43, 64 (1997) (quoting\\n  \\n   Lujan\\n  \\n  v.\\n  \\n   Defenders of Wildlife,\\n  \\n  504 U. S. 555, 560 (1992)). Because, the court continued, petitioner could not demonstrate such an invasion, its cause of action was\\n  \\n   moot.\\n  \\n  169 F. 3d, at 1296-1297.\\n \\n\\n  In so holding, the Tenth Circuit “confused mootness with standing,”\\n  \\n   Friends of Earth, Inc.\\n  \\n  v.\\n  \\n   Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc., ante,\\n  \\n  at 189, and as a result placed the burden of proof on the wrong party. If this case is moot, it is because the Federal Government has accepted CDOT’s\\n   \\n   *222\\n   \\n  certification of petitioner as a disadvantaged business enterprise, and has thereby eeased its offending conduct. Voluntary cessation of challenged conduct moots a ease, however, only if it is\\n  \\n   “absolutely\\n  \\n  clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur.”\\n  \\n   United States\\n  \\n  v.\\n  \\n   Concentrated Phosphate Export Assn., Inc.,\\n  \\n  393 U. S. 199, 203 (1968) (emphasis added). And the “ ‘heavy burden of persua[ding]’ the court that the challenged conduct cannot reasonably be expected to start up again\\n  \\n   lies with the party asserting mootness.” Friends of Earth, ante,\\n  \\n  at 189 (emphasis added) (quoting\\n  \\n   Concentrated Phosphate Export Assn., supra,\\n  \\n  at 203).\\n \\n\\n  Because respondents cannot satisfy this burden, the Tenth Circuit’s error was a crucial one. As common sense would suggest, and as the Tenth Circuit itself recognized, DOT accepts only “valid certification[s]” from state agencies. 169 F. 3d, at 1298. As respondents concede, however, see Brief in Opposition 13-14, n. 6, DOT has yet to approve — as it must—CDOT’s procedure for certifying disadvantaged business enterprises, see 64 Fed. Reg. 5129 (1999) (49 CFR § 26.21(b)(1)) (“[The State] must submit a [disadvantaged business enterprise] program conforming to this part by August 31, 1999 to the concerned operating administration”).\\n \\n\\n  DOT has promulgated regulations outlining the procedure state highway agencies must follow in certifying firms as disadvantaged business enterprises. See 64 Fed. Reg. 5096-5148 (pt. 26). As described earlier, those regulations require the agency to presume that “women, Black Americans, Hispanic Americans, Native Americans, Asian-Pacific Americans, Subcontinent Asian Americans, or other minorities found to be disadvantaged by the [Small Business Administration]” are socially disadvantaged.\\n  \\n   Id.,\\n  \\n  at 5136 (§ 26.67(a)(1)). Before individuals not members of those groups may be certified, the state agency must make individual determinations as to disadvantage. See\\n  \\n   id.,\\n  \\n  at 5136-5137 (§ 26.67(d)) (“In such a proceeding, the applicant firm\\n   \\n   *223\\n   \\n  has the burden of demonstrating to [the state highway-agency], by a preponderance of the evidence, that the individuals who own and control it are socially and economically disadvantaged”);\\n  \\n   id.,\\n  \\n  at 5147-5148 (pt. 26, subpt. D, App. E) (providing list of “elements” that highway agencies must consider in making individualized determinations of social disadvantage). CDOT’s new procedure under which petitioner was certified applies no presumption in favor of minority groups, and accepts without investigation a firm’s self-certification of entitlement to disadvantaged business status. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 109-111. Given the material differences (not to say incompatibility) between that procedure and the requirements of the DOT regulations, it is not at all clear that CDOT’s certification is a “valid certification,” and hence not at all clear that the Subcontractor Compensation Clause requires its acceptance.\\n \\n\\n  Before the Tenth Circuit, respondents took pains to “ex-presé] no opinion regarding the correctness of Colorado’s determination that [petitioner] is entitled to [disadvantaged business] status.” Motion by the Federal Appellants to Dismiss Appeal as Moot and to Vacate the District Court Judgment in No. 97-1304, p. 3, n. 2. Instead, they stated flatly that “in the event there is a third-party challenge to [petitioner’s] certification as a [disadvantaged business enterprise] and the decision on the challenge is appealed to DOT, DOT may review the decision to determine whether the certification was proper.”\\n  \\n   Id.,\\n  \\n  at 3-4, n. 2. In addition, DOT itself has the power to require States to initiate proceedings to withdraw a firm’s disadvantaged status if there is “reasonable cause to believe” that the firm “does not meet the eligibility criteria” set forth in the federal regulations. 64 Fed. Reg. 5142 (§ 26.87(e)(1)). Given the patent incompatibility of the certification with the federal regulations, it is far from clear that these possibilities will not become reality. Indeed, challenges to petitioner’s disadvantaged business status seem quite probable now that the Tenth Circuit, by\\n   \\n   *224\\n   \\n  vacating\\n  \\n   Adarand II,\\n  \\n  has eliminated the sole basis for petitioner’s certification in the first place.\\n \\n\\n  The Tenth Circuit dismissed these possibilities as insufficiently particular and concrete to grant standing and therefore “too conjectural and speculative to avoid a finding of mootness.” 169 F. 3d, at 1298 (internal quotation marks omitted). As we recently noted in\\n  \\n   Friends of the Earth,\\n  \\n  however, “[t]he plain lesson of [our precedents] is that there are circumstances in which the prospect that a defendant will engage in (or resume) harmful conduct may be too speculative to support standing, but not too speculative to overcome mootness.”\\n  \\n   Ante,\\n  \\n  at 190. Because, under the circumstances of this case, it is impossible to conclude that respondents have borne their burden of establishing that it is “absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur,”\\n  \\n   ante,\\n  \\n  at 189, petitioner’s cause of action remains alive.\\n \\n\\n\\n   * * *\\n  \\n\\n\\n  It is no small matter to deprive a litigant of the rewards of its efforts, particularly in a case that has been litigated up to this Court and back down again. Such action on grounds of mootness would be justified only if it were absolutely clear that the litigant no longer had any need of the judicial protection that it sought. Because that is not the case here, the petition for writ of certiorari is granted, the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\\n \\n\\n\\n   It is so ordered.\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n   1\\n  \\n\\n   Congress recently enacted the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, Pub. L. 105-178, Tit. I, § 1101(b), 112 Stat. 113, the successor appropriations measure to ISTEA. Although the new Act contains simi\\n    \\n    *218\\n    \\n   lar provisions, it is technically the provisions of ISTEA that apply to funding obligated in prior fiscal years but not yet expended.\\n  \\n\\n\\n   2\\n  \\n\\n   Before the Tenth Circuit, the parties disagreed as to whether the scope of the District Court’s remedial order was appropriate. In characterizing that order as we do here, we do not intend to take a position in that dispute.\\n  \\n   \n",

Plan participants may direct their contributions into any of a number of investment options, including an \"employee stock ownership plan\" (ESOP), which invests its funds primarily in Fifth Third stock. Respondents, former Fifth Third employees and ESOP participants, filed this lawsuit against petitioners, Fifth Third and several of its officers who are alleged to be fiduciaries of the ESOP. The complaint alleges that petitioners breached the fiduciary duty of prudence imposed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA),\\n  \\n   29 U.S.C. § 1104\\n  \\n  (a)(1)(B). Specifically, the complaint alleges that petitioners should have known-on the basis of both publicly available information and inside information available to petitioners because they were Fifth Third officers-that Fifth Third stock was overpriced and excessively risky. It further alleges that a prudent fiduciary in petitioners' position would have responded to this information by selling off the ESOP's holdings of Fifth Third stock, refraining from purchasing more Fifth Third stock, or disclosing the negative inside information so that the market could correct the stock's price downward. According to the complaint, petitioners did none of these things, and the price of Fifth Third stock ultimately fell, reducing respondents' retirement savings. The District Court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim, but the Sixth Circuit reversed. It concluded that ESOP fiduciaries are entitled to a\\n   \"presumption of prudence\" that does not apply to other ERISA fiduciaries but that the presumption is an evidentiary one and therefore does not apply at the pleading stage. The court went on to hold that the complaint stated a claim for breach of fiduciary duty.\\n \\n\\n\\n   Held\\n  \\n  :\\n \\n\\n  1. ESOP fiduciaries are not entitled to any special presumption of prudence. Rather, they are subject to the same duty of prudence that applies to ERISA fiduciaries in general, § 1104(a)(1)(B), except that they need not diversify the fund's assets, § 1104(a)(2). This conclusion follows from the relevant provisions of ERISA. Section 1104(a)(1)(B) \"imposes a 'prudent person' standard by which to measure fiduciaries' investment decisions and disposition of assets.\"\\n  \\n   Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Russell,\\n  \\n\\n   473 U.S. 134\\n  \\n  , 143, n. 10,\\n  \\n   105 S.Ct. 3085\\n  \\n  ,\\n  \\n   87 L.Ed.2d 96\\n  \\n  .Section 1104(a)(1)(C) requires ERISA fiduciaries to diversify plan assets. And § 1104(a)(2) establishes the extent to which those duties are loosened in the ESOP context by providing that \"the diversification requirement of [§ 1104(a)(1)(C) ] and the prudence requirement (only to the extent that it requires diversification) of [§ 1104(a)(1)(B) ] [are] not violated by acquisition or holding of [employer stock].\" Section 1104(a)(2) makes no reference to a special \"presumption\" in favor of ESOP fiduciaries and does not require plaintiffs to allege that the employer was,\\n  \\n   e.g.,\\n  \\n  on the \"brink of collapse.\" It simply modifies the duties imposed by § 1104(a)(1) in a precisely delineated way. Thus, aside from the fact that ESOP fiduciaries are not liable for losses that result from a failure to diversify, they are subject to the duty of prudence like other ERISA fiduciaries. Pp. 2465 - 2471.\\n \\n\\n  2. On remand, the Sixth Circuit should reconsider whether the complaint states a claim by applying the pleading standard as discussed in\\n  \\n   Ashcroft v. Iqbal,\\n  \\n\\n   556 U.S. 662\\n  \\n  , 677-680,\\n  \\n   129 S.Ct. 1937\\n  \\n  ,\\n  \\n   173 L.Ed.2d 868\\n  \\n  , and\\n  \\n   Bell Atlantic Corp. v.

Pp. 2471 - 2473.\\n \\n\\n  (a) Where a stock is publicly traded, allegations that a fiduciary should have recognized on the basis of publicly available information that the market was overvaluing or undervaluing the stock are generally implausible and thus insufficient to state a claim under\\n  \\n   Twombly\\n  \\n  and\\n  \\n   Iqbal\\n  \\n  . Pp. 2471 - 2472.\\n \\n\\n  (b) To state a claim for breach of the duty of prudence, a complaint must plausibly allege an alternative action that the defendant could have taken, that would have been legal, and that a prudent fiduciary in the same circumstances would not have viewed as more likely to harm the fund than to help it. Where the complaint alleges that a fiduciary was imprudent in failing to act on the basis of inside information, the analysis is informed by the following points. First, ERISA's duty of prudence never requires a fiduciary to break the law, and so a fiduciary cannot be imprudent for failing to buy or sell stock in violation of the insider trading laws. Second, where a complaint faults fiduciaries for failing to decide, based on negative inside information, to refrain from making additional stock purchases or for failing to publicly disclose that information so that the stock would no longer be overvalued, courts should consider the extent to which imposing an ERISA-based obligation either to refrain from making a planned trade or to disclose inside information to the public could conflict with the complex insider trading and corporate disclosure requirements set forth by the federal securities laws or with the objectives of those laws. Third, courts confronted with such claims should consider whether the complaint\\n   has plausibly alleged that a prudent fiduciary in the defendant's position could not have concluded that stopping purchases or publicly disclosing negative information would do more harm than good to the fund by causing a drop in the stock price and a concomitant drop in the value of the stock already held by the fund.

This case focuses upon that duty of prudence as applied to the fiduciary of an \"employee stock ownership plan\" (ESOP), a type of pension plan that invests primarily in the stock of the company that employs the plan participants.\\n \\n\\n  We consider whether, when an ESOP fiduciary's decision to buy or hold the employer's stock is challenged in court, the fiduciary is entitled to a defense-friendly standard that the lower courts have called a \"presumption of prudence.\" The Courts of Appeals that have considered the question have held that such a presumption does apply, with the presumption generally defined as a requirement that the plaintiff make a showing that would not be required in an ordinary duty-of-prudence case, such as that the employer was on the brink of collapse.\\n \\n\\n  We hold that no such presumption applies. Instead, ESOP fiduciaries are subject to the same duty of prudence that applies to ERISA fiduciaries in general, except that they need not diversify the fund's assets. § 1104(a)(2).\\n \\n\\n\\n   I\\n  \\n\\n\\n  Petitioner Fifth Third Bancorp, a large financial services firm, maintains for its employees a defined-contribution retirement savings plan. Employees may choose to contribute a portion of their compensation to the Plan as retirement savings, and Fifth Third provides matching contributions of up to 4% of an employee's compensation. The Plan's assets are invested in 20 separate funds, including\\n    mutual funds and an ESOP. Plan participants can allocate their contributions among the funds however they like; Fifth Third's matching contributions, on the other hand, are always invested initially in the ESOP, though the participant can then choose to move them to another fund. The Plan requires the ESOP's funds to be \"invested primarily in shares of common stock of Fifth Third.\" App. 350.\\n \\n\\n  Respondents, who are former Fifth Third employees and ESOP participants, filed this putative class action in Federal District Court in Ohio. They claim that petitioners, Fifth Third and various Fifth Third officers, were fiduciaries of the Plan and violated the duties of loyalty and prudence imposed by ERISA. See §§ 1109(a), 1132(a)(2). We limit our review to the duty-of-prudence claims.\\n \\n\\n  The complaint alleges that by July 2007, the fiduciaries knew or should have known that Fifth Third's stock was overvalued and excessively risky for two separate reasons. First, publicly available information such as newspaper articles provided early warning signs that subprime lending, which formed a large part of Fifth Third's business, would soon leave creditors high and dry as the housing market collapsed and subprime borrowers became unable to pay off their mortgages. Second, nonpublic information (which petitioners knew because they were Fifth Third insiders) indicated that Fifth Third officers had deceived the market by making material misstatements about the company's financial prospects. Those misstatements led the market to overvalue Fifth Third stock-the ESOP's primary investment-and so petitioners, using the participants' money, were consequently paying more for that stock than it was worth.\\n \\n\\n  The complaint further alleges that a prudent fiduciary in petitioners' position would have responded to this information in one or more of the following ways: (1) by selling the ESOP's holdings of Fifth Third stock before the value of those holdings declined, (2) by refraining from purchasing any more Fifth Third stock, (3) by canceling the Plan's ESOP option, and (4) by disclosing the inside information so that the market would adjust its valuation of Fifth Third stock downward and the ESOP would no longer be overpaying for it.\\n \\n\\n  Rather than follow any of these courses of action, petitioners continued to hold and buy Fifth Third stock. Then the market crashed, and Fifth Third's stock price fell by 74% between July 2007 and September 2009, when the complaint was filed. Since the ESOP's funds were invested primarily in Fifth Third stock, this fall in price eliminated a large part of the retirement savings that the participants had invested in the ESOP. (The stock has since made a partial recovery to around half of its July 2007 price.)\\n \\n\\n  The District Court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim.\\n  \\n   757 F.Supp.2d 753\\n  \\n  (S.D.Ohio 2010). The court began from the premise that where a lawsuit challenges ESOP fiduciaries' investment decisions, \"the plan fiduciaries start with a presumption that their 'decision to remain invested in employer securities was reasonable.' \"\\n  \\n\\n    Id.,\\n   \\n\\n\\n   at 758\\n  \\n  (quoting\\n  \\n   Kuper v. Iovenko,\\n  \\n\\n   66 F.3d 1447\\n  \\n  , 1459 (C.A.6 1995)). The court next held that this rule is applicable at the pleading stage and then concluded that the complaint's allegations were insufficient to overcome it.\\n  \\n   757 F.Supp.2d, at 758-759, 760-762\\n  \\n  .\\n \\n\\n  The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed.\\n  \\n   692 F.3d 410\\n  \\n  (2012). Although it agreed that ESOP fiduciaries are entitled to a presumption of prudence, it took the view that the presumption is evidentiary only and therefore does not apply at the pleading stage.\\n  \\n\\n    Id.,\\n   \\n\\n\\n   at 418-419\\n  \\n  .\\n \\n\\n  Thus, the Sixth Circuit simply asked whether the allegations in the complaint were sufficient to state a claim for breach of fiduciary duty.\\n  \\n\\n    Id.,\\n   \\n\\n\\n   at 419\\n  \\n  . It held that they were.\\n  \\n\\n    Id.,\\n   \\n\\n\\n   at 419-420\\n  \\n  .\\n \\n\\n  In light of differences among the Courts of Appeals as to the nature of the presumption of prudence applicable to ESOP fiduciaries, we granted the fiduciaries' petition for certiorari.

On the one hand, ERISA itself subjects pension plan fiduciaries to a duty of prudence. In a section titled \"Fiduciary duties,\" it says:\\n \\n\\n  \"(a)\\n  \\n   Prudent man standard of care\\n  \\n\\n\\n  \"(1) Subject to sections 1103(c) and (d), 1342, and 1344 of this title, a fiduciary shall discharge his duties with respect to a plan solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries and-\\n \\n\\n  \"(A) for the exclusive purpose of:\\n \\n\\n  \"(i) providing benefits to participants and their beneficiaries; and\\n \\n\\n  \"(ii) defraying reasonable expenses of administering the plan;\\n \\n\\n  \"(B) with the care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing that a prudent man acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character and with like aims;\\n \\n\\n  \"(C) by diversifying the investments of the plan so as to minimize the risk of large losses, unless under the circumstances it is clearly prudent not to do so; and\\n \\n\\n  \"(D) in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the plan insofar as such documents and instruments are consistent with the provisions of this subchapter and subchapter III of this chapter.\" § 1104.\\n \\n\\n  See also\\n  \\n   Central States, Southeast & Southwest Areas Pension Fund v. Central Transport, Inc.,\\n  \\n\\n   472 U.S. 559\\n  \\n  , 570,\\n  \\n   105 S.Ct. 2833\\n  \\n  ,\\n  \\n   86 L.Ed.2d 447\\n  \\n  (1985) (Section 1104(a)(1) imposes \"strict standards of trustee conduct ... derived from the common law of trusts-most prominently, a standard of loyalty and a standard of care\").\\n \\n\\n  On the other hand, Congress recognizes that ESOPs are \"designed to invest primarily in\" the stock of the participants' employer, § 1107(d)(6)(A), meaning that they are\\n  \\n   not\\n  \\n  prudently diversified. And it has written into law its \"interest in encouraging\" their use. One statutory provision says:\\n \\n\\n  \"Intent of Congress Concerning Employee Stock Ownership Plans.-The Congress, in a series of laws [including ERISA] has made clear its interest in encouraging [ESOPs] as a bold and innovative method of strengthening the\\n    free private enterprise system which will solve the dual problems of securing capital funds for necessary capital growth and of bringing about stock ownership by all corporate employees. The Congress is deeply concerned that the objectives sought by this series of laws will be made unattainable by regulations and rulings which treat [ESOPs] as conventional retirement plans, which reduce the freedom of the employee trusts and employers to take the necessary steps to implement the plans, and which otherwise block the establishment and success of these plans.\" Tax Reform Act of 1976, § 803(h),\\n  \\n   90 Stat. 1590\\n  \\n  .\\n \\n\\n  In addition, and in keeping with this statement of intent, Congress has given ESOP fiduciaries a statutory exemption from some of the duties imposed on ERISA fiduciaries. ERISA specifically provides that, in the case of ESOPs and other eligible individual account plans,\\n \\n\\n  \"the diversification requirement of [§ 1104(a)(1)(C) ] and the prudence requirement (only to the extent that it requires diversification) of [§ 1104(a)(1)(B) ] [are] not violated by acquisition or holding of [employer stock].\" § 1104(a)(2).\\n \\n\\n  Thus, an ESOP fiduciary is not obliged under § 1104(a)(1)(C) to \"diversif[y] the investments of the plan so as to minimize the risk of large losses\" or under § 1104(a)(1)(B) to act \"with the care, skill, prudence, and diligence\" of a \"prudent man\" insofar as that duty \"requires diversification.\"\\n \\n\\n\\n   B\\n  \\n\\n\\n  Several Courts of Appeals have gone beyond ERISA's express provision that ESOP fiduciaries need not diversify by giving ESOP fiduciaries a \"presumption of prudence\" when their decisions to hold or buy employer stock are challenged as imprudent. Thus, the Third Circuit has held that \"an ESOP fiduciary who invests the [ESOP's] assets in employer stock is entitled to a presumption that it acted consistently with ERISA\" in doing so.\\n  \\n   Moench v. Robertson,\\n  \\n\\n   62 F.3d 553\\n  \\n  , 571 (1995). The Ninth Circuit has said that to \"overcome the presumption of prudent investment, plaintiffs must ... make allegations that clearly implicate the company's viability as an ongoing concern or show a precipitous decline in the employer's stock ... combined with evidence that the company is on the brink of collapse or is undergoing serious mismanagement.\"\\n  \\n   Quan v. Computer Sciences Corp.,\\n  \\n\\n   623 F.3d 870\\n  \\n  , 882 (2010) (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted). And the Seventh Circuit has described the presumption as requiring plaintiffs to \"allege and ultimately prove that the company faced 'impending collapse' or 'dire circumstances' that could not have been foreseen by the founder of the plan.\"\\n  \\n   White v. Marshall & Ilsley Corp.,\\n  \\n\\n   714 F.3d 980\\n  \\n  , 989 (2013).\\n \\n\\n  The Sixth Circuit agreed that some sort of presumption favoring an ESOP fiduciary's purchase of employer stock is appropriate. But it held that this presumption is an evidentiary rule that does not apply at the pleading stage. It further held that, to overcome the presumption, a plaintiff need not show that the employer was on the \"brink of collapse\" or the like. Rather, the plaintiff need only show that \" 'a prudent fiduciary acting under similar circumstances would have made a different investment decision.' \"\\n  \\n   692 F.3d, at 418\\n  \\n  (quoting\\n  \\n   Kuper,\\n  \\n\\n   66 F.3d, at 1459\\n  \\n  ).\\n \\n\\n  Petitioners argue that the lower courts are right to apply a presumption of prudence, that it should apply from the pleading stage onward, and that the presumption should be strongly in favor of ESOP fiduciaries' purchasing and holding of employer stock.\\n \\n\\n  In particular, petitioners propose a rule that a challenge to an ESOP fiduciary's decision to hold or buy company stock \"cannot prevail unless extraordinary circumstances, such as a serious threat to the employer's viability, mean that continued investment would substantially impair the purpose of the plan.\" Brief for Petitioners 16. In petitioners' view, the \"purpose of the plan,\" in the case of an ESOP, is promoting employee ownership of the employer's stock over the long term. And, petitioners assert, that purpose is \"substantially impair[ed]\"-rendering continued investment imprudent-only when \"a serious threat to the employer's viability\" makes it likely that the employer will go out of business. This is because the goal of employee ownership will be substantially impaired only if the employer goes out of business, leaving the employees with no company to own.\\n  \\n   Id.,\\n  \\n  at 24.\\n \\n\\n  We must decide whether ERISA contains some such presumption.\\n \\n\\n\\n   III\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n   A\\n  \\n\\n\\n  In our view, the law does not create a special presumption favoring ESOP fiduciaries. Rather, the same standard of prudence applies to all ERISA fiduciaries, including ESOP fiduciaries, except that an ESOP fiduciary is under no duty to diversify the ESOP's holdings. This conclusion follows from the pertinent provisions of ERISA, which are set forth above.\\n \\n\\n  Section 1104(a)(1)(B) \"imposes a 'prudent person' standard by which to measure fiduciaries' investment decisions and disposition of assets.\"\\n  \\n   Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Russell,\\n  \\n\\n   473 U.S. 134\\n  \\n  , 143, n. 10,\\n  \\n   105 S.Ct. 3085\\n  \\n  ,\\n  \\n   87 L.Ed.2d 96\\n  \\n  (1985). Section 1104(a)(1)(C) requires ERISA fiduciaries to diversify plan assets. And § 1104(a)(2) establishes the extent to which those duties are loosened in the ESOP context to ensure that employers are permitted and encouraged to offer ESOPs. Section 1104(a)(2) makes no reference to a special \"presumption\" in favor of ESOP fiduciaries. It does not require plaintiffs to allege that the employer was on the \"brink of collapse,\" under \"extraordinary circumstances,\" or the like. Instead, § 1104(a)(2) simply modifies the duties imposed by § 1104(a)(1) in a precisely delineated way: It provides that an ESOP fiduciary is exempt from § 1104(a)(1)(C)'s diversification requirement and also from § 1104(a)(1)(B)'s duty of prudence, but \"\\n  \\n   only to the extent that it requires diversification\\n  \\n  .\" § 1104(a)(2) (emphasis added).\\n \\n\\n  Thus, ESOP fiduciaries, unlike ERISA fiduciaries generally, are not liable for losses that result from a failure to diversify. But aside from that distinction, because ESOP fiduciaries are ERISA fiduciaries and because § 1104(a)(1)(B)'s duty of prudence applies to all ERISA fiduciaries, ESOP fiduciaries are subject to the duty of prudence just as other ERISA fiduciaries are.\\n \\n\\n\\n   B\\n  \\n\\n\\n  Petitioners make several arguments to the contrary. First, petitioners argue that the special purpose of an ESOP-investing participants' savings in the stock of their employer-calls for a presumption that such investments are prudent. Their argument is as follows: ERISA defines the duty of prudence in terms of what a prudent person would do \"in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character and with like aims.\" § 1104(a)(1)(B). The \"character\" and \"aims\" of an ESOP differ from those of an ordinary retirement investment, such as a diversified mutual fund. An ordinary plan seeks (1) to maximize retirement savings\\n    for participants while (2) avoiding excessive risk. But an ESOP also seeks (3) to promote employee ownership of employer stock. For instance, Fifth Third's Plan requires the ESOP's assets to be \"invested primarily in shares of common stock of Fifth Third.\" App. 350. In light of this additional goal, an ESOP fiduciary's decision to buy more shares of employer stock, even if it would be imprudent were it viewed solely as an attempt to secure financial retirement benefits while avoiding excessive risk, might nonetheless be prudent if understood as an attempt to promote employee ownership of employer stock, a goal that Congress views as important. See Tax Reform Act of 1976, § 803(h),\\n  \\n   90 Stat. 1590\\n  \\n  . Thus, a claim that an ESOP fiduciary's investment in employer stock was imprudent as a way of securing retirement savings should be viewed unfavorably because, unless the company was about to go out of business, that investment was advancing the additional goal of employee ownership of employer stock.\\n \\n\\n  We cannot accept the claim that underlies this argument, namely, that the content of ERISA's duty of prudence varies depending upon the specific nonpecuniary goal set out in an ERISA plan, such as what petitioners claim is the nonpecuniary goal here. Taken in context, § 1104(a)(1)(B)'s reference to \"an enterprise of a like character and with like aims\" means an enterprise with what the immediately preceding provision calls the \"exclusive purpose\" to be pursued by all ERISA fiduciaries: \"providing benefits to participants and their beneficiaries\" while \"defraying reasonable expenses of administering the plan.\" §§ 1104(a)(1)(A)(i), (ii). Read in the context of ERISA as a whole, the term \"benefits\" in the provision just quoted must be understood to refer to the sort of\\n  \\n   financial\\n  \\n  benefits (such as retirement income) that trustees who manage investments typically seek to secure for the trust's beneficiaries. Cf. § 1002(2)(A) (defining \"employee pension benefit plan\" and \"pension plan\" to mean plans that provide employees with \"retirement income\" or other \"deferral of income\"). The term does not cover nonpecuniary benefits like those supposed to arise from employee ownership of employer stock.\\n \\n\\n  Consider the statute's requirement that fiduciaries act \"in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the plan\\n  \\n   insofar as such documents and instruments are consistent with the provisions of this subchapter\\n  \\n  .\" § 1104(a)(1)(D) (emphasis added). This provision makes clear that the duty of prudence trumps the instructions of a plan document, such as an instruction to invest exclusively in employer stock even if financial goals demand the contrary. See also § 1110(a) (With irrelevant exceptions, \"any provision in an agreement or instrument which purports to relieve a fiduciary from responsibility ... for any ... duty under this part shall be void as against public policy\"). This rule would make little sense if, as petitioners argue, the duty of prudence is defined by the aims of the particular plan as set out in the plan documents, since in that case the duty of prudence could never conflict with a plan document.\\n \\n\\n  Consider also § 1104(a)(2), which exempts an ESOP fiduciary from § 1104(a)(1)(B)'s duty of prudence but \"only to the extent that it requires diversification.\" What need would there be for this specific provision were the nature of § 1104(a)(1)(B)'s duty of prudence altered anyway in the case of an ESOP in light of the ESOP's aim of promoting employee ownership of employer stock? Cf.\\n  \\n   Arlington Central School Dist. Bd. of Ed. v. Murphy,\\n  \\n\\n   548 U.S. 291\\n  \\n  , 299, n. 1,\\n  \\n   126 S.Ct. 2455\\n  \\n  ,\\n  \\n   165 L.Ed.2d 526\\n  \\n  (2006) (\"[I]t is generally\\n    presumed that statutes do not contain surplusage\").\\n \\n\\n  Petitioners are right to point out that\\n  \\n   Congress,\\n  \\n  in seeking to permit and promote ESOPs, was pursuing purposes other than the financial security of plan participants. See,\\n  \\n   e.g.,\\n  \\n  Tax Reform Act of 1976, § 803(h),\\n  \\n   90 Stat. 1590\\n  \\n  (Congress intended ESOPs to help \"secur[e] capital funds for necessary capital growth and ... brin[g] about stock ownership by all corporate employees\"). Congress pursued those purposes by promoting ESOPs with tax incentives. See\\n  \\n   26 U.S.C. §§ 402\\n  \\n  (e)(4), 404(k), 1042. And it also pursued them by exempting ESOPs from ERISA's diversification requirement, which otherwise would have precluded their creation.\\n  \\n   29 U.S.C. § 1104\\n  \\n  (a)(2). But we are not convinced that Congress\\n  \\n   also\\n  \\n  sought to promote ESOPs by further relaxing the duty of prudence as applied to ESOPs with the sort of presumption proposed by petitioners.\\n \\n\\n  Second, and relatedly, petitioners contend that the duty of prudence should be read in light of the rule under the common law of trusts that \"the settlor can reduce or waive the prudent man standard of care by specific language in the trust instrument.\" G. Bogert & G. Bogert, Law of Trusts and Trustees § 541, p. 172 (rev. 2d ed. 1993); see also Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 174, Comment\\n  \\n   d\\n  \\n  (1957) (\"By the terms of the trust the requirement of care and skill may be relaxed or modified\"). The argument is that, by commanding the ESOP fiduciary to invest primarily in Fifth Third stock, the plan documents waived the duty of prudence to the extent that it comes into conflict with investment in Fifth Third stock-at least unless \"extraordinary circumstances\" arise that so threaten the goal of employee ownership of Fifth Third stock that the fiduciaries must assume that the settlor would want them to depart from that goal under the common-law \"deviation doctrine.\" See\\n  \\n\\n    id.,\\n   \\n\\n  § 167. This argument fails, however, in light of this Court's holding that, by contrast to the rule at common law, \"trust documents cannot excuse trustees from their duties under ERISA.\"\\n  \\n   Central States, Southeast & Southwest Areas Pension Fund,\\n  \\n\\n   472 U.S., at 568\\n  \\n  ,\\n  \\n   105 S.Ct. 2833\\n  \\n  ; see also\\n  \\n   29 U.S.C. §§ 1104\\n  \\n  (a)(1)(D), 1110(a).\\n \\n\\n  Third, petitioners argue that subjecting ESOP fiduciaries to a duty of prudence without the protection of a special presumption will lead to conflicts with the legal prohibition on insider trading. The potential for conflict arises because ESOP fiduciaries often are company insiders and because suits against insider fiduciaries frequently allege, as the complaint in this case alleges, that the fiduciaries were imprudent in failing to act on inside information they had about the value of the employer's stock.\\n \\n\\n  This concern is a legitimate one. But an ESOP-specific rule that a fiduciary does not act imprudently in buying or holding company stock unless the company is on the brink of collapse (or the like) is an ill-fitting means of addressing it. While ESOP fiduciaries may be more likely to have insider information about a company that the fund is investing in than are other ERISA fiduciaries, the potential for conflict with the securities laws would be the same for a non-ESOP fiduciary who had relevant inside information about a potential investment. And the potential for conflict is the same for an ESOP fiduciary whose company is on the brink of collapse as for a fiduciary who is invested in a healthier company. (Surely a fiduciary is not obligated to break the insider trading laws even if his company is about to fail.) The potential for conflict therefore does not persuade us to accept a presumption of\\n    the sort adopted by the lower courts and proposed by petitioners. We discuss alternative means of dealing with the potential for conflict in Part IV,\\n  \\n   infra\\n  \\n  .\\n \\n\\n  Finally, petitioners argue that, without some sort of special presumption, the threat of costly duty-of-prudence lawsuits will deter companies from offering ESOPs to their employees, contrary to the stated intent of Congress. Cf.\\n  \\n   Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co.,\\n  \\n\\n   473 U.S., at 148, n. 17\\n  \\n  ,\\n  \\n   105 S.Ct. 3085\\n  \\n  (\"Congress was concerned lest the cost of federal standards discourage the growth of private pension plans\"). ESOP plans instruct their fiduciaries to invest in company stock, and § 1104(a)(1)(D) requires fiduciaries to follow plan documents so long as they do not conflict with ERISA. Thus, in many cases an ESOP fiduciary who fears that continuing to invest in company stock may be imprudent finds himself between a rock and a hard place: If he keeps investing and the stock goes down he may be sued for acting imprudently in violation of § 1104(a)(1)(B), but if he stops investing and the stock goes up he may be sued for disobeying the plan documents in violation of § 1104(a)(1)(D). See,\\n  \\n   e.g.,\\n  \\n\\n   White,\\n  \\n\\n   714 F.3d, at 987\\n  \\n  (\"[F]iduciaries could be liable either for the company stock's poor performance if they continue to invest in employer stock, or for missing the opportunity to benefit from good performance if they do not.... Such a high exposure to litigation risks in either direction could discourage employers from offering ESOPs, which are favored by Congress\");\\n  \\n   Evans v. Akers,\\n  \\n\\n   534 F.3d 65\\n  \\n  , 68 (C.A.1 2008) (describing two lawsuits challenging the decisions of a plan's fiduciaries with \"diametrically opposed theor[ies] of liability\": one arguing that the fiduciaries acted imprudently by continuing to invest in company stock, and the other contending that they acted imprudently by divesting \"despite the company's solid potential to emerge from bankruptcy with substantial value for shareholders\"). Petitioners argue that, given the threat of such expensive litigation, ESOPs cannot thrive unless their fiduciaries are granted a defense-friendly presumption.\\n \\n\\n  Petitioners are basically seeking relief from what they believe are meritless, economically burdensome lawsuits. We agree that Congress sought to encourage the creation of ESOPs. And we have recognized that \"ERISA represents a ' \"careful balancing\" between ensuring fair and prompt enforcement of rights under a plan and the encouragement of the creation of such plans.' \"\\n  \\n   Conkright v. Frommert,\\n  \\n\\n   559 U.S. 506\\n  \\n  , 517,\\n  \\n   130 S.Ct. 1640\\n  \\n  ,\\n  \\n   176 L.Ed.2d 469\\n  \\n  (2010) (quoting\\n  \\n   Aetna Health Inc. v. Davila,\\n  \\n\\n   542 U.S. 200\\n  \\n  , 215,\\n  \\n   124 S.Ct. 2488\\n  \\n  ,\\n  \\n   159 L.Ed.2d 312\\n  \\n  (2004)); see also\\n  \\n   Varity Corp. v. Howe,\\n  \\n\\n   516 U.S. 489\\n  \\n  , 497,\\n  \\n   116 S.Ct. 1065\\n  \\n  ,\\n  \\n   134 L.Ed.2d 130\\n  \\n  (1996) (In \"interpret[ing] ERISA's fiduciary duties,\" \"courts may have to take account of competing congressional purposes, such as Congress' desire to offer employees enhanced protection for their benefits, on the one hand, and, on the other, its desire not to create a system that is so complex that administrative costs, or litigation expenses, unduly discourage employers from offering welfare benefit plans in the first place\").\\n \\n\\n  At the same time, we do not believe that the presumption at issue here is an appropriate way to weed out meritless lawsuits or to provide the requisite \"balancing.\" The proposed presumption makes it impossible for a plaintiff to state a duty-of-prudence claim, no matter how meritorious, unless the employer is in very bad economic circumstances. Such a rule does not readily divide the plausible sheep from the meritless goats. That important task can be better accomplished through careful, context-sensitive scrutiny of a complaint's allegations. We consequently\\n    stand by our conclusion that the law does not create a special presumption of prudence for ESOP fiduciaries.\\n \\n\\n\\n   IV\\n  \\n\\n\\n  We consider more fully one important mechanism for weeding out meritless claims, the motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. That mechanism, which gave rise to the lower court decisions at issue here, requires careful judicial consideration of whether the complaint states a claim that the defendant has acted imprudently. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 12(b)(6);\\n  \\n   Ashcroft v. Iqbal,\\n  \\n\\n   556 U.S. 662\\n  \\n  , 677-680,\\n  \\n   129 S.Ct. 1937\\n  \\n  ,\\n  \\n   173 L.Ed.2d 868\\n  \\n  (2009);\\n  \\n   Bell Atlantic Corp. v.

Because the content of the duty of prudence turns on \"the circumstances ... prevailing\" at the time the fiduciary acts, § 1104(a)(1)(B), the appropriate inquiry will necessarily be context specific.\\n \\n\\n  The District Court in this case granted petitioners' motion to dismiss the complaint because it held that respondents could not overcome the presumption of prudence. The Court of Appeals, by contrast, concluded that no presumption applied. And we agree with that conclusion. The Court of Appeals, however, went on to hold that respondents had stated a plausible duty-of-prudence claim.\\n  \\n   692 F.3d, at 419-420\\n  \\n  . The arguments made here, along with our review of the record, convince us that the judgment of the Court of Appeals should be vacated and the case remanded. On remand, the Court of Appeals should apply the pleading standard as discussed in\\n  \\n   Twombly\\n  \\n  and\\n  \\n   Iqbal\\n  \\n  in light of the following considerations.\\n \\n\\n\\n   A\\n  \\n\\n\\n  Respondents allege that, as of July 2007, petitioners knew or should have known in light of publicly available information, such as newspaper articles, that continuing to hold and purchase Fifth Third stock was imprudent. App. 48-53. The complaint alleges, among other things, that petitioners \"continued to allow the Plan's investment in Fifth Third Stock even during the time that the stock price was declining in value as a result of [the] collapse of the housing market\" and that \"[a] prudent fiduciary facing similar circumstances would not have stood idly by as the Plan's assets were decimated.\"\\n  \\n   Id.,\\n  \\n  at 53.\\n \\n\\n  In our view, where a stock is publicly traded, allegations that a fiduciary should have recognized from publicly available information alone that the market was over- or undervaluing the stock are implausible as a general rule, at least in the absence of special circumstances. Many investors take the view that \" 'they have little hope of outperforming the market in the long run based solely on their analysis of publicly available information,' \" and accordingly they \" 'rely on the security's market price as an unbiased assessment of the security's value in light of all public information.' \"\\n  \\n   Halliburton Co. v. Erica P. John Fund, Inc.\\n  \\n  --- U.S. ----, ----,\\n  \\n   134 S.Ct. 2398\\n  \\n  , 2411,\\n  \\n   189 L.Ed.2d 339\\n  \\n  ,\\n  \\n   2014 WL 2807181\\n  \\n  (2014) (quoting\\n  \\n   Amgen Inc. v. Connecticut Retirement Plans and Trust Funds,\\n  \\n  568 U.S. ----, ----,\\n  \\n   133 S.Ct. 1184\\n  \\n  , 1192,\\n  \\n   185 L.Ed.2d 308\\n  \\n  (2013)). ERISA fiduciaries, who likewise could reasonably see \"little hope of outperforming the market ... based solely on their analysis of publicly available information,\"\\n  \\n   ibid.,\\n  \\n  may, as a general matter, likewise prudently rely on the market price.\\n \\n\\n  In other words, a fiduciary usually \"is not imprudent to assume that a major stock market ... provides the best estimate of the value of the stocks traded on it that is available to him.\"\\n \\n\\n\\n   Summers v. State Street Bank & Trust Co.,\\n  \\n\\n   453 F.3d 404\\n  \\n  , 408 (C.A.7 2006); see also\\n  \\n   White,\\n  \\n\\n   714 F.3d, at 992\\n  \\n  (A fiduciary's \"fail[ure] to outsmart a presumptively efficient market ... is ... not a sound basis for imposing liability\"); cf.\\n  \\n   Quan,\\n  \\n\\n   623 F.3d, at 881\\n  \\n  (\"Fiduciaries are not expected to predict the future of the company stock's performance\").\\n \\n\\n  We do not here consider whether a plaintiff could nonetheless plausibly allege imprudence on the basis of publicly available information by pointing to a special circumstance affecting the reliability of the market price as \" 'an unbiased assessment of the security's value in light of all public information,' \"\\n  \\n   Halliburton Co., supra,\\n  \\n  at ----,\\n  \\n   134 S.Ct., at 2411\\n  \\n  (quoting\\n  \\n   Amgen Inc., supra,\\n  \\n  at ----,\\n  \\n   133 S.Ct., at 1192\\n  \\n  ), that would make reliance on the market's valuation imprudent. In this case, the Court of Appeals held that the complaint stated a claim because respondents \"allege that Fifth Third engaged in lending practices that were equivalent to participation in the subprime lending market, that Defendants were aware of the risks of such investments by the start of the class period, and that such risks made Fifth Third stock an imprudent investment.\"\\n  \\n   692 F.3d, at 419-420\\n  \\n  . The Court of Appeals did not point to any special circumstance rendering reliance on the market price imprudent. The court's decision to deny dismissal therefore appears to have been based on an erroneous understanding of the prudence of relying on market prices.\\n \\n\\n\\n   B\\n  \\n\\n\\n  Respondents also claim that petitioners behaved imprudently by failing to act on the basis of\\n  \\n   nonpublic\\n  \\n  information that was available to them because they were Fifth Third insiders. In particular, the complaint alleges that petitioners had inside information indicating that the market was overvaluing Fifth Third stock and that they could have used this information to prevent losses to the fund by (1) selling the ESOP's holdings of Fifth Third stock; (2) refraining from future stock purchases (including by removing the Plan's ESOP option altogether); or (3) publicly disclosing the inside information so that the market would correct the stock price downward, with the result that the ESOP could continue to buy Fifth Third stock without paying an inflated price for it. See App. 17, 88-89, 113.\\n \\n\\n  To state a claim for breach of the duty of prudence on the basis of inside information, a plaintiff must plausibly allege an alternative action that the defendant could have taken that would have been consistent with the securities laws and that a prudent fiduciary in the same circumstances would not have viewed as more likely to harm the fund than to help it. The following three points inform the requisite analysis.\\n \\n\\n  First, in deciding whether the complaint states a claim upon which relief can be granted, courts must bear in mind that the duty of prudence, under ERISA as under the common law of trusts, does not require a fiduciary to break the law. Cf. Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 166, Comment\\n  \\n   a\\n  \\n  (\"The trustee is not under a duty to the beneficiary to do an act which is criminal or tortious\"). Federal securities laws \"are violated when a corporate insider trades in the securities of his corporation on the basis of material, nonpublic information.\"\\n  \\n   United States v. O'Hagan,\\n  \\n\\n   521 U.S. 642\\n  \\n  , 651-652,\\n  \\n   117 S.Ct. 2199\\n  \\n  ,\\n  \\n   138 L.Ed.2d 724\\n  \\n  (1997). As every Court of Appeals to address the question has held, ERISA's duty of prudence cannot require an ESOP fiduciary to perform an action-such as divesting the fund's holdings of the employer's stock on the basis of inside information-that would violate the securities laws. See,\\n  \\n   e.g.,\\n  \\n\\n   Rinehart v. Akers,\\n  \\n\\n   722 F.3d 137\\n  \\n  , 146-147 (C.A.2 2013);\\n  \\n   Kirschbaum v. Reliant Energy, Inc.,\\n  \\n\\n   526 F.3d 243\\n  \\n  , 256 (C.A.5 2008);\\n  \\n   White,\\n   \\n    supra,\\n   \\n\\n\\n   at 992\\n  \\n  ;\\n  \\n   Quan,\\n   \\n    supra,\\n   \\n\\n\\n   at 881-882\\n  \\n  , and n. 8;\\n  \\n   Lanfear v. Home Depot, Inc.,\\n  \\n\\n   679 F.3d 1267\\n  \\n  , 1282 (C.A.11 2012). To the extent that the Sixth Circuit denied dismissal based on the theory that the duty of prudence required petitioners to sell the ESOP's holdings of Fifth Third stock, its denial of dismissal was erroneous.\\n \\n\\n  Second, where a complaint faults fiduciaries for failing to decide, on the basis of the inside information, to refrain from making additional stock purchases or for failing to disclose that information to the public so that the stock would no longer be overvalued, additional considerations arise. The courts should consider the extent to which an ERISA-based obligation either to refrain on the basis of inside information from making a planned trade or to disclose inside information to the public could conflict with the complex insider trading and corporate disclosure requirements imposed by the federal securities laws or with the objectives of those laws. Cf.\\n  \\n   29 U.S.C. § 1144\\n  \\n  (d) (\"Nothing in this subchapter [which includes § 1104] shall be construed to alter, amend, modify, invalidate, impair, or supersede any law of the United States ... or any rule or regulation issued under any such law\");\\n  \\n   Black & Decker Disability Plan v.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has not advised us of its views on these matters, and we believe those views may well be relevant.\\n \\n\\n  Third, lower courts faced with such claims should also consider whether the complaint has plausibly alleged that a prudent fiduciary in the defendant's position could not have concluded that stopping purchases-which the market might take as a sign that insider fiduciaries viewed the employer's stock as a bad investment-or publicly disclosing negative information would do more harm than good to the fund by causing a drop in the stock price and a concomitant drop in the value of the stock already held by the fund.\\n \\n\\n  * * *\\n \\n\\n  We leave it to the courts below to apply the foregoing to the complaint in this case in the first instance.

Michigan Dept. of Treasury, 489 U. S. 803 (1989), we held that a State violates the constitutional doctrine of intergovernmental tax immunity when it taxes retirement benefits paid by the Federal Government but exempts from taxation all retirement benefits paid by the State or its political subdivisions. Relying on the retroactivity analysis of Chevron Oil Co. v. Huson, 404 U. S. 97 (1971), the Supreme Court of Virginia twice refused to apply Davis to *90 taxes imposed before Davis was decided. In accord with Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U. S. 314 (1987), and James B. Beam Distilling Co. v. Georgia, 501 U. S. 529 (1991), we hold that this Court's application of a rule of federal law to the parties before the Court requires every court to give retroactive effect to that decision. We therefore reverse.\\n\\nI\\nThe Michigan tax scheme at issue in Davis \"exempt[ed] from taxation all retirement benefits paid by the State or its political subdivisions, but levie[d] an income tax on retirement benefits paid by . . . the Federal Government.\" 489 U.

C. § 111[1] to this discriminatory imposition of a heavier tax burden on federal benefits than on state and local benefits. 489 U. S., at 808-817. Because Michigan \"conceded that a refund [was] appropriate,\" we recognized that federal retirees were entitled to a refund of taxes \"paid. . . pursuant to this invalid tax scheme.\" Id., at 817.[2]\\nLike Michigan, Virginia exempted state and local employees' retirement benefits from state income taxation while taxing federal retirement benefits. Va. Code Ann. § 58.1 322(c)(3) (Supp. 1988). In response to Davis, Virginia repealed its exemption for state and local government employees. 1989 Va. Acts, Special Sess. II, ch. 3. It also enacted a special statute of limitations for refund claims made in light of Davis. Under this statute, taxpayers may seek a refund *91 of state taxes imposed on federal retirement benefits in 1985, 1986, 1987, and 1988 for up to one year from the date of the final judicial resolution of whether Virginia must refund these taxes. Va. Code Ann. § 58.1-1823(b) (Supp. 1992).[3]\\nPetitioners, 421 federal civil service and military retirees, sought a refund of taxes \"erroneously or improperly assessed\" in violation of Davis ` nondiscrimination principle.

Huson, supra, at 106-107,[4] the court reasoned that \"Davis decided an issue of first impression whose resolution was not clearly foreshadowed,\" that \"prospective application of Davis will not retard its operation,\" and that \"retroactive application would result in inequity, injustice and hardship.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 20a.\\nThe Supreme Court of Virginia affirmed. Harper v. Virginia Dept. of Taxation, 241 Va. 232, 401 S. E. 2d 868 (1991). It too concluded, after consulting Chevron and the plurality opinion in American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith, 496 U. S. 167 (1990), that \"the Davis decision is not to be applied retroactively.\" 241 Va., at 240, 401 S. E. 2d, at 873. The court also rejected petitioners' contention that \"refunds *92 [were] due as a matter of state law.\" Ibid. It concluded that \"because the Davis decision is not to be applied retroactively, the pre-Davis assessments were neither erroneous nor improper\" under Virginia's tax refund statute. Id., at 241, 401 S. E. 2d, at 873. As a matter of Virginia law, the court held, a \"ruling declaring a taxing scheme unconstitutional is to be applied prospectively only.\" Ibid. This rationale supplied \"another reason\" for refusing relief. Ibid. \\nEven as the Virginia courts were denying relief to petitioners, we were confronting a similar retroactivity problem in James B. Beam Distilling Co. v. Georgia, 501 U. S. 529 (1991). At issue was Bacchus Imports, Ltd. v. Dias, 468 U. S. 263 (1984), which prohibited States from imposing higher excise taxes on imported alcoholic beverages than on local products. The Supreme Court of Georgia had used the analysis described in Chevron Oil Co. v. Huson to deny retroactive effect to a decision of this Court. Six Members of this Court disagreed, concluding instead that Bacchus must be applied retroactively to claims arising from facts predating that decision. Beam, 501 U. S., at 532 (opinion of Souter, J.); id., at 544-545 (White, J., concurring in judgment); id., at 547-548 (Blackmun, J., concurring in judgment); id., at 548-549 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment). After deciding Beam, we vacated the judgment in Harper and remanded for further consideration. 501 U. S. 1247 (1991).\\nOn remand, the Supreme Court of Virginia again denied tax relief. 242 Va. 322, 410 S. E. 2d 629 (1991). It reasoned that because Michigan did not contest the Davis plaintiffs' entitlement to a refund, this Court \"made no . . . ruling\" regarding the retroactive application of its rule \"to the litigants in that case.\" 242 Va., at 326, 410 S. E. 2d, at 631. Concluding that Beam did not foreclose application of Chevron `s retroactivity analysis because \"the retroactivity issue was not decided in Davis, \" 242 Va., at 326, 410 S. E. 2d, at *93 631, the court \"reaffirm[ed] [its] prior decision in all respects,\" id., at 327, 410 S. E. 2d, at 632.\\nWhen we decided Davis, 23 States gave preferential tax treatment to benefits received by employees of state and local governments relative to the tax treatment of benefits received by federal employees.[5] Like the Supreme Court of Virginia, several other state courts have refused to accord full retroactive effect to Davis as a controlling statement of federal law.[6] Two of the courts refusing to apply Davis  retroactively have done so after this Court remanded for reconsideration in light of Beam. See Bass v. South Carolina, 501 U. S. 1246 (1991); Harper v. Virginia Dept. of Taxation, 501 U. S. 1247 (1991); Lewy v. Virginia Dept. of Taxation,  decided with Harper v. Virginia Dept. of Taxation, 501 U. S. 1247 (1991). By contrast, the Supreme Court of Arkansas has concluded as a matter of federal law that Davis applies retroactively. Pledger v. Bosnick, 306 Ark. 45, 54-56, 811 S. W. 2d 286, 292-293 (1991), cert. pending, No. 91-375. Cf. Reich v. Collins, 262 Ga. 625, 422 S. E. 2d 846 (1992) *94 (holding that Davis applies retroactively but reasoning that state law precluded a refund), cert. pending, Nos. 92-1276 and 92-1453.[7]\\nAfter the Supreme Court of Virginia reaffirmed its original decision, we granted certiorari a second time. 504 U. S. 907 (1992). We now reverse.\\n\\nII\\n\"[B]oth the common law and our own decisions\" have \"recognized a general rule of retrospective effect for the constitutional decisions of this Court.\" Robinson v. Neil, 409 U. S. 505, 507 (1973). Nothing in the Constitution alters the fundamental rule of \"retrospective operation\" that has governed \"[j]udicial decisions . . . for near a thousand years.\" Kuhn v. Fairmont Coal Co., 215 U. S. 349, 372 (1910) (Holmes, J., dissenting). In Linkletter v. Walker, 381 U. S. 618 (1965), however, we developed a doctrine under which we could deny retroactive effect to a newly announced rule of criminal law. Under Linkletter, a decision to confine a new rule to prospective application rested on the purpose of the new rule, the reliance placed upon the previous view of the law, and \"the effect on the administration of justice of a retrospective application\" of the new rule. Id., at 636 (limiting Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S. 643 (1961)).[8] In the civil context, we similarly permitted the denial of retroactive effect to \"a new principle of law\" if such a limitation would avoid \"`injustice or hardship'\" without unduly undermining the \"purpose *95 and effect\" of the new rule. Chevron Oil Co. v. Huson, 404 U. S., at 106-107 (quoting Cipriano v. City of Houma, 395 U. S. 701, 706 (1969)).[9]\\nWe subsequently overruled Linkletter in Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U. S. 314 (1987), and eliminated limits on retroactivity in the criminal context by holding that all \"newly declared . . . rule[s]\" must be applied retroactively to all \"criminal cases pending on direct review.\" Id., at 322. This holding rested on two \"basic norms of constitutional adjudication.\" Ibid. First, we reasoned that \"the nature of judicial review\" strips us of the quintessentially \"legislat[ive]\" prerogative to make rules of law retroactive or prospective as we see fit. Ibid. Second, we concluded that \"selective application of new rules violates the principle of treating similarly situated [parties] the same.\" Id., at 323.\\nDicta in Griffith, however, stated that \"civil retroactivity. . . . continue[d] to be governed by the standard announced in Chevron Oil. \" Id., at 322, n. 8. We divided over the meaning of this dicta in American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith, 496 U. S. 167 (1990). The four Justices in the plurality used \"the Chevron Oil test\" to consider whether to confine \"the application of [American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Scheiner, 483 U. S. 266 (1987),] to taxation of highway use prior to June 23, 1987, the date we decided Scheiner. \" Id., *96 at 179 (opinion of O'Connor, J., joined by Rehnquist, C. J., and White and Kennedy, JJ.). Four other Justices rejected the plurality's \"anomalous approach\" to retroactivity and declined to hold that \"the law applicable to a particular case is that law which the parties believe in good faith to be applicable to the case.\" Id., at 219 (Stevens, J., dissenting, joined by Brennan, Marshall, and Blackmun, JJ.). Finally, despite concurring in the judgment, Justice Scalia \"share[d]\" the dissent's \"perception that prospective decisionmaking is incompatible with the judicial role.\" Id., at 201.\\nGriffith and American Trucking thus left unresolved the precise extent to which the presumptively retroactive effect of this Court's decisions may be altered in civil cases. But we have since adopted a rule requiring the retroactive application of a civil decision such as Davis. Although James B. Beam Distilling Co. v. Georgia, 501 U. S. 529 (1991), did not produce a unified opinion for the Court, a majority of Justices agreed that a rule of federal law, once announced and applied to the parties to the controversy, must be given full retroactive effect by all courts adjudicating federal law. In announcing the judgment of the Court, Justice Souter laid down a rule for determining the retroactive effect of a civil decision: After the case announcing any rule of federal law has \"appl[ied] that rule with respect to the litigants\" before the court, no court may \"refuse to apply [that] rule . . . retroactively.\" Id., at 540 (opinion of Souter, J., joined by Stevens, J.). Justice Souter's view of retroactivity superseded \"any claim based on a Chevron Oil analysis.\" Ibid.  Justice White likewise concluded that a decision \"extending the benefit of the judgment\" to the winning party \"is to be applied to other litigants whose cases were not final at the time of the [first] decision.\" Id., at 544 (opinion concurring in judgment). Three other Justices agreed that \"our judicial responsibility . . . requir[es] retroactive application of each . . . rule we announce.\" Id., at 548 (Blackmun, J., *97 joined by Marshall and Scalia, JJ., concurring in judgment). See also id., at 548-549 (Scalia, J., joined by Marshall and Blackmun, JJ., concurring in judgment).\\nBeam controls this case, and we accordingly adopt a rule that fairly reflects the position of a majority of Justices in Beam: When this Court applies a rule of federal law to the parties before it, that rule is the controlling interpretation of federal law and must be given full retroactive effect in all cases still open on direct review and as to all events, regardless of whether such events predate or postdate our announcement of the rule. This rule extends Griffith `s ban against \"selective application of new rules.\" 479 U. S., at 323. Mindful of the \"basic norms of constitutional adjudication\" that animated our view of retroactivity in the criminal context, id., at 322, we now prohibit the erection of selective temporal barriers to the application of federal law in noncriminal cases. In both civil and criminal cases, we can scarcely permit \"the substantive law [to] shift and spring\" according to \"the particular equities of [individual parties'] claims\" of actual reliance on an old rule and of harm from a retroactive application of the new rule. Beam, supra, at 543 (opinion of Souter, J.). Our approach to retroactivity heeds the admonition that \"[t]he Court has no more constitutional authority in civil cases than in criminal cases to disregard current law or to treat similarly situated litigants differently.\" American Trucking, supra, at 214 (Stevens, J., dissenting).\\nThe Supreme Court of Virginia \"appl[ied] the threepronged Chevron Oil test in deciding the retroactivity issue\" presented by this litigation. 242 Va., at 326, 410 S. E. 2d, at 631. When this Court does not \"reserve the question whether its holding should be applied to the parties before it,\" however, an opinion announcing a rule of federal law \"is properly understood to have followed the normal rule of retroactive application\" and must be \"read to hold . . . that its rule should apply retroactively to the litigants then before *98 the Court.\" Beam, 501 U. S., at 539 (opinion of Souter, J.). Accord, id., at 544-545 (White, J., concurring in judgment); id., at 550 (O'Connor, J., dissenting). Furthermore, the legal imperative \"to apply a rule of federal law retroactively after the case announcing the rule has already done so\" must \"prevai[l] over any claim based on a Chevron Oil analysis.\" Id., at 540 (opinion of Souter, J.).\\nIn an effort to distinguish Davis, the Supreme Court of Virginia surmised that this Court had \"made no . . . ruling\" about the application of the rule announced in Davis \"retroactively to the litigants in that case.\" 242 Va., at 326, 410 S. E. 2d, at 631. \"[B]ecause the retroactivity issue was not decided in Davis, \" the court believed that it was \"not foreclosed by precedent from applying the three-pronged Chevron Oil test in deciding the retroactivity issue in the present case.\" Ibid. \\nWe disagree. Davis did not hold that preferential state tax treatment of state and local employee pensions, though constitutionally invalid in the future, should be upheld as to all events predating the announcement of Davis. The governmental appellee in Davis \"conceded that a refund [would have been] appropriate\" if we were to conclude that \"the Michigan Income Tax Act violate[d] principles of intergovernmental tax immunity by favoring retired state and local governmental employees over retired federal employees.\" 489 U. S., at 817. We stated that \"to the extent appellant has paid taxes pursuant to this invalid tax scheme, he is entitled to a refund.\" Ibid. Far from reserving the retroactivity question, our response to the appellee's concession constituted a retroactive application of the rule announced in Davis to the parties before the Court. Because a decision to accord solely prospective effect to Davis would have foreclosed any discussion of remedial issues, our \"consideration of remedial issues\" meant \"necessarily\" that we retroactively applied the rule we announced in Davis to the litigants before us. Beam, supra, at 539 (opinion of Souter, J.). *99 Therefore, under Griffith, Beam, and the retroactivity approach we adopt today, the Supreme Court of Virginia must apply Davis in petitioners' refund action.\\n\\nIII\\nRespondent Virginia Department of Taxation defends the judgment below as resting on an independent and adequate state ground that relieved the Supreme Court of Virginia of any obligation to apply Davis to events occurring before our announcement of that decision. Petitioners had contended that \"even if the Davis decision applie[d] prospectively only,\" they were entitled to relief under Virginia's tax refund statute, Va. Code Ann. § 58.1-1826 (1991). Harper v. Virginia Dept. of Taxation, 241 Va., at 241, 401 S. E. 2d, at 873. The Virginia court rejected their argument. It first reasoned that because Davis did not apply retroactively, tax assessments predating Davis were \"neither erroneous nor improper within the meaning\" of Virginia's tax statute. Ibid.  The court then offered \"another reason\" for rejecting petitioners' \"state-law contention\": \"We previously have held that this Court's ruling declaring a taxing scheme unconstitutional is to be applied prospectively only.\" Ibid. (citing Perkins v. Albemarle County, 214 Va. 240, 198 S. E. 2d 626, aff'd and modified on rehearing, 214 Va. 416, 200 S. E. 2d 566 (1973); Capehart v. City of Chesapeake, No. 5459 (Va. Cir. Ct., Oct. 16, 1974), appeal denied, 215 Va. xlvii, cert. denied, 423 U. S. 875 (1975)). The formulation of this state-law retroactivity doctrinethat \"consideration should be given to the purpose of the new rule, the extent of the reliance on the old rule, and the effect on the administration of justice of a retroactive application of the new rule,\" Fountain v. Fountain, 214 Va. 347, 348, 200 S. E. 2d 513, 514 (1973), cert. denied, 416 U. S. 939 (1974), quoted in 241 Va., at 241, 401 S. E. 2d, at 874suggests that the Supreme Court of Virginia has simply incorporated into state law the threepronged analysis of Chevron Oil, 404 U. S., at 106-107, and *100 the criminal retroactivity cases overruled by Griffith, see, e. g., Stovall v. Denno, 388 U. S. 293, 297 (1967).\\nWe reject the department's defense of the decision below. The Supremacy Clause, U. S. Const., Art. VI, cl. 2, does not allow federal retroactivity doctrine to be supplanted by the invocation of a contrary approach to retroactivity under state law. Whatever freedom state courts may enjoy to limit the retroactive operation of their own interpretations of state law, see Great Northern R. Co. v. Sunburst Oil & Refining Co., 287 U. S. 358, 364-366 (1932), cannot extend to their interpretations of federal law. See National Mines Corp. v. Caryl, 497 U. S. 922, 923 (1990) (per curiam); Ashland Oil, Inc. v. Caryl, 497 U. S. 916, 917 (1990) (per curiam). \\nWe also decline the Department of Taxation's invitation to affirm the judgment as resting on the independent and adequate ground that Virginia's law of remedies offered no \"retrospective refund remedy for taxable years concluded before Davis \" was announced. Brief for Respondent 33. The Virginia Supreme Court's conclusion that the challenged tax assessments were \"neither erroneous nor improper within the meaning\" of the refund statute rested solely on the court's determination that Davis did not apply retroactively. Harper v. Virginia Dept. of Taxation, supra, at 241, 401 S. E. 2d, at 873.\\nBecause we have decided that Davis applies retroactively to the tax years at issue in petitioners' refund action, we reverse the judgment below. We do not enter judgment for petitioners, however, because federal law does not necessarily entitle them to a refund. Rather, the Constitution requires Virginia \"to provide relief consistent with federal due process principles.\" American Trucking, 496 U. S., at 181 (plurality opinion). Under the Due Process Clause, U. S. Const., Amdt. 14, § 1, \"a State found to have imposed an impermissibly discriminatory tax retains flexibility in responding to this determination.\" McKesson Corp. v. Division of *101 Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco, Fla. Dept. of Business Regulation, 496 U. S. 18, 39-40 (1990). If Virginia \"offers a meaningful opportunity for taxpayers to withhold contested tax assessments and to challenge their validity in a predeprivation hearing,\" the \"availability of a predeprivation hearing constitutes a procedural safeguard . . . sufficient by itself to satisfy the Due Process Clause.\" Id., at 38, n. 21. On the other hand, if no such predeprivation remedy exists, \"the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment obligates the State to provide meaningful backward-looking relief to rectify any unconstitutional deprivation.\" Id. , at 31 (footnotes omitted).[10] In providing such relief, a State may either award full refunds to those burdened by an unlawful tax or issue some other order that \"create[s] in hindsight a nondiscriminatory scheme.\" Id., at 40. Cf. Davis, 489 U. S., at 818 (suggesting that a State's failure to respect intergovernmental tax immunity could be cured \"either by extending [a discriminatory] tax exemption to retired federal employees . . . or by eliminating the exemption for retired state and local government employees\").\\nThe constitutional sufficiency of any remedy thus turns (at least initially) on whether Virginia law \"provide[s] a[n] [adequate] form of `predeprivation process,' for example, by authorizing taxpayers to bring suit to enjoin imposition of a tax *102 prior to its payment, or by allowing taxpayers to withhold payment and then interpose their objections as defenses in a tax enforcement proceeding.\" McKesson, 496 U. S., at 3637. Because this issue has not been properly presented, we leave to Virginia courts this question of state law and the performance of other tasks pertaining to the crafting of any appropriate remedy. Virginia \"is free to choose which form of relief it will provide, so long as that relief satisfies the minimum federal requirements we have outlined.\" Id., at 51-52. State law may provide relief beyond the demands of federal due process, id., at 52, n. 36, but under no circumstances may it confine petitioners to a lesser remedy, see id.,  at 44-51.\\n\\nIV\\nWe reverse the judgment of the Supreme Court of Virginia, and we remand the case for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\\nSo ordered.\\nJustice Scalia, concurring.\\nI am surprised to see an appeal to stare decisis in today's dissent. In Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989), Justice O'Connor wrote for a plurality that openly rejected settled precedent controlling the scope of retroactivity on collateral review. \"This retroactivity determination,\" the opinion said, \"would normally entail application of the Linkletter [v. Walker, 381 U. S. 618 (1965),] standard, but we believe that our approach to retroactivity for cases on collateral review requires modification.\" Id., at 301. The dissent in Teague  was a sort of anticipatory echo of today's dissent, criticizing the plurality for displaying \"infidelity to the doctrine of stare decisis,\" id., at 331 (Brennan, J., dissenting), for \"upset[ting]. . . our time-honored precedents,\" id., at 333, for \"repudiating our familiar approach without regard for the doctrine of stare decisis,\" id., at 345, and for failing \"so much as [to] mention stare decisis,\" id., at 333.\\n*103 I joined the plurality opinion in Teague. Not only did I believe the rule it announced was correct, see Withrow v. Williams, 507 U. S. 680, 717 (1993) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part), but I also believed that abandonment of our prior collateral-review retroactivity rule was fully in accord with the doctrine of stare decisis, which as applied by our Court has never been inflexible. The Teague  plurality opinion set forth good reasons for abandoning Linkletter reasons justifying a similar abandonment of Chevron Oil Co. v. Huson, 404 U. S. 97 (1971). It noted, for example, that Linkletter \"ha[d] not led to consistent results,\" Teague, supra, at 302; but neither has Chevron Oil. Proof that what it means is in the eye of the beholder is provided quite nicely by the separate opinions filed today: Of the four Justices who would still apply Chevron Oil, two find Davis v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury, 489 U. S. 803 (1989), retroactive, see post,  at 111 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment), two find it not retroactive, see post, at 122 (O'Connor, J., dissenting). Second, the Teague plurality opinion noted that Linkletter had been criticized by commentators, Teague, supra, at 303; but the commentary cited in the opinion criticized not just Linkletter, but the Court's retroactivity jurisprudence in general, of which it considered Chevron Oil an integral part, see Beytagh, Ten Years of Non-Retroactivity: A Critique and a Proposal, 61 Va. L. Rev. 1557, 1558, 1581-1582, 1606 (1975). Other commentary, of course, has also regarded the issue of retroactivity as a general problem of jurisprudence. See, e. g., Fallon & Meltzer, New Law, Non-Retroactivity, and Constitutional Remedies, 104 Harv. L. Rev. 1731 (1991); Schaefer, Prospective Rulings: Two Perspectives, 1982 S. Ct. Rev. 1; Schaefer, The Control of \"Sunbursts\": Techniques of Prospective Overruling, 42 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 631 (1967); Mishkin, Forward: The High Court, The Great Writ, and the Due Process of Time and Law, 79 Harv. L. Rev. 56, 58-72 (1965).\\n*104 Finally, the plurality opinion in Teague justified the departure from Linkletter by implicitly relying on the well-settled proposition that stare decisis has less force where intervening decisions \"have removed or weakened the conceptual underpinnings from the prior decision.\" Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U. S. 164, 173 (1989). Justice O'Connor endorsed the reasoning expressed by Justice Harlan in his separate opinions in Mackey v. United States, 401 U. S. 667 (1971), and Desist v. United States, 394 U. S. 244 (1969), and noted that the Court had already adopted the first part of Justice Harlan's retroactivity views in Griffith  v. Kentucky, 479 U. S. 314 (1987). See Teague, supra, at 303-305. Again, this argument equallyindeed, even more forcefullysupports reconsideration of Chevron Oil. Griffith returned this Court, in criminal cases, to the traditional view (which I shall discuss at greater length below) that prospective decisionmaking \"violates basic norms of constitutional adjudication.\" Griffith, supra, at 322. One of the conceptual underpinnings of Chevron Oil was that retroactivity presents a similar problem in both civil and criminal contexts. See Chevron Oil, supra, at 106; see also Beytagh, supra, at 1606. Thus, after Griffith, Chevron Oil can be adhered to only by rejecting the reasoning of Chevron Oil  that is, only by asserting that the issue of retroactivity is different in the civil and criminal settings. That is a particularly difficult proof to make, inasmuch as Griffith rested on \"basic norms of constitutional adjudication\" and \"the nature of judicial review.\" 479 U. S., at 322; see also Teague, supra, at 317 (White, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (Griffith \"appear[s] to have constitutional underpinnings\").[1]\\n*105 What most provokes comment in the dissent, however, is not its insistence that today a rigid doctrine of stare decisis  forbids tinkering with retroactivity, which four Terms ago did not; but rather the irony of its invoking stare decisis in defense of prospective decisionmaking at all. Prospective decisionmaking is the handmaid of judicial activism, and the born enemy of stare decisis. It was formulated in the heyday of legal realism and promoted as a \"techniqu[e] of judicial lawmaking\" in general, and more specifically as a means of making it easier to overrule prior precedent. B. Levy, Realist Jurisprudence and Prospective Overruling, *106 109 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1 (1960). Thus, the dissent is saying, in effect, that stare decisis demands the preservation of methods of destroying stare decisis recently invented in violation of stare decisis. \\nContrary to the dissent's assertion that Chevron Oil articulated \"our traditional retroactivity analysis,\" post, at 113, the jurisprudence it reflects \"came into being,\" as Justice Harlan observed, less than 30 years ago with Linkletter v. Walker, 381 U. S. 618 (1965). Mackey, supra, at 676. It is so unancient that one of the current Members of this Court was sitting when it was invented. The true traditional  view is that prospective decisionmaking is quite incompatible with the judicial power, and that courts have no authority to engage in the practice. See ante, at 94; James B. Beam Distilling Co. v. Georgia, 501 U. S. 529, 534 (1991) (opinion of Souter, J.); American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith, 496 U. S. 167, 201 (1990) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment); Desist, supra, at 258-259 (Harlan, J., dissenting); Great Northern R. Co. v. Sunburst Oil & Refining Co., 287 U. S. 358, 365 (1932). Linkletter itself recognized that \"[a]t common law there was no authority for the proposition that judicial decisions made law only for the future.\" 381 U. S., at 622-623. And before Linkletter, the academic proponents of prospective judicial decisionmaking acknowledged that their proposal contradicted traditional practice. See, e. g.,  Levy, supra, at 2, and n. 2; Carpenter, Court Decisions and the Common Law, 17 Colum. L. Rev. 593, 594 (1917). Indeed, the roots of the  contrary tradition are so deep that Justice Holmes was prepared to hazard the guess that \"[j]udicial decisions have had retrospective operation for near a thousand years.\" Kuhn v. Fairmont Coal Co., 215 U. S. 349, 372 (1910) (dissenting opinion).\\nJustice O'Connor asserts that \"`[w]hen the Court changes its mind, the law changes with it.' \" Post, at 115 (quoting Beam, supra, at 550 (O'Connor, J., dissenting)). That concept is quite foreign to the American legal and constitutional *107 tradition. It would have struck John Marshall as an extraordinary assertion of raw power. The conception of the judicial role that he possessed, and that was shared by succeeding generations of American judges until very recent times, took it to be \"the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is, \" Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 177 (1803) (emphasis added)not what the law shall be. That original and enduring American perception of the judicial role sprang not from the philosophy of Nietzsche but from the jurisprudence of Blackstone, which viewed retroactivity as an inherent characteristic of the judicial power, a power \"not delegated to pronounce a new law, but to maintain and expound the old one.\" 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries 69 (1765). Even when a \"former determination is most evidently contrary to reason . . . [or] contrary to the divine law,\" a judge overruling that decision would \"not pretend to make a new law, but to vindicate the old one from misrepresentation.\" Id., at 69-70. \"For if it be found that the former decision is manifestly absurd or unjust, it is declared, not that such a sentence was bad law, but that it was not law. \" Id., at 70 (emphases in original). Fully retroactive decisionmaking was considered a principal distinction between the judicial and the legislative power: \"[I]t is said that that which distinguishes a judicial from a legislative act is, that the one is a determination of what the existing law is in relation to some existing thing already done or happened, while the other is a predetermination of what the law shall be for the regulation of all future cases.\" T. Cooley, Constitutional Limitations *91. The critics of the traditional rule of full retroactivity were well aware that it was grounded in what one of them contemptuously called \"another fiction known as the Separation of powers.\" Kocourek, Retrospective Decisions and Stare Decisis and a Proposal, 17 A. B. A. J. 180, 181 (1931).\\nProspective decisionmaking was known to foe and friend alike as a practical tool of judicial activism, born out of disregard *108 for stare decisis. In the eyes of its enemies, the doctrine \"smack[ed] of the legislative process,\" Mishkin, 79 Harv. L. Rev., at 65, \"encroach[ed] on the prerogatives of the legislative department of government,\" Von Moschzisker, Stare Decisis in Courts of Last Resort, 37 Harv. L. Rev. 409, 428 (1924), removed \"one of the great inherent restraints upon this Court's depart[ing] from the field of interpretation to enter that of lawmaking,\" James v. United States, 366 U. S. 213, 225 (1961) (Black, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part), caused the Court's behavior to become \"assimilated to that of a legislature,\" Kurland, Toward a Political Supreme Court, 37 U. Chi. L. Rev. 19, 34 (1969), and tended \"to cut [the courts] loose from the force of precedent, allowing [them] to restructure artificially those expectations legitimately created by extant law and thereby mitigate the practical force of stare decisis, \" Mackey, 401 U. S., at 680 (Harlan, J., concurring in judgment). All this was not denied by the doctrine's friends, who also viewed it as a device to \"augmen[t] the power of the courts to contribute to the growth of the law in keeping with the demands of society,\" Mallamud, Prospective Limitation and the Rights of the Accused, 56 Iowa L. Rev. 321, 359 (1970), as \"a deliberate and conscious technique of judicial lawmaking,\" Levy, 109 U. Pa. L. Rev., at 6, as a means of \"facilitating more effective and defensible judicial lawmaking,\" id., at 28.\\nJustice Harlan described this Court's embrace of the prospectivity principle as \"the product of the Court's disquietude with the impacts of its fast-moving pace of constitutional innovation,\" Mackey, supra, at 676. The Court itself, however, glowingly described the doctrine as the cause rather than the effect of innovation, extolling it as a \"technique\" providing the \"impetus . . . for the implementation of long overdue reforms.\" Jenkins v. Delaware, 395 U. S. 213, 218 (1969). Whether cause or effect, there is no doubt that the era which gave birth to the prospectivity principle was marked by a newfound disregard for stare decisis. As one *109 commentator calculated, \"[b]y 1959, the number of instances in which the Court had reversals involving constitutional issues had grown to sixty; in the two decades which followed, the Court overruled constitutional cases on no less than forty-seven occasions.\" Maltz, Some Thoughts on the Death of Stare Decisis in Constitutional Law, 1980 Wis. L. Rev. 467. It was an era when this Court cast overboard numerous settled decisions, and indeed even whole areas of law, with an unceremonious \"heave-ho.\" See, e. g., Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S. 643 (1961) (overruling Wolf v. Colorado, 338 U. S. 25 (1949)); Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335 (1963) (overruling Betts v. Brady, 316 U. S. 455 (1942)); Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, 479, n. 48 (1966) (overruling Crooker v. California, 357 U. S. 433 (1958), and Cicenia v. Lagay, 357 U. S. 504 (1958)); Katz v. United States, 389 U. S. 347 (1967) (overruling Olmstead v. United States, 277 U. S. 438 (1928), and Goldman v. United States, 316 U. S. 129 (1942)). To argue now that one of the jurisprudential tools of judicial activism from that period should be extended on grounds of stare decisis  can only be described as paradoxical.[2]\\nIn sum, I join the opinion of the Court because the doctrine of prospective decisionmaking is not in fact protected *110 by our flexible rule of stare decisis; and because no friend of stare decisis would want it to be.\\nJustice Kennedy, with whom Justice White joins, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.\\nI remain of the view that it is sometimes appropriate in the civil context to give only prospective application to a judicial decision. \"[P]rospective overruling allows courts to respect the principle of stare decisis even when they are impelled to change the law in light of new understanding.\" American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith, 496 U. S. 167, 197 (1990) (plurality opinion). When a court promulgates a new rule of law, prospective application functions \"to avoid injustice or hardship to civil litigants who have justifiably relied on prior law.\" Id., at 199 (internal quotation marks omitted). See Phoenix v. Kolodziejski, 399 U. S. 204, 213-215 (1970); Cipriano v. City of Houma, 395 U. S. 701, 706 (1969) (per curiam); England v. Louisiana Bd. of Medical Examiners, 375 U. S. 411, 422 (1964). And in my view retroactivity in civil cases continues to be governed by the standard announced in Chevron Oil Co. v. Huson, 404 U. S. 97, 106-107 (1971). Thus, for the reasons explained by Justice O'Connor, post, at 113-117, I cannot agree with the Court's broad dicta, ante, at 95-97, that appears to embrace in the civil context the retroactivity principles adopted for criminal cases in Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U. S. 314 (1987). As Justice O'Connor has demonstrated elsewhere, the differences between the civil and criminal contexts counsel strongly against adoption of Griffith for civil cases. See American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith, supra, at 197-199. I also cannot accept the Court's conclusion, ante, at 96-99, which is based on Justice Souter's opinion in James B. Beam Distilling Co. v. Georgia, 501 U. S. 529, 540-543 (1991), that a decision of this Court must be applied in a retroactive manner simply because the rule of law there announced happened to be applied to the parties then before the Court. *111 See post, at 117-122 (O'Connor, J.,dissenting); James B. Beam Distilling Co. v. Georgia, supra, at 550-552 (O'Connor, J., dissenting). For these reasons, I do not join Part II of the Court's opinion.\\nI nonetheless agree with the Court that Davis v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury, 489 U. S. 803 (1989), must be given retroactive effect. The first condition for prospective application of any decision is that itmust announce a new rule of law. Ashland Oil, Inc. v. Caryl, 497 U. S. 916, 918 (1990) (per curiam); American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith, supra,  at 179; United States v. Johnson, 457 U. S. 537, 550, n. 12 (1982); Chevron Oil Co. v. Huson, 404 U. S., at 106-107. The decision must \"overrul[e] clear past precedent on which litigants may have relied\" or \"decid[e] an issue of first impression whose resolution was not clearly foreshadowed.\" Id. , at 106. Because Davis did neither, it did not announce new law and therefore must be applied in a retroactive manner.\\nRespondent argues that two new principles of law were established in Davis. First, it points to the holding that 4 U. S. C. § 111, in which the United States consents to state taxation of the compensation of \"an officer or employee of the United States,\" applies to federal retirees as well as current federal employees. Brief for Respondent 16-18. See Davis, 489 U. S., at 808-810. In Davis, however, we indicated that this holding was \"dictate[d]\" by \"the plain language of the statute,\" id., at 808, and we added for good measure our view that the language of the statute was \"unambiguous,\" \"unmistakable,\" and \"leaves no room for doubt,\" id., at 809, n. 3, 810. Given these characterizations, it is quite implausible to contend that in this regard Davis  decided \"an issue of first impression whose resolution was not clearly foreshadowed.\" Chevron Oil, supra, at 106.\\nThe second new rule respondent contends the Court announced in Davis was that the state statute at issue discriminated against federal retirees even though the statute treated them like all other state taxpayers except state employees. *112 Brief for Respondent 18-26. See Davis, supra, at 814, 815, n. 4. The Davis Court, however, anchored its decision in precedent. We observed that in Phillips Chemical Co. v. Dumas Independent School Dist., 361 U. S. 376 (1960), \"we faced th[e] precise situation\" confronting us in Davis,  and so Phillips Chemical controlled our holding. 489 U. S., at 815, n. 4. To be sure, Justice Stevens in dissent disagreed with these contentions and attempted to distinguish Phillips Chemical. 489 U. S., at 824-826. The Court, however, was not persuaded at the time, and I remain convinced that the Court had the better reading of Phillips Chemical.  A contrary holding in Davis, in my view, would have created a clear inconsistency in our jurisprudence. Under Chevron Oil, application of precedent which directly controls is not the stuff of which new law is made.\\nFar from being \"revolutionary,\" Ashland Oil Co. v. Caryl, supra, at 920, or \"an avulsive change which caused the current of the law thereafter to flow between new banks,\" Hanover Shoe, Inc. v. United Shoe Machinery Co., 392 U. S. 481, 499 (1968), Davis was a mere application of plain statutory language and existing precedent. In these circumstances, this Court is not free to mitigate any financial hardship that might befall Virginia's taxpayers as a result of their state government's failure to reach a correct understanding of the unambiguous dictates of federal law.\\nBecause I do not believe that Davis v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury, supra, announced a new principle of law, I have no occasion to consider Justice O'Connor's argument, post,  at 131-136, that equitable considerations may inform the formulation of remedies when a new rule is announced. In any event, I do not read Part III of the Court's opinion as saying anything inconsistent with what Justice O'Connor proposes.\\nOn this understanding, I join Parts I and III of the Court's opinion and concur in its judgment.\\n*113 Justice O'Connor, with whom The Chief Justice joins, dissenting.\\nToday the Court applies a new rule of retroactivity to impose crushing and unnecessary liability on the States, precisely at a time when they can least afford it. Were the Court's decision the product of statutory or constitutional command, I would have no choice but to join it. But nothing in the Constitution or statute requires us to adopt the retroactivity rule the majority now applies. In fact, longstanding precedent requires the opposite result. Because I see no reason to abandon our traditional retroactivity analysis as articulated in Chevron Oil Co. v. Huson, 404 U. S. 97, 106 107 (1971), and because I believe the Supreme Court of Virginia correctly applied Chevron Oil in this case, I would affirm the judgment below.\\n\\nI\\nThis Court's retroactivity jurisprudence has become somewhat chaotic in recent years. Three Terms ago, the case of American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith, 496 U. S. 167 (1990), produced three opinions, none of which garnered a majority. One Term later, James B. Beam Distilling Co. v. Georgia, 501 U. S. 529 (1991), yielded five opinions; there, no single writing carried more than three votes. As a result, the Court today finds itself confronted with such disarray that, rather than relying on precedent, it must resort to vote counting: Examining the various opinions in Jim Beam, it discerns six votes for a single proposition that, in its view, controls this case. Ante, at 96-97.\\nIf we had given appropriate weight to the principle of stare decisis in the first place, our retroactivity jurisprudence never would have become so hopelessly muddled. After all, it was not that long ago that the law of retroactivity for civil cases was considered well settled. In Chevron Oil Co. , we explained that whether a decision will be nonretroactive depends on whether it announces a new rule, whether prospectivity would undermine the purposes of the *114 rule, and whether retroactive application would produce injustice. 404 U. S., at 106-107. Even when this Court adjusted the retroactivity rule for criminal cases on direct review some six years ago, we reaffirmed the vitality of Chevron Oil, noting that retroactivity in civil cases \"continues to be governed by the standard announced in Chevron Oil Co. v. Huson. \" Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U. S. 314, 322, n. 8 (1987). In American Trucking Assns., supra, however, a number of Justices expressed a contrary view, and the jurisprudential equivalent of entropy immediately took over. Whatever the merits of any retroactivity test, it cannot be denied that resolution of the case before us would be simplified greatly had we not disregarded so needlessly our obligation to follow precedent in the first place.\\nI fear that the Court today, rather than rectifying that confusion, reinforces it still more. In the usual case, of course, retroactivity is not an issue; the courts simply apply their best understanding of current law in resolving each case that comes before them. James B. Beam, 501 U. S., at 534, 535-536 (Souter, J.). But where the law changes in some respect, the courts sometimes may elect not to apply the new law; instead, they apply the law that governed when the events giving rise to the suit took place, especially where the change in law is abrupt and the parties may have relied on the prior law. See id., at 534. This can be done in one of two ways. First, a court may choose to make the decision purely prospective, refusing to apply it not only to the parties before the court but also to any case where the relevant facts predate the decision. Id., at 536. Second, a court may apply the rule to some but not all cases where the operative events occurred before the court's decision, depending on the equities. See id., at 537. The first option is called \"pure prospectivity\" and the second \"selective prospectivity.\"\\nAs the majority notes, ante, at 96-97, six Justices in James B. Beam, supra, expressed their disagreement with selective prospectivity. Thus, even though there was no majority *115 opinion in that case, one can derive from that case the proposition the Court announces today: Once \"this Court applies a rule of federal law to the parties before it,that rule .. . must be given full retroactive effect in all cases still open on direct review.\" Ante, at 97. But no decision of this Court forecloses the possibility of pure prospectivityrefusal to apply a new rule in the very case in which it is announced and every case thereafter. As Justice White explained in his concurrence in James B. Beam, \"[t]he propriety of prospective application of decision in this Court, in both constitutional and statutory cases, is settled by our prior decisions.\" 501 U. S., at 546 (opinion concurring in judgment).\\nRather than limiting its pronouncements to the question of selective prospectivity, the Court intimates that pure prospectivity may be prohibited as well. See ante, at 97 (referring to our lack of \"`constitutional authority . . . to disregard current law' \"); ibid. (relying on \"`basic norms of constitutional adjudication' \" (quoting Griffith, supra, at 322)); see also ante, at 94 (touting the \"fundamental rule of `retrospective operation' \" of judicial decisions). The intimation is incorrect. As I have explained before and will touch upon only briefly here:\\n\"[W]hen the Court changes its mind, the law changes with it. If the Court decides, in the context of a civil case or controversy, to change the law, it must make [a] determination whether the new law or the old is to apply to conduct occurring before the law-changing decision. Chevron Oil describes our long-established procedure for making this inquiry.\" James B. Beam, supra, at 550 (O'Connor, J., dissenting) (internal quotation marks omitted).\\nNor can the Court's suggestion be squared with our cases, which repeatedly have announced rules of purely prospective effect. See, e. g., Northern Pipeline Constr. Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co., 458 U. S. 50, 88 (1982); Chevron Oil, 404 *116 U. S., at 106-107; Phoenix v. Kolodziejski, 399 U. S. 204, 214 (1970); Cipriano v. City of Houma, 395 U. S. 701, 706 (1969); see also American Trucking Assns., 496 U. S., at 188-200 (plurality opinion) (canvassing the Court's retroactivity jurisprudence); ante, at 110 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (citing cases).\\nIn any event, the question of pure prospectivity is not implicated here. The majority first holds that once a rule has been applied retroactively, the rule must be applied retroactively to all cases thereafter. Ante, at 97. Then it holds that Davis v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury, 489 U. S. 803 (1989), in fact retroactively applied the rule it announced. Ante, at 98-99. Under the majority's approach, that should end the matter: Because the Court applied the rule retroactively in Davis, it must do so here as well. Accordingly, there is no reason for the Court's careless dictum regarding pure prospectivity, much less dictum that is contrary to clear precedent.\\nPlainly enough, Justice Scalia would cast overboard our entire retroactivity doctrine with precisely the \"unceremonious `heave-ho' \" he decries in his concurrence. See ante, at 109. Behind the undisguised hostility to an era whose jurisprudence he finds distasteful, Justice Scalia raises but two substantive arguments, both of which were raised in James B. Beam , 501 U. S., at 549 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment), and neither of which has been adopted by a majority of this Court. Justice White appropriately responded to those arguments then, see id., at 546 (opinion concurring in judgment), and there is no reason to repeat the responses now. As Justice Frankfurter explained more than 35 years ago:\\n\"We should not indulge in the fiction that the law now announced has always been the law . . . . It is much more conducive to law's self-respect to recognize candidly the considerations that give prospective content to *117 a new pronouncement of law.\" Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U. S. 12, 26 (1956) (opinion concurring in judgment).\\n\\nII\\nI dissented in James B. Beam because I believed that the absolute prohibition on selective prospectivity was not only contrary to precedent, but also so rigid that it produced unconscionable results. I would have adhered to the traditional equitable balancing test of Chevron Oil as the appropriate method of deciding the retroactivity question in individual cases. But even if one believes the prohibition on selective prospectivity desirable, it seems to me that the Court today takes that judgment to an illogicaland inequitableextreme. It is one thing to say that, where we have considered prospectivity in a prior case and rejected it, we must reject it in every case thereafter. But it is quite another to hold that, because we did not consider the possibility of prospectivity in a prior case and instead applied a rule retroactively through inadvertence, we are foreclosed from considering the issue forever thereafter. Such a rule is both contrary to established precedent and at odds with any notion of fairness or sound decisional practice. Yet that is precisely the rule the Court appears to adopt today. Ante, at 96-97.\\n\\nA\\nUnder the Court's new approach, we have neither authority nor discretion to consider the merits of applying Davis v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury, supra, retroactively. Instead, we must inquire whether any of our previous decisions happened to have applied the Davis rule retroactively to the parties before the Court. Deciding whether we in fact have applied Davis retroactively turns out to be a rather difficult matter. Parsing the language of the Davis opinion, the Court encounters a single sentence it declares determinative: \"The State having conceded that a refund is appropriate in *118 these circumstances, see Brief for Appellee 63, to the extent appellant has paid taxes pursuant to this invalid tax scheme, he is entitled to a refund.\" Id., at 817 (quoted in part, ante,  at 98). According to the majority, that sentence constitutes \"`consideration of remedial issues' \" and therefore \"`necessarily' \" indicates that we applied the rule in Davis retroactively to the parties before us. Ante, at 98 (quoting James B. Beam, supra, at 539 (opinion of Souter, J.)). Ironically, respondent and its amici draw precisely the opposite conclusion from the same sentence. According to them, the fact that Michigan conceded that it would offer relief meant that we had no reason to decide the question of retroactivity in Davis. Michigan was willing to provide relief whether or not relief was required. The Court simply accepted that offer and preserved the retroactivity question for another day.\\nOne might very well debate the meaning of the single sentence on which everyone relies. But the debate is as meaningless as it is indeterminate. In Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U. S. 619 (1993), we reaffirmed our longstanding rule that, if a decision does not \"squarely addres[s] [an] issue,\" this Court remains \"free to address [it] on the merits\" at a later date. Id., at 631. Accord, United States v. L. A. Tucker Truck Lines, Inc., 344 U. S. 33, 38 (1952) (issue not \"raised in briefs or argument nor discussed in the opinion of the Court\" cannot be taken as \"a binding precedent on th[e] point\"); Webster v. Fall, 266 U. S. 507, 511 (1925) (\"Questions which merely lurk in the record, neither brought to the attention of the court nor ruled upon, are not considered as having been so decided as to constitute precedents\"). The rule can be traced back to some of the earliest of this Court's decisions. See statement of Marshall, C. J.,as reported in the arguments of counsel in United States v. More, 3 Cranch 159, 172 (1805) (\"No question was made, in that case, as to the jurisdiction. It passed sub silentio, and the court does not consider itself as bound by that case\"). Regardless of *119 how one reads the solitary sentence upon which the Court relies, surely it does not \"squarely address\" the question of retroactivity; it does not even mention retroactivity. At best, by addressing the question of remedies, the sentence implicitly \"assumes\" the rule in Davis to be retroactive. Our decision in Brecht, however, makes it quite clear that unexamined assumptions do not bind this Court. Brecht, supra, at 631 (That the Court \"assumed the applicability of\" a rule does not bind the Court to the assumption).\\nIn fact, there is far less reason to consider ourselves bound by precedent today than there was in Brecht. In Brecht,  the issue was not whether a legal question was resolved by a single case; it was whether our consistent practice of applying a particular rule, Chapman v. California, 386 U. S. 18, 24 (1967), to cases on collateral review precluded us from limiting the rule's application to cases on direct review. Because none of our prior cases directly had addressed the applicability of Chapman to cases on collateral revieweach had only assumed it appliedthe Court held that those cases did not bind us to any particular result. See Brecht, supra,  at 630-631. I see no reason why a single retroactive application of the Davis rule, inferred from the sparse and ambiguous language of Davis itself, should carry more weight here than our consistent practice did in Brecht. \\nThe Court offers no justification for disregarding the settled rule we so recently applied in Brecht. Nor do I believe it could, for the rule is not a procedural nicety. On the contrary, it is critical to the soundness of our decisional processes. It should go without saying that any decision of this Court has wide-ranging applications; nearly every opinion we issue has effects far beyond the particular case in which it issues. The rule we applied in Brecht, which limits the stare decisis effect of our decisions to questions actually considered and passed on, ensures that this Court does not decide important questions by accident or inadvertence. By adopting a contrary rule in the area of retroactivity, the *120 Court now permanently binds itself to its every unexamined assumption or inattention. Any rule that creates a grave risk that we might resolve important issues of national concern sub silentio, without thought or consideration, cannot be a wise one.\\nThis case demonstrates the danger of such a rule. The question of retroactivity was never briefed in Davis. It had not been passed upon by the court below. And it was not within the question presented. Indeed, at oral argument we signaled that we would not pass upon the retroactivity of the rule Davis would announce. After conceding that the Michigan Department of Taxation would give Davis himself a refund if he prevailed, counsel for the department argued that it would be unfair to require Michigan to provide refunds to the 24,000 taxpayers who were not before the Court. The following colloquy ensued:\\n\"[Court]: So why do we have to answer that at all? \"[Michigan]: if, if this Court issues an opinion stating that the current Michigan classification is unconstitutional or in violation of the statute, there are these 24,000 taxpayers out there.. . . . .\\n\"[Court]: But that's notit's not here, is it? Is that question here?\\n\"[Michigan]: It is not specifically raised, no.\" Tr. of Oral Arg., O. T. 1988, No. 87-1020, pp. 37-38.\\nNow, however, the Court holds that the question was implicitly before us and that, even though the Davis opinion does not even discuss the question of retroactivity, it resolved the issue conclusively and irretrievably.\\nIf Davis somehow did decide that its rule was to be retroactive, it was by chance and not by design. The absence of briefing, argument, or even mention of the question belies any suggestion that the issue was given thoughtful consideration. Even the author of the Davis opinion refuses to accept *121 the notion that Davis resolved the question of retroactivity. Instead, Justice Kennedy applies the analysis of Chevron Oil to resolve the retroactivity question today. See ante, at 110-112 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment).\\nThe Court's decision today cannot be justified by comparison to our decision in Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U. S. 314 (1987), which abandoned selective prospectivity in the criminal context. Ante, at 97. As I explained in American Trucking Assns., 496 U. S., at 197-200, there are significant differences between criminal and civil cases that weigh against such an extension. First, nonretroactivity in criminal cases historically has favored the government's reliance interests over the rights of criminal defendants. As a result, the generalized policy of favoring individual rights over governmental prerogative can justify the elimination of prospectivity in the criminal arena. The same rationale cannot apply in civil cases, as nonretroactivity in the civil context does not necessarily favor plaintiffs or defendants; \"nor is there any policy reason for protecting one class of litigants over another.\" Id., at 198. More important, even a party to civil litigation who is \"deprived of the full retroactive benefit of a new decision may receive some relief.\" Id., at 198 199. Here, for example, petitioners received the benefit of prospective invalidation of Virginia's taxing scheme. From this moment forward, they will be treated on an equal basis with all other retirees, the very treatment our intergovernmental immunity cases require. The criminal defendant, in contrast, is usually interested only in one remedyreversal of his conviction. That remedy can be obtained only if the rule is applied retroactively. See id. , at 199.\\nNor can the Court's rejection of selective retroactivity in the civil context be defended on equal treatment grounds. See Griffith, supra, at 323 (selective retroactivity accords a benefit to the defendant in whose case the decision is announced but not to any defendant thereafter). It may well *122 be that there is little difference between the criminal defendant in whose case a decision is announced and the defendant who seeks certiorari on the same question two days later. But in this case there is a tremendous difference between the defendant in whose case the Davis rule was announced and the defendant who appears before us today: The latter litigated and preserved the retroactivity question while the former did not. The Michigan Department of Taxation did not even brief the question of retroactivity in Davis. Respondent, in contrast, actually prevailed on the question in the court below.\\nIf the Court is concerned with equal treatment, that difference should be dispositive. Having failed to demand the unusual, prospectivity, respondent in Davis got the usual namely, retroactivity. Respondent in this case has asked for the unusual. In fact, respondent here defends a judgment below that awarded it just that. I do not see how the principles of equality can support forcing the Commonwealth of Virginia to bear the harsh consequences of retroactivity simply because, years ago, the Michigan Department of Taxation failed to press the issueand we neglected to consider it. Instead, the principles of fairness favor addressing the contentions the Virginia Department of Taxation presses before us by applying Chevron Oil today. It is therefore to Chevron Oil that I now turn.\\n\\nB\\nUnder Chevron Oil, whether a decision of this Court will be applied nonretroactively depends on three factors. First, as a threshold matter, \"the decision to be applied nonretroactively must establish a new principle of law.\" 404 U. S., at 106. Second, nonretroactivity must not retard the new rule's operation in light of its history, purpose, and effect. Id., at 107. Third, nonretroactivity must be necessary to avoid the substantial injustice and hardship that a holding of retroactivity might impose. Ibid. In my view, all three factors favor holding our decision in Davis nonretroactive.\\n\\n\\n*123 1\\nAs Justice Kennedy points out in his concurrence, ante,  at 111, a decision cannot be made nonretroactive unless it announces \"a new principle of law.\" Chevron Oil, 404 U. S., at 106. For purposes of civil retroactivity, Chevron Oil  identifies two types of decisions that can be new. First, a decision is new if it overturns \"clear past precedent on which litigants may have relied.\" Ibid.; ante, at 111 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). I agree with Justice Kennedy that Davis did not represent such a \"`revolutionary' \" or \"`avulsive change' \" in the law. Ante,  at 112 (quoting Hanover Shoe, Inc. v. United Shoe Machinery Corp., 392 U. S. 481, 499 (1968)).\\nNonetheless, Chevron also explains that a decision may be \"new\" if it resolves \"an issue of first impression whose resolution was not clearly foreshadowed.\" Chevron Oil, supra,  at 106 (emphasis added). Thus, even a decision that is \"controlled by the . . . principles\" articulated in precedent may announce a new rule, so long as the rule was \"sufficiently debatable\" in advance. Arizona Governing Comm. for Tax Deferred Annuity and Deferred Compensation Plans v. Norris, 463 U. S. 1073, 1109 (1983) (O'Connor, J., concurring). Reading the Davis opinion alone, one might get the impression that it did not announce a new rule even of that variety. The opinion's emphatic language suggests that the outcome was not even debatable. See ante, at 111 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). In my view, however, assertive language is not itself determinative. As The Chief Justice explained for the Court in a different context:\\n\"[T]he fact that a court says that its decision . . . is `controlled' by a prior decision, is not conclusive for purposes of deciding whether the current decision is a `new rule' . . . . Courts frequently view their decisions as being `controlled' or `governed' by prior opinions even *124 when aware of reasonable contrary conclusions reached by other courts.\" Butler v. McKellar, 494 U. S. 407, 415 (1990).\\nIn Butler, we determined that the rule announced in Arizona v. Roberson, 486 U. S. 675 (1988), was \"new\" for purposes of Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989), despite Roberson `s repeated assertions that its rule was \"directly controlled\" by precedent. Indeed, we did not even feel bound by the opinion's statement that it was not announcing a new rule at all but rather declining to create an exception to an existing rule. While Teague and its progeny may not provide the appropriate standard of novelty for Chevron Oil  purposes, their teachingthat whether an opinion is new depends not on its language or tone but on the legal landscape from which it aroseobtains nonetheless.\\nIn any event, Justice Stevens certainly thought that Davis announced a new rule. In fact, he thought that the rule was not only unprecedented, but wrong: \"The Court's holding is not supported by the rationale for the intergovernmental immunity doctrine and is not compelled by our previous decisions. I cannot join the unjustified, court-imposed restriction on a State's power to administer its own affairs.\" 489 U. S., at 818-819 (dissenting opinion). And just last Term two Members of this Court expressed their disagreement with the decision in Davis, labeling its application of the doctrine of intergovernmental immunity \"perverse.\" Barker v. Kansas, 503 U. S. 594, 606 (1992) (Stevens, J., joined by Thomas, J., concurring). Although I would not call our decision in Davis perverse, I agree that its rule was sufficiently debatable in advance as to fall short of being \"clearly foreshadowed.\" The great weight of authority is in accord.[*]\\n*125 In fact, before Davis was announced, conventional wisdom seemed to be directly to the contrary. One would think that, if Davis was \"clearly foreshadowed,\" some taxpayer might have made the intergovernmental immunity argument before. No one had. Twenty-three States had taxation schemes just like the one at issue in Davis; and some of those schemes were established as much as half a century before Davis was decided. See Harper v. Virginia Dept. of Taxation, 241 Va. 232, 237, 401 S. E. 2d 868, 871 (1991). Yet not a single taxpayer ever challenged one of those schemes on intergovernmental immunity grounds until Davis challenged Michigan's in 1984. If Justice Holmes is correct that \"[t]he prophecies of what the courts will do in fact, and nothing more pretentious\" are \"law,\" O. Holmes, The Path of the Law, in Collected Legal Papers 167, 173 (1920), then surely Davis announced new law; the universal \"prophecy\" before Davis seemed to be that such taxation schemes were valid.\\nAn examination of the decision in Davis and its predecessors reveals that Davis was anything but clearly foreshadowed. Of course, it was well established long before Davis  that the nondiscrimination principle of 4 U. S. C. § 111 and the doctrine of intergovernmental immunity prohibit a State from imposing a discriminatory tax on the United States or *126 those who do business with it. The income tax at issue in Davis, however, did not appear discriminatory on its face. Like the Virginia income tax at issue here, it did not single out federal employees or retirees for disfavored treatment. Instead, federal retirees were treated identically to all other retirees, with a single and numerically insignificant exceptionretirees whose retirement benefits were paid by the State. Whether such an exception rendered the tax \"discriminatory\" within the meaning of the intergovernmental immunity doctrine, it seems to me, was an open question. On the one hand, the tax scheme did distinguish between federal retirees and state retirees: The former were required to pay state taxes on their retirement income, while the latter were not. But it was far from clear that such was the proper comparison. In fact, there were strong arguments that it was not.\\nAs Justice Stevens explained more thoroughly in his Davis dissent, 489 U. S., at 819and as we have recognized since McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316 (1819)intergovernmental immunity is necessary to prevent the States from interfering with federal interests through taxation. Because the National Government has no recourse to the state ballot box, it has only a limited ability to protect itself against excessive state taxes. But the risk of excessive taxation of federal interests is eliminated, and \"[a] `political check' is provided, when a state tax falls\" not only on the Federal Government, but also \"on a significant group of state citizens who can be counted upon to use their votes to keep the State from raising the tax excessively, and thus placing an unfair burden on the Federal Government.\"\\nWashington v. United States, 460 U. S. 536, 545 (1983) (emphasis added). Accord, United States v. County of Fresno, 429 U. S. 452, 462-464 (1977); South Carolina v. Baker, 485 U. S. 505, 526, n. 15 (1988).\\nThere can be no doubt that the taxation scheme at issue in Davis and the one employed by the Commonwealth of *127 Virginia provided that necessary \"political check.\" They exempted only a small group of citizens, state retirees, while subjecting the remainder of their citizensfederal retirees, retirees who receive income from private sources, and nonretirees aliketo a uniform income tax. As a result, any attempt to increase income taxes excessively so as to interfere with federal interests would have caused the similarly taxed populace to \"use their votes\" to protect their interests, thereby protecting the interests of the Federal Government as well. There being no risk of abusive taxation of the National Government, there was a good argument that there should have been no intergovernmental immunity problem either. See Davis, 489 U. S., at 821-824 (Stevens, J., dissenting).\\nIn addition, distinguishing between taxation of state retirees and all others, including private and federal retirees, was justifiable from an economic standpoint. The State, after all, does not merely collect taxes from its retirees; it pays their benefits as well. As a result, it makes no difference to the State or the retirees whether the State increases state retirement benefits in an amount sufficient to cover taxes it imposes, or whether the State offers reduced benefits and makes them tax free. The net income level of the retirees and the impact on the state fisc is the same. Thus, the Michigan Department of Taxation had a good argument that its differential treatment of state and federal retirees was \"directly related to, and justified by, [a] significant differenc[e] between the two classes,\" id., at 816 (internal quotation marks omitted): Taxing federal retirees enhances the State's fisc, whereas taxing state retirees does not.\\nI recite these arguments not to show that the decision in Davis was wrongI joined the opinion then and remain of the view that it was correctbut instead to point out that the arguments on the other side were substantial. Of course, the Court was able to \"ancho[r] its decision in precedent,\" ante, at 112 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring *128 in judgment). But surely that cannot be dispositive. Few decisions are so novel that there is no precedent to which they may be moored. What is determinative is that the decision was \"sufficiently debatable\" ex ante that, under Chevron Oil, nonretroactivity cannot be precluded. Arizona Governing Committee v. Norris, 463 U. S., at 1109 (O'Connor, J., concurring). That, it seems to me, is the case here.\\n\\n2\\nThe second Chevron Oil factor is whether denying the rule retroactive application will retard its operation in light of the rule's history, purpose, and effect. 404 U. S., at 107. That factor overwhelmingly favors respondent. The purpose of the intergovernmental immunity doctrine is to protect the rights of the Federal Sovereign against state interference. It does not protect the private rights of individuals:\\n\"[T]he purpose of the immunity was not to confer benefits on the employees by relieving them from contributing their share of the financial support of the other government . . . , but to prevent undue interference with the one government by imposing on it the tax burdens of the other.\" Graves v. New York ex rel. O'Keefe, 306 U. S. 466, 483-484 (1939) (footnote omitted).\\nAccord, Davis, supra, at 814 (\"[I]ntergovernmental tax immunity is based on the need to protect each sovereign's governmental operations from undue interference by the other\"). Affording petitioners retroactive relief in this case would not vindicate the interests of the Federal Government. Instead, it lines the pockets of the Government's former employees. It therefore comes as no surprise that the United States, despite its consistent participation in intergovernmental immunity cases in the past, has taken no position here. Because retroactive application of the rule in Davis  serves petitioners' interests but not the interests intergovernmental *129 immunity was meant to protectthe Federal Government'sdenying Davis retroactive application would not undermine the decision's purpose or effect.\\n\\n3\\nThe final factor under Chevron Oil is whether the decision \"`could produce substantial inequitable results if applied retroactively.' \" Chevron Oil, supra, at 107 (quoting Cipriano  v. City of Houma, 395 U. S., at 706). We repeatedly have declined to give our decisions retroactive effect where doing so would be unjust. In Arizona Governing Committee v. Norris, supra, for example, we declined to apply a Title VII decision retroactively, noting that the resulting \"unanticipated financial burdens would come at a time when many States and local governments are struggling to meet substantial fiscal deficits.\" Id., at 1106-1107 (Powell, J., joined by Burger, C. J., Blackmun, Rehnquist, and O'Connor, JJ.). There was \"no justification\" for \"impos[ing] this magnitude of burden retroactively on the public,\" we concluded. Id., at 1107. Accord, id., at 1107-1111 (O'Connor, J., concurring); see id., at 1075 (per curiam). Similarly, we declined to afford the plaintiff full retroactive relief in Los Angeles Dept. of Water and Power v. Manhart, 435 U. S. 702, 718-723 (1978) (Stevens, J.). There, too, we explained that \"[r]etroactive liability could be devastating\" and that \"[t]he harm would fall in large part on innocent third parties.\" Id. , at 722-723.\\nThose same considerations exist here. Retroactive application of rulings that invalidate state tax laws have the potential for producing \"disruptive consequences for the State[s] and [their] citizens. A refund, if required by state or federal law, could deplete the state treasur[ies], thus threatening the State[s'] current operations and future plans.\" American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith, 496 U. S., at 182 (plurality opinion). Retroactive application of Davis  is no exception. \"The fiscal implications of Davis for the *130 [S]tates,\" one commentator has noted, \"are truly staggering.\" Hellerstein, Preliminary Reflections on McKesson and American Trucking Associations, 48 Tax Notes 325, 336 (1990). The States estimate that their total liability will exceed $1.8 billion. Brief for Respondent SA-1; Brief for State of Utah et al. as Amici Curiae 12-13. Virginia's share alone exceeds $440 million. Brief for Respondent SA-1; Brief for State of Utah et al. as Amici Curiae 12-13. This massive liability could not come at a worse time. See Wall Street Journal, July 27, 1992, p. A2 (\"Most states are in dire fiscal straits, and their deteriorating tax base is making it harder for them to get out, a survey of legislatures indicates\"). Accord, Harper v. Virginia Dept. of Taxation, 241 Va., at 239-240, 401 S. E. 2d, at 873 (such massive liability \"would have a potentially disruptive and destructive impact on the Commonwealth's planning, budgeting, and delivery of essential state services\"); Swanson v. State, 329 N. C. 576, 583, 407 S. E. 2d 791, 794 (1991) (\"this State is in dire financial straits\" and $140 million in refunds would exacerbate it); Bass v. State, 302 S. C. 250, 256, 395 S. E. 2d 171, 174 (1990) ($200 million in refunds \"would impose a severe financial burden on the State and its citizens [and] endanger the financial integrity of the State\"). To impose such liability on Virginia and the other States that relied in good faith on their taxation laws, \"at a time when most States are struggling to fund even the most basic services, is the height of unfairness.\" James B. Beam, 501 U. S., at 558 (O'Connor, J., dissenting).\\nIt cannot be contended that such a burden is justified by the States' conduct, for the liability is entirely disproportionate to the offense. We do not deal with a State that willfully violated the Constitution but rather one that acted entirely in good faith on the basis of an unchallenged statute. Moreover, during the four years in question, the constitutional violation produced a benefit of approximately $8 million to $12 million per year, Tr. of Oral Arg. 33, 36, and that benefit accrued not to the Commonwealth but to individual retirees. *131 Yet, for that $32 million to $48 million error, the Court now allows the imposition of liability well in excess of $400 million dollars. Such liability is more than just disproportionate; it is unconscionable. Finally and perhaps most important, this burden will not fall on some thoughtless government official or even the group of retirees that benefited from the offending exemption. Instead the burden falls squarely on the backs of the blameless and unexpecting taxpayers of the affected States who, although they profited not at all from the exemption, will now be forced to pay higher taxes and be deprived of essential services.\\nPetitioners, in contrast, would suffer no hardship if the Court refused to apply Davis retroactively. For years, 23 States enforced taxation schemes like the Commonwealth's in good faith, and for years not a single taxpayer objected on intergovernmental immunity grounds. No one put the States on notice that their taxing schemes might be constitutionally suspect. Denying Davis retroactive relief thus would not deny petitioners a benefit on which they had relied. It merely would deny them an unanticipated windfall. Because that windfall would come only at the cost of imposing hurtful consequences on innocent taxpayers and the communities in which they live, I believe the substantial inequity of imposing retroactive relief in this case, like the other Chevron factors, weighs in favor of denying Davis retroactive application.\\n\\nIII\\nEven if the Court is correct that Davis must be applied retroactively in this case, there is the separate question of the remedy that must be given. The questions of retroactivity and remedy are analytically distinct. American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith, supra, at 189 (plurality opinion) (\"[T]he Court has never equated its retroactivity principles with remedial principles\"). As Justice Souter explained in James B. Beam, supra, at 534, retroactivity is a matter of choice of law \"[s]ince the question is whether the court *132 should apply the old rule or the new one.\" When the retroactivity of a decision of this Court is in issue, the choice-oflaw issue is a federal question. Ashland Oil, Inc. v. Caryl, 497 U. S. 916, 918 (1990) (per curiam). \\nThe question of remedy, however, is quite different. The issue is not whether to apply new law or old law, but what relief should be afforded once the prevailing party has been determined under applicable law. See James B. Beam, 501 U. S., at 535 (Souter, J.) (\"Once a rule is found to apply `backward,' there may then be a further issue of remedies, i. e., whether the party prevailing under a new rule should obtain the same relief that would have been awarded if the rule had been an old one\"). The question of remedies is in the first instance a question of state law. See ibid. (\"[T]he remedial inquiry is one governed by state law, at least where the case originates in state court\"). In fact, the only federal question regarding remedies is whether the relief afforded is sufficient to comply with the requirements of due process. See McKesson Corp. v. Division of Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco, Fla. Dept. of Business Regulation, 496 U. S. 18, 31-52 (1990).\\nWhile the issue of retroactivity is properly before us, the question of remedies is not. It does not appear to be within the question presented, which asks only if Davis may be applied \"nonretroactively so as to defeat federal retirees' entitlement to refunds.\" Pet. for Cert. i. Moreover, our consideration of the question at this juncture would be inappropriate, as the Supreme Court of Virginia has yet to consider what remedy might be available in light of Davis ` retroactivity and applicable state law. The Court inexplicably discusses the question at length nonetheless, noting that if the Commonwealth of Virginia provides adequate predeprivation remedies, it is under no obligation to provide full retroactive refunds today. Ante, at 100-102.\\nWhen courts take it upon themselves to issue helpful guidance in dictum, they risk creating additional confusion by *133 inadvertently suggesting constitutional absolutes that do not exist. The Court's dictum today follows that course. Amidst its discussion of predeprivation and postdeprivation remedies, the Court asserts that a plaintiff who has been deprived a predeprivation remedy cannot be \"confine[d] . . . to prospective relief.\" Ante, at 101, n. 10. I do not believe the Court's assertion to be correct.\\nOver 20 years ago, Justice Harlan recognized that the equities could be taken into account in determining the appropriate remedy when the Court announces a new rule of constitutional law:\\n\"To the extent that equitable considerations, for example, `reliance,' are relevant, I would take this into account in the determination of what relief is appropriate in any given case. There are, of course, circumstances when a change in the law will jeopardize an edifice which was reasonably constructed on the foundation of prevailing legal doctrine.\" United States v. Estate of Don- nelly, 397 U. S. 286, 296 (1970) (concurring opinion).\\nThe commentators appear to be in accord. See Fallon & Meltzer, New Law, Non-Retroactivity, and Constitutional Remedies, 104 Harv. L. Rev. 1733 (1991) (urging consideration of novelty and hardship as part of the remedial framework rather than as a question of whether to apply old law or new). In my view, and in light of the Court's revisions to the law of retroactivity, it should be constitutionally permissible for the equities to inform the remedial inquiry. In a particularly compelling case, then, the equities might permit a State to deny taxpayers a full refund despite having refused them predeprivation process.\\nIndeed, some Members of this Court have argued that we recognized as much long ago. In American Trucking Assns., 496 U. S., at 219-224 (dissenting opinion), Justice Stevens admitted that this Court repeatedly had applied the Chevron Oil factors to preclude the provision of monetary *134 relief. In Justice Stevens' view, however, Chevron Oil determined the question of remedy rather than which law would apply, new or old. See 496 U. S., at 220 (Chevron Oil and its progeny \"establish a remedial principle for the exercise of equitable discretion by federal courts and not, as the plurality states, a choice-of-law principle applicable to all cases on direct review\"); see also ante, at 95, n. 9 (reserving the possibility that Chevron Oil governs the question of remedies in federal court). If Justice Stevens' view or something like it has prevailed todayand it seems that it hasthen state and federal courts still retain the ability to exercise their \"equitable discretion\" in formulating appropriate relief on a federal claim. After all, it would be wholly anomalous to suggest that federal courts are permitted to determine the scope of the remedy by reference to Chevron Oil, but that state courts are barred from considering the equities altogether. Not only would that unduly restrict state court \"flexibility in the law of remedies,\" Estate of Donnelly, supra, at 297 (Harlan, J., concurring), but it also would turn federalism on its head. I know of no principle of law that permits us to restrict the remedial discretion of state courts without imposing similar restrictions on federal courts. Quite the opposite should be true, as the question of remedies in state court is generally a question of state law in the first instance. James B. Beam, 501 U. S., at 535 (Souter, J.).\\nThe Court cites only a single case that might be read as precluding courts from considering the equities when selecting the remedy for the violation of a novel constitutional rule. That case is McKesson Corp. v. Division of Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco, supra. Ante, at 101-102. But, as the controlling opinion in James B. Beam explains, McKesson cannot be so read. 501 U. S., at 544 (\"Nothing we say here [precludes the right] to raise procedural bars to recovery under state law or demonstrate reliance interests entitled to consideration in determining the nature of the remedy that must be provided, a matter with which McKes- *135 son did not deal \" (emphases added)). Accord, id., at 543 (\"[N]othing we say here precludes consideration of individual equities when deciding remedial issues in particular cases\"). It is true that the Court in McKesson rejected, on due process grounds, the State of Florida's equitable arguments against the requirement of a full refund. But the opinion did not hold that those arguments were irrelevant as a categorical matter. It simply held that the equities in that case were insufficient to support the decision to withhold a remedy. The opinion expressly so states, rejecting the State's equitable arguments as insufficiently \"weighty in these circumstances. \" McKesson, 496 U. S., at 45 (emphasis added).\\nThe circumstances in McKesson were quite different than those here. In McKesson, the tax imposed was patently unconstitutional: The State of Florida collected taxes under its Liquor Tax statute even though this Court already had invalidated a \"virtually identical\" tax. Id., at 46. Given that the State could \"hardly claim surprise\" that its statute was declared invalid, this Court concluded that the State's reliance on the presumptive validity of its statute was insufficient to preclude monetary relief. Ibid. As we explained in American Trucking Assns., the large burden of retroactive relief is \"largely irrelevant when a State violates constitutional norms well established under existing precedent.\" We cited McKesson as an example. 496 U. S., at 183 (plurality opinion).\\nA contrary reading of McKesson would be anomalous in light of this Court's immunity jurisprudence. The Federal Government, for example, is absolutely immune from suit absent an express waiver of immunity; and federal officers enjoy at least qualified immunity when sued in a Bivens action. Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388 (1971). As a result, an individual who suffers a constitutional deprivation at the hands of a federal officer very well may have no access to backwards-looking (monetary) relief. I do not see why the Due Process Clause would *136 require a full, backwards-looking compensatory remedy whenever a governmental official reasonably taxes a citizen under what later turns out to be an unconstitutional statute but not where the officer deprives a citizen of her bodily integrity or her life.\\nIn my view, ifthe Court is going to restrict authority to temper hardship by holding our decisions nonretroactive through the Chevron Oil factors, it must afford courts the ability to avoid injustice by taking equity into account when formulating the remedy for violations of novel constitutional rules. See Fallon & Meltzer, 104 Harv. L. Rev. 1733 (1991). Surely the Constitution permits this Court to refuse plaintiffs full backwards-looking relief under Chevron Oil; we repeatedly have done so in the past. American Trucking Assns., supra, at 188-200 (canvassing the Court's practice); see also supra, at 115-116, 129. I therefore see no reason why it would not similarly permit state courts reasonably to consider the equities in the exercise of their sound remedial discretion.\\n\\nIV\\nIn my view, the correct approach to the retroactivity question before us was articulated in Chevron Oil some 22 years ago. By refusing to apply Chevron Oil today, the Court not only permits the imposition of grave and gratuitous hardship on the States and their citizens, but also disregards settled precedents central to the fairness and accuracy of our decisional processes. Nor does the Court cast any light on the nature of the regime that will govern from here on. To the contrary, the Court's unnecessary innuendo concerning pure prospectivity and ill-advised dictum regarding remedial issues introduce still greater uncertainty and disorder into this already chaotic area. Because I cannot agree with the Court's decision or the manifestly unjust results it appears to portend, I respectfully dissent.\\nNOTES\\n[*]   Briefs of amici curiae urging affirmance were filed for the State of Arkansas by Winston Bryant, Attorney General of Arkansas, and Joyce Kinkead; for the State of Georgia by Michael J.

S. 263 (1967)).\\n[9]  We need not debate whether Chevron Oil represents a true \"choice-oflaw principle\" or merely \"a remedial principle for the exercise of equitable discretion by federal courts.\" American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith, 496 U. S. 167, 220 (1990) (Stevens, J., dissenting). Compare id., at 191 197 (plurality opinion) (treating Chevron Oil as a choice-of-law rule), with id., at 218-224 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (treating Chevron Oil as a remedial doctrine). Regardless of how Chevron Oil is characterized, our decision today makes it clear that \"the Chevron Oil test cannot determine the choice of law by relying on the equities of the particular case\" and that the federal law applicable to a particular case does not turn on \"whether [litigants] actually relied on [an] old rule [or] how they would suffer from retroactive application\" of a new one. James B. Beam Distilling Co. v. Georgia, 501 U. S. 529, 543 (1991) (opinion of Souter, J.).\\n[10]  A State incurs this obligation when it \"places a taxpayer under duress promptly to pay a tax when due and relegates him to a postpayment refund action in which he can challenge the tax's legality.\" McKesson, 496 U. S., at 31. A State that \"establish[es] various sanctions and summary remedies designed\" to prompt taxpayers to \"tender . . . payments before  their objections are entertained and resolved\" does not provide taxpayers \"a meaningful opportunity to withhold payment and to obtain a predeprivation determination of the tax assessment's validity.\" Id., at 38 (emphasis in original). Such limitations impose constitutionally significant \"`duress'\" because a tax payment rendered under these circumstances must be treated as an effort \"to avoid financial sanctions or a seizure of real or personal property.\" Id., at 38, n. 21. The State accordingly may not confine a taxpayer under duress to prospective relief.\\n[1]  The dissent attempts to distinguish between retroactivity in civil and criminal settings on three grounds, none of which has ever been adopted by this Court. The dissent's first argument begins with the observation that \"nonretroactivity in criminal cases historically has favored the government's reliance interests over the rights of criminal defendants.\" Post, at 121. But while it is true that prospectivity was usually employed in the past (during the brief period when it was used in criminal cases) to favor the government, there is no basis for the implicit suggestion that it would usually favor the government in the future. That phenomenon was a consequence, not of the nature of the doctrine, cf. James  v. United States, 366 U. S. 213 (1961), but of the historical \"accident\" that during the period prospectivity was in fashion legal rules favoring the government were more frequently overturned. But more fundamentally, to base a rule of full retroactivity in the criminal-law area upon what the dissent calls \"the generalized policy of favoring individual rights over governmental prerogative,\" post, at 121, makes no more sense than to adopt, because of the same \"generalized policy,\" a similarly gross rule that no decision favoring criminal defendants can ever be overruled. The law is more discerning than that. The dissent's next argument is based on the dubious empirical assumption that civil litigants, but not criminal defendants, will often receive some benefit from a prospective decision. That assumption does not hold even in this case: Prospective invalidation of Virginia's taxing scheme would afford petitioners the enormous future \"benefit,\" ibid., of knowing that others in the State are being taxed more. But empirical problems aside, the dissent does not explain why, if a receipt-of-some-benefit principle is important, we should use such an inaccurate proxy as the civil/criminal distinction, or how this newly discovered principle overcomes the \"basic norms of constitutional adjudication\" on which Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U. S. 314, 322 (1987), rested. Finally, the dissent's \"equal treatment\" argument ably distinguishes between cases in which a prospectivity claim is properly raised, and those in which it is not. See post, at 122. But that does nothing to distinguish between civil and criminal cases; obviously, a party may procedurally default on a claim in either context.\\n[2]  Contrary to the suggestion in the dissent, I am not arguing that we should \"cast overboard our entire retroactivity doctrine with . . . [an] unceremonious heave-ho.\" Post, at 116 (emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted). There is no need. We cast over the first half six Terms ago in Griffith, and deep-sixed most of the rest two Terms ago in James B. Beam Distilling Co. v. Georgia, 501 U. S.529 (1991)in neither case unceremoniously (in marked contrast to some of the overrulings cited in text). What little, if any, remains is teetering at the end of the plank and needs no more than a gentle nudge. But if the entire doctrine had been given a quick and unceremonious end, there could be no complaint on the grounds of stare decisis; as it was born, so should it die. I do not know the basis for the dissent's contention that I find the jurisprudence of the era that produced the doctrine of prospectivity \"distasteful.\" Post, at 116. Much of it is quite appetizing. It is only the cavalier treatment of stare decisis and the invention of prospectivity that I have criticized here.\\n[*]   Swanson v.

                                                                                                                                           *18  Justice delivered the opinion of the Court. By the Raker Act of December 19, 1913, 1 Congress granted the City and County of San Francisco, 2 subject to express conditions, certain lands and rights-of-way in the public domain in Yosemite National Park and Stanis-laus National Forest. The Act in terms declared that this, known as the “Hetch-Hetchy” grant, was intended for use by the City both in constructing and maintaining *a means of supplying water for the ■'domestic purposes of the City and other public bodies, and in establishing a system “for generation and sale and distribution of electric energy.” Upon application of the Secretary of the Interior, the United States brought this suit 3 in equity charging the City with disposing of power through the Pacific Gas & Electric Company, a private utility, in violation of § 6 of the granting Act. Section 6 provides “That the grantee [the City] is prohibited from ever selling or letting to any corporation or individual, except a municipality or a municipal water district or irrigation district, the right to sell or sublet the water or the electric energy sold or given to it or him by the grantee: Provided, That the rights hereby granted shall not be sold, *19 assigned, or transferred to any private person, corporation, or association, and in case of any attempt to so sell, assign, transfer, or convey, this grant shall revert to the Government of the United States.” The District Court concluded that the City was violating § 6 by the sale and distribution of Hetch-Hetchy power through the Pacific Gas & Electric Company, a private utility. Accordingly, the City was required by injunction alternatively to discontinue such disposal of the power or cease further use of the. lands and rights granted it under the Act for generation and transmission of electric energy. 4 The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, 5 finding that the private utility was merely acting as the City’s agent in the sale and distribution of Hetch-Hetchy power and holding that § 6 does not prohibit such sale and distribution of that power by a private utility. Here, as in the courts below, the City has defended the sale and distribution by Pacific Gas & Electric Company of power originating at Hetch-Hetchy upon the grounds that such disposition does not violate' the prohibitions of § 6; that imposition of these prohibitions was not within the constitutional authority of Congress; and that if § 6 is valid and has been violated, the United States is not entitled to injunctive relief in equity. First. Prohibitions of Section 6. — In the City’s view, § 6 does not preclude private utilities from all participation in the ultimate sale and distribution of Hetch-Hetchy power. The City insists that the Section, so construed, does no more than prohibit the City from selling *20 Hetch-Hetchy power to a private utility 'for resale to consumers and therefore permits consignment of the power to the Company, as agent of the City, for sale and distribution. On the contrary, the Government’s position rests upon the claim that Pacific Gas & Electric Company is not in reality selling and distributing Hetch-Hetchy power as consignee and agent but as purchaser for resale; that the grant to the City was made upon the mandatory condition that this power be sold solely and exclusively by the City directly to consumers and without private profit in order to bring it into direct competition with adjacent privately owned utilities; and that § 6 not only withholds the right of selling for resale but also prohibits the City “from ever selling or letting” to any private corporation “the right to sell or sublet the . . . electric energy sold or given to it ... ” by the City. The language of the Act, its background and its history require the construction given § 6 by the Government. From its provisions, 6 it is apparent that the Act conditions the grant upon and contemplates the development, sale and distribution of electrical power by the City itself “for municipal and commercial use” on a scale to be gradually stepped up over a period of years. “The . . . grantee shall develop and use hydroelectric power for the use of its people and shall . . . sell or supply such power for irrigation, pumping, or other beneficial use.” The “right to sell or sublet the . . . electric energy” so generated by the City cannot, as a consequence of § 6, be sold or let. And in case of any attempt to “sell, assign, transfer, or convey [the rights granted], this grant shall revert to the Government of the United States.” From the statement of the Congressman responsible for the application of the prohibitions of § 6 specifically to *21 electric energy, 7 it is clear that as enacted § 6 was understood to prohibit the City from transferring to a private utility the right to sell Hetch-Hetchy power (the Government’s contention) and not merely to forbid sale of power as a commodity for resale, as the City would have us hold: “Mr. Taylor of Colorado. We have got to let the municipality sell to individuals or consumers. “Mr. Thomson of Illinois. Yes; but not the right to sell some one else the power. “Mr. Taylor of Colorado. Supposing that San Francisco sells a certain block, you may say, of its power to Alameda. Has not Alameda got the right to resell that to its inhabitants? “Mr. Thomson of Illinois.  Chairman, in answering the question of the gentleman from Colorado, I would like to call his attention to the fact that the subject of sale as printed in this section is not the power or the water, but the right to sell the power or the water. C( “Mr. Raker. That [the word “individual”] really is intended to cover any person who might attempt to buy this electric power or right. I think it would cover everybody outside of a corporation, the intention being to prevent anybody getting in and getting a right and sub-letting it.” 8 In its Report on the Bill, the House Committee on Public Lands stated that the provision of § 6 “acquiesced in by the grantee, was designed to prevent any monoply or private corporation from hereafter obtaining control of the water supply of San Francisco.” 9 *22 From the congressional debates on the passage of the Raker Act can be read a common understanding both on the part of sponsors of the Bill and its opponents that the grant was to be so conditioned as to require municipal performance of the function of supplying Hetch-Hetchy water and electric power directly to the ultimate consumers, and to prohibit sale or distribution of that power and water by any private corporation or individual. 10 On the floor of the House, the following took place between the Bill’s author and other Representatives: “Mr. Sumners. Does San Francisco own its own lighting plant now? “Mr. Kahn. No; it does not. “Mr. Raker. I understand it does not. “Mr. Kahn. It does not own its own water supply. Its present water supply is furnished by a private company. “Mr. Raker. The Spring Valley Water System. “Mr. Sumners. Is it the purpose of this bill to have San Francisco supply electric power and water to its own people? “Mr. Raker. Yes. “Mr. Sumners. Or to supply these corporations, which will in turn supply the people? - “Mr. Raker. Under this bill it is to supply its own inhabitants first. . . .” 11 These views were in accord with the recommendation of the then Secretary of the Interior, as set out in the Report of the Public Lands Committee of the House: *23 “I think that it is very proper that the Federal Government should use whatever power it has over the public lands, over the parks, and over the forests, to compel the fullest use of these waters, and indirectly to require through its power to make conditions, the lowest possible rate for consumers.” 12 The theme — of an intent to require public utilization of Hetch-Hetchy power independently of private utilities — recurred at a later stage of the debate in the House: “Mr. Gray. ... “As I understand the bill, it provides for the furnishing of water, and also for power for commercial use. . . . “. . . if these works here are to be contructed to serve the baseness of commercialism, it is the vilest of all vandalism. My suggestion here to you is to strike out of this bill all the commercial profit. . . . “Mr. Kent [a Member of the California delegation and a supporter of the measure].  Chairman, I should like to suggest to the gentleman from Indiana [Mr. Gray] that this bill is strictly drawn in the public interest, that there is no possibility of selfish gain, and that no corporation or individual can obtain any benefit whatsoever from this bill. It is for the benefit of the people of California.”' 13 In the Senate, Senator Thomas, a member of the Committee reporting the Bill, said: “. . . San Francisco needs electric power, and California needs development in electric power just as much as she needs ownership in water, . . . *24 “. . . She is anxious to extend her spheres of municipal . usefulness, but she is in the grip of a power monopoly as well as that of the Spring \"Valley Co. “. . . This scheme appeals to me,  President, so far as the power is concerned, because the city of San Francisco as a municipality will be the owner of it, the manufacturer, the distributor of it.” 14 And the words of Senator Norris, also a Member of the reporting Committee and a leading sponsor of the Bill, on the day of its final passage through the Senate, illuminate just what the Raker Act was intended to accomplish: “. . . I said that I was in favor of this bill to a great extent for the reason that it developed this power. This power will come into competition with the various waterpower companies of California, and there are lots of them there. “. . . this proposition is to harness that power and to put it to public use not to give it to a private corporation. . . . “Here is an instance where we are going to give it directly to the people, if we pass this bill. It is going to come into competition with power companies and corporations that have, or will have, if this bill is defeated, almost a monopoly not only in San Francisco but throughout the greater portion of California. (( “These make in all, as I have counted them, 18 corporations controlling the power in the vicinity of Sain Francisco that are under the control of this one corporation. [Pacific Gas & Electric Company.] “. . . When you sum them all up you will find that they own practically all of the hydroelectric power of the State of California, and this bill, if passed, will bring *25 into competition with them one of the greatest units for the development of power that has ever been developed in the history of the world. It means competition. “. . . Conservation does not mean dealing out these resources to private capital for gain. It is not necessary to accuse those corporations of doing any wrong; but here will be an instance where the cheapest power on earth will be developed and where it will be sold at cost.” 15 Opponents of the Bill themselves recognized that its regulatory conditions were designed to insure distribution of power from Hetch-Hetchy through a municipal system in San Francisco. Before final passage in the Senate, opposition had practically narrowed down to the power provisions of the measure, 16 and these provisions contemplated a publicly owned and operated power system. 17 *26 Immediately before the vote in the Senate, Senator Mc-Cumber, opposed to the power provisions of § 6, offered a sweeping amendment which would have omitted that section and all other provisions relating to the generation, sale and distribution of Hetch-Hetchy power. 18 But his amendment was defeated. 19 And despite this articulate opposition to the policy embodied in its power features, the Act was passed. To limit the prohibitions of § 6 of the Act narrowly to sales of power for resale without more, as the City asks, would permit evasion and frustration of the purpose of the lawmakers. Congress clearly intended to require— as a condition of its grant — sale and distribution of Hetch-Hetchy power exclusively by San Francisco and municipal agencies directly to consumers in the belief that consumers would thus be afforded power at cheap rates in competition with private power companies, particularly Pacific Gas & Electric Company. It is not the office of the courts to pass upon the justification for that belief or the efficacy of the measures chosen for putting it into effect. Selection of the emphatically expressed purpose embodied in this Act was the appropriate business of the legislative body. *27 The admitted facts shown by this record required the District Court to find — as it did — that the City was violating § 6 in permitting sale and distribution of Hetch-Hetchy power by the Pacific Gas & Electric Company. Now, as it has been doing since contracting with the City in 1925, the Company sells and distributes that power as follows: Power generated in the City’s plant is transmitted to the Company at Newark, about thirty-five miles from San Francisco. There the power is delivered to the Company’s sub-station and thereafter is under the Company’s complete control. The Company distributes and sells this power to its customers in San Francisco and elsewhere exactly as it handles other power which it generates, buys or owns. Consumers of the power are billed by and pay the Company. The City buys Hetch-Hetchy power from the Company exactly as do other consumers. The City receives monthly payments from the Company on a fixed basis set out in the contract. The price received by the City has remained constant from 1925 to date although rates to the consumers have varied in the interim. In the event of the refusal, failure or inability of the Company to take the available output of the City’s plant in accordance with the agreement, the amount of energy which the City could have delivered is the basis of making the monthly payment, and the Company must pay for power delivered to it whether actually disposed of by resale or not. The rate paid by consumers for the Hetch-Hetchy power is not fixed by the City, as it could be under the Constitution of California, 20 but is fixed by the State Railroad Commission just as the price of *28 all other power sold by the Pacific Gas & Electric Company in California is fixed. Thus, in brief, the City does not itself distribute and sell the power directly to consumers; it has not provided competition with the private power company; and it has transferred the right to sell and distribute the power to a private power company in violation of the express prohibition of § 6 of the Act. Terminology of consignment of power, rather than of transfer by sale, and verbal description of the power Com-' pany as the City’s agent or consignee, are not sufficient to take the actions of the parties under the contract out of § 6. Congress, in effect trustee of public lands for all the people, has by this Act sought to protect and control the disposition of a section of the public domain. The City has in fact followed a course of conduct which Congress, by § 6, has forbidden. Mere words and ingenuity of contractual expression, whatever their effect between the parties, cannot by description make permissible a course of conduct forbidden by law. When we look behind the word description of the arrangement between the City and the power Company to what was actually done, we see that the City has — contrary to the terms of § 6 — abdicated its control over the sale and ultimate distribution of Hetch-Hetchy power. There remain only the determinations whether the prohibitions of § 6 are constitutional and can be enforced in equity. Second. The prohibitions of § 6 are challenged by the City as an unconstitutional invasion of the rights of the State of California on the ground that they attempt to regulate the manner in which electricity shall be disposed of in San Francisco. And the City therefore insists that these prohibitions must be considered only as covenants in a contract between the City and the United States. Upon this premise, the City has argued here, as it did in *29 the Court of Appeals, that alleged equitable defenses render the covenants unenforceable. When the Raker Bill was before Congress, the City filed with the Public Lands Committee of the House a brief and argument in support of the Bill. Citing authorities, including this Court’s opinions, and legislative precedents, the City submitted to Congress that as grantee it would be bound by and as grantor Congress was empowered to impose “the conditions set forth in the Hetch-Hetchy bill.” 21 After passage of the Bill the City accepted the grant by formal ordinance, assented to all the conditions contained in the grant, constructed the required power and water facilities, and up to date has utilized the rights, privileges and benefits granted by Congress. Now, the City seeks to retain the benefits of the Act while attacking the constitutionality of one of its important conditions. 22 Article 4, § 3, Cl. 2 of the Constitution provides that “The Congress shall have Power to dispose of and make all heedful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory and other Property belonging to the United States.” The power over the public land thus entrusted to Congress is without limitations. 23 “And it is not for the courts to say how that trust shall be administered. That is for Con *30 gress to determine.” 24 Thus, Congress may constitutionally limit the disposition of the public domain to a manner consistent with its views of public policy. And the policy to govern disposal of rights to develop hydroelectric power in such public lands may, if Congress chooses, be one designed to avoid monopoly and to bring about a wide-spread distribution of benefits. The statutory requirement that Hetch-Hetchy power be publicly distributed does not represent an exercise of a general control over public policy in a State but instead only an exercise of the complete power which Congress has over particular public property entrusted to it. 25 Third. Finally, on the basis of numerous objections to the District Court’s judgment, assigned as errors in the court below and pressed here, the City denies the Government’s right — upon a balancing of equities — to.relief by injunction even if the present disposition of Hetch-Hetchy power be in violation of the Act. However, after consideration of all these objections, we are satisfied that this case does not call for a balancing of equities or for the invocation of the generalities of judicial maxims in order to determine whether an injunction should have issued. The City is availing itself of valuable rights and privileges granted by the Government and yet persists in violating the very conditions upon which those benefits were granted. Congress provided “That the grantee [City] shall at all times comply with and observe on its part all the conditions specified in this Act, and in the event that the same are not reasonably complied, with and carried out by the grantee, upon written request of the Secretary of the Interior, it is made the duty of the Attorney General in the name of the United *31 States to commence all necessary suits or proceedings in the proper court having jurisdiction thereof, for the purpose of enforcing and carrying out the provisions of this Act.” Pursuant to this legislative mandate, the present suit was instituted to enforce covenants exacted from a grantee of rights in the public domain by a Congress sympathetic with the local needs of San Francisco but also jealous of its own responsibility to dispose of such rights in a manner de'emed by it most likely to render their benefits widespread. The equitable doctrines relied on do not militate against the capacity of a court of equity as a proper forum in which to make a declared policy of Congress effective. Injunction to prohibit continued use — in violation of that policy — of property granted by the United States, and to enforce the grantee’s covenants, is both appropriate and necessary. 26 A substantial part of the City’s argument rests upon its claim that the Department of the Interior in the period from 1913 to 1937 construed § 6 to forbid no more than sale of power for resale. We are asked to accept these administrative interpretations. And in addition the City suggests that conduct of the Department, of which these interpretations were a part, is sufficient to create an estoppel against the Government. Whether the Department at any time ever did more than merely to tolerate sale and distribution of Hetch-Hetchy power by the Company as a temporary expedient is doubtful. Certain it is, however, that in 1935 the Secretary of the Interior declared the City’s disposition of the power through the Company to be a violation of § 6, demanded discontinuance of this violation without success and thereafter instigated this proceeding. We cannot accept the contention that administrative rulings — such as those here *32 relied on — can thwart the plain purpose of a valid law. As to estoppel, it is enough to repeat that “ . . . the United States is neither bound nor estopped by acts of its officers or agents in entering into an arrangement or agreement to do or cause to- be done what the law does not sanction or permit.” 27 The judgment of the Circuit Court is reversed. The judgment of the District Court is affirmed and we remand the case to it. Reversed.  Justice McReynolds is of the opinion that the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals should be affirmed. 1 c. 4, 38 Stat. 242. 2 The City and County of San Francisco is a municipal corporation of California and will be referred to here as the City. 3 Section 9 (u) of the Act contains the following: “Provided, however, That the grantee shall at all times comply with and observe on its part all the conditions specified in this Act, and in the event that the same are not reasonably complied with and carried but by the grantee, upon written request of the Secretary of the Interior, it is made the duty of the Attorney General in the name of the United States to commence all necessary suits or proceedings in the proper court having jurisdiction thereof, for the purpose of enforcing and carrying out the provisions of this Act.” 38 Stat. 250. 4 23 F. Supp. 40. The District Court stated: “In order that the City may face its problem and comply with its obligations under section 6 of the Raker Act, the court will make its injunction issuable forthwith, but effective six months from the date of its issue.” p. 53. 5 106 F. 2d 569. 6 See § 9 (rn). 7 50 Cong.

I wanted the question of regulations taken out of the controversy and the bill reported to the Senate without those regulations in it. “Mr. President, I do not think there ought to be any misunderstanding about this matter. The Senator himself, I think, will admit that the principal object of this bill is to provide for the creation of power, . . .” “. . .1 will, moreover, say that it is my opinion that the reason San Francisco wants this particular dam site is for the power that she thinks can be developed cheaper than from any other source, and at the same time get a large supply of water. That is my personal opinion.” 51 Cong.

                                                                                                                                                                                                   Me. Justice delivered the opinion of the Court. This appeal involves the validity of the Public Revenue Service Tax Act of Colorado. 1 The act, § 5, imposes upon the services specified in the act, a percentage tax based upon the value of the services rendered or performed by any person subject to its provisions. *44 Section 5 (c) imposes a tax equivalent to two per cent of the value of services rendered by “banks, finance companies, trust companies and depositories . . .” The person rendering the services “shall be liable and responsible for the payment of the entire amount ...” § 6. He is required to remit all taxes collected and due the state from him to the treasurer less three per cent to cover the expense of the service. Under § 6 (B) persons rendering or performing the services are required “as far as practicable, [to] add the taix imposed ... to- the value of services or charges showing such tax as a separate and distinct item and when added such tax shall constitute a part of such value of service or charge, shall be a debt from the user to the person rendering or performing service until paid, and shall be recoverable at law in the same manner as other debts.” By subsection (d) the person rendering the service is forbidden to hold out directly or indirectly that he will assume or absorb the tax. By § 7 the user may recover illegally collected taxes. Where services are rendered which become a part of an article subject to a sales fax, the services are exempt and the person performing the service recovers where they are illegally assessed. § 3. By § 12, all sums paid by the user as taxes axe public money and trust funds of the State of Colorado. It is made a'misdemeanor, § 17, for any person rendering or performing services to refuse to make the returns required. The state treasurer is made administrator of the act and given authority to issue regulations. § 19. The usual separability clause is contained in the act. § 22. The definitions of the act appear in § 2. By its subsection (c) the term “services rendered or performed” is defined as those rendered for a valuable consideration by a person covered by the act for the ultimate user thereof. “The term 'user’ shall mean the person for whom or for whose benefit services are rendered or performed.” *45 By subsection (e) taxpayer is defined as “any person obligated to account to the state treasurer for taxes collected or to be collected or due the state under the terms of this act.” Subsection (h) provides for a credit on future taxes of a tax paid on accounts eventually found worthless. Under the rules and regulations issued by the treasurer on the Public Revenue Service Tax Act, the service tax is construed as invalid as applied to so-called banking services. 2 Under rule 27, however, such service as the furnishing of safety vaults by depositories or banks is held to come within the act, and the two per cent tax applies to the charges made for this service. These regulations were approved by the judgment and decree of the trial court and that judgment was affirmed in all particulars by the Supreme Court of Colorado. While § 4 (a) makes it unlawful for any person to render the defined services without “first having obtained a license therefor,” the treasurer demands no license fees from a national bank. Such exception was held proper by the lower court. 3 The appellant here, the Colorado National Bank, was a national banking corporation duly organized and existing under the national banking act. The bank operated a safe-deposit service under its own name and in the building and vaults used for its other banking activities. The rentals received for the use of that portion of. its vaults utilized for safe-deposit boxes were reported to the Comptroller of the Currency as income in the bank; the fixtures employed in the business are-part of the assets of the bank and are supervised by the Comptroller of the Currency. *46 The appellee Bedford, as treasurer of the State of Colorado and administrator of the Service Tax Act, demanded payment from appellant bank of two per cent of the value of the services rendered by the bank to its safe deposit box customers. The bank refused payment and the treasurer brought this action under the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act (Colorado Stat. Anno., 1935, c. 93, §§ 78-79) for a declaration of rights to the effect that the services performed by the bank are taxable pursuant to the Service Tax Act. The bank answered claiming the state statute as applied to it was repugnant to the Constitution and laws of the United States; setting up the immunity of national banks from state taxation except as permitted by R. S. § 5219; 4 claiming that the safe-deposit business of national banks was authorized by Congress and therefore was part of its federally authorized business, immune from taxation whether the bank or the user of its services is the taxpayer. The bank further contended that even though it is not the taxpayer and the tax burden as such is not unlawful, the burden of collection, report- and visitation materially interfere with the performance of its national banking functions. A general demurrer to the answer was filed. The trial court sustained the bank. The supreme court first affirmed by an equally divided court and then on re *47 hearing reversed 5 and remanded the case to the district court. The trial court entered a second judgment declaring as prayed by the treasurer which judgment was affirmed by the supreme court on the authority of the former decision. (1) This appeal is here under § 237 (a) of the Judicial Code. The treasurer makes the point that as the federal question raised was the immunity to the exaction of the bank as a federal instrumentality withdrawn from state taxation by congressional action, the determination that the tax was on a non-banking activity foreign to its federal character and on the user of the services eliminated the necessity of a decision on the federal question. As the statute was held valid after the conclusion of the Supreme Court of Colorado that the manner of state taxation of national banks must accord with R. S. § 5219 and must not interfere with federal functions, 6 it seems clear the federal question as to the validity of the statute as tested by the Constitution and laws of the United States was necessarily involved and decided. This gives this Court jurisdiction of the appeal. 7 Gully v. First National Bank, 8 relied upon by the treasurer, dealt with the right to remove to a federal court 9 because the cause of action arose under the federal laws, 10 but the issue here is the right to appeal where a state statute is held valid against a defense of repug-nancy to the same laws. 11 The difference is brought out *48 in the Gully case, where it is said: “If there were no federal law permitting the taxation of shares in national banks, a suit to recover such a tax would not be one arising under the Constitution of the United States, though the bank would have the aid of the Constitution when it came to its defense.” 12 (2) The genesis of the present system of national banks is the National Bank Act of June 3, 1864. 13 It was called “An Act to provide a National Currency, secured by a Pledge of United States Bonds and to provide for the Circulation and Redemption thereof.” From this act, correlated with the Federal Reserve Act, 14 there has' developed the present nationwide banking facilities. R. S. § 5153 makes these associations the depositories of public money. Though the national banks’ usefulness as an agency to provide for currency has diminished markedly, their importance as general bankers shows a constant growth. 15 We may assume that national banks possess only the powers conferred by Congress. 16 These are set out in R. S. § 5136 as frequently amended and include “all such incidental powers as shall be necessary to carry on the business of banking,” with the proviso “that in carrying on the business commonly known as the safe- *49 deposit business the association shall not invest in the capital stock of a corporation organized under the law of any State to conduct a safe-deposit business in an amount in excess of 15 per centum of the capital stock of the association actually paid in and unimpaired and 15 per centum of its unimpaired surplus.” 17 We have recently found the authority to secure federal funds within these incidental powers, coupled with a long continued practice recognized by the Comptroller of the Currency. 18 The right to accept special deposits is recognized by the banking act. 19 These are monies and other valuables the identical deposits of which are kept, preserved and returned in kind. It differs little if at all from a safe-deposit business. The language of the proviso of § 24, just quoted, is the language suitable to impose restrictions on a recognized power, not the language that would be used in creating a new power. As the limitation on the power to invest in real estate protected in a measure customers and stockholders from risky investments, 20 the banks’ own investment in safety deposit facilities evidently did not seem to Congress to require the same regulation as the purchase of stock in a safe-deposit corporation. A subsidiary safe-deposit corporation would give priority to the creditors of the subsidiary over the depositors and other creditors of the bank itself. The obvious fact, known to all, is that national banks do and for many years have carried on a safe-deposit business. State banks, quite usually, are given the power to *50 conduct a safe-deposit business. 21 We agree with the appellant bank that such a generally adopted method of safeguarding valuables must be considered a banking function authorized by Congress. 22 (3) We may assume, as did the Supreme Court of Colorado, that the tax is invalid if laid upon the bank as an instrumentality of government in the incidents referred to in the preceding section; 23 that its banking operations are free from state taxation except as Congress may permit; 24 that Congress permits the taxation only of shares and real estate; 25 and'that Congress may inter *51 vene to protect its instrumentalities from any other tax which threatens their usefulness. 26 Congress has not legislated against taxation of the customers of national banks. This Court has approved a tax assessed upon the deposits of customers of national banks. 27 By § 6 of the Colorado act the “person rendering or performing services shall be liable” for the payment of the tax imposed. But as subsection (b) of that same section requires the tax paid to be added to the charges for service “as a separate and distinct item” and makes it a debt from the user of the services until paid, the tax is upon the user of the safe-deposit boxés, not upon the bank. Furthermore, as by § 2 (h) credit is given to the bank for taxes paid on accounts subsequently found worthless and the bank is in a position to require payment of box rentals and taxes in advance, there is no occasion for a bank ever to have saddled upon it any part of the tax burden. In National Bank v. Commonwealth 28 this Court determined a similar question in favor of the validity of the state tax. The case was decided in 1869. At that time the applicable federal statute 29 read: “Sec. 41. . . . Provided, That nothing in this act shall be construed to prevent all the shares in any of the said associations, held by any person . . . from being included in the valuation of the personal property of such person ... in the assessment of taxes imposed by or under state authority at the place where such bank is located, and not elsewhere. . . .” The statute of Kentucky laid a tax of fifty cents on each share. The same statute enacted: “The cashier of *52 a bank, whose stock is taxed, shall, on the first day in July of each year, pay into the treasury the amount of tax due. If such tax be not paid, the cashier and his sureties shall be liable for the same, and twenty per cent, upon the amount; and the said bank or corporation shall thereby forfeit the privileges of its charter.” A national bank refused payment on the ground that it as a bank was not subject to state taxation. It was decided that this was a tax on shares, that the state in a .legal proceeding against the shareholder could have garnisheed the bank and that because the bank was a federal instrumentality was no reason for not requiring it to collect and pay over the money from the shareholder. A similar tax was upheld in Des Moines Bank v. Fairweather. 30 The person liable for the tax, primarily, cannot always be said to be the real taxpayer. The taxpayer is the person ultimately liable for the tax itself. 31 The funds which were received by the State came from the assets of the user, not from those of the federal instrumentality, the bank. 32 The Colorado Supreme Court holds the user is the taxpayer. 33 The determination of the state court as to the incidence of the tax has great weight with us and, when it follows logically the language of the act, as here, is controlling. 34 As the user directly furnishes the funds for the tax, not as an ultimate consumer with a transferred burden but by § 12 of the act as the responsible obligor, we conclude the tax is upon *53 him, not upon the bank. The Constitution or laws of the United States do not forbid such a tax. (4) The tax being a permissible tax on customers of the bank, it is settled by our prior decisions that the statutory provisions requiring collection and remission of the taxes do not impose an unconstitutional burden on a federal instrumentality. 35 Especially is this true since the bank under the Colorado act is allowed three per cent of the tax for the financial burden put upon it by the obligation to collect.

Young, 309 U. S. 517. 19 R. S. 5228, 12 U. S. C. § 133. 20 12 U. S. C. § 29: “A national banking association may purchase, hold, and convey real estate for the following purposes, and for no others: “First. Such as shall be necessary for its accommodation in the transaction of its business.” 21 Paton’s Digest, 1926, Vol. 2, p. 2246, lists 24 states and territories which authorize their banks to conduct a safe-deposit business. For example, Maine, Act of 1923, c. 144, § 6, (V), authorizes savings banks to “own, maintain and let safe deposit boxes and vaults.” Ohio, Gen. Code (1921), § 710-109, empowers banks to let out safe-deposit boxes. California, Gen. Laws (1923), Act 652, § 30, any bank may conduct a safe-deposit department, but shall not invest more than one tenth of its capital and surplus in such safe-deposit department. 22 The language of the proviso first appeared in an act to further amend the national banking laws of the Federal Reserve Act enacted February 25, 1927, 44 Stat. 1224, § 2 (b). Only immaterial verbal changes have occurred since the first adoption. Referring to this proviso the House report said: “The second proviso regulates the safe-deposit business of national banks and prohibits ihem from investing an amount in excess of 15 per cent of capital and surplus in a corporation organized to conduct a safe-deposit business in connection with the bank. This is a business which is regularly carried on by national banks and the effect of this provision is also primarily regulative.” H. Rep. No. 83, 69th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 4. 23 Cf. Osborn v. U. S.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    *58Mr. Justice delivered the opinion of the Court. Appellants have challenged the validity of a Virginia statute regulating the insurance of Virginia risks and have brought this suit to enjoin state officers from enforcing *59it. Its relevant provisions, copied in the margin,1 forbid contracts of insurance or surety by companies authorized to do business within that Commonwealth “except through regularly constituted and registered resident agents or agencies of such companies.” § 4222, e. 218, Acts of 1938. Such resident agents “shall be entitled to and shall receive the usual and customary commissions allowed on such contracts,” and may not share more than half of this commission with a non-resident broker. § 4226-a. Disobedience of these provisions (from which life, title and marine companies are exempted) may entail a fine or revocation of the corporate license in Virginia, or both. A district court of three judges, convened under § 266 of the Judicial Code as amended, 28 U. S. C. § 380, dismissed appellants’ bill on the basis of elaborate findings of fact and conclusions of law, set forth in an opinion by Circuit Judge Soper. 29 F. Supp. 71. From this *60decree the case comes here on appeal under § 238 of the Judicial Code as amended, 28 U. S. C. § 345. The bill was brought by foreign corporations authorized to do casualty and surety business in Virginia, and by some of their salaried employees. It is their claim that the statute deprives them of rights protected by the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution. The exact nature of these claims will appear more clearly in the setting of the illuminating findings below which may here be abbreviated. The “production” of insurance — “production” being insurance jargon for obtaining business — is, in the main, carried on by two groups, agents and brokers. Though both are paid by commission, the different.ways in which the two groups perform their functions have important practical consequences in the conduct of the insurance business, and hence in its regulation. The agent is tied to *61his company. But his ability to “produce” business depends upon the confidence of the community in him. He must therefore cultivate the good will and sense of dependence of his clients. He may finance the payment of premiums; he frequently assists in the filing and prosecution of claims; he acts as mediator between insurer and assured in the diverse situations which arise. The broker, on the other hand, is an independent middleman, not tied to a particular company. He meets more specially the needs of large customers, using their concentrated bargaining power to obtain the most favorable terms from competing companies. His activities, being largely confined to the big commercial centers, take place mostly outside Virginia. A policy, whether “produced” by broker or agent, must be “serviced” — an insurance term for assistance rendered a customer in minimizing his risks. To this end the companies exert themselves directly, but the “producer” may render additional service. Only to a limited extent can risks be minimized at long range; local activity is essential. When the contract is “produced” by a non-resident broker the “servicing” function is normally performed by the company exclusively. When the “producer” is a resident agent, the case is ordinarily otherwise. For this, as well as for other reasons, it is obvious that non-resident brokers prefer to negotiate their contracts covering Virginia risks with companies authorized to do business in that Commonwealth. These basic elements in the insurance business attain special significance in the case of enterprises operating not only in Virginia but in other states as well. For them the brokerage system offers the attractions of large-scale production. Through what is known as a master or “hotchpotch” policy, the assured may obtain a cheaper rate by pooling all his risks, whether in or out of Virginia. This wholesale insurance may furnish not only a reduced rate *62but a reduced commission to the customer. These are advantages which naturally draw the Virginia business of interstate enterprises away from local agents in Virginia to the great insurance centers. In affecting the cost of these master policies, say the appellants, Virginia is intruding upon business transactions beyond its borders. Not only is a licensed company forbidden to write insurance except through a resident agent, but the agent cannot retain less than one-half of the customary commission allowed on such a contract for what may, so far as the requirements of the law are concerned, be no> more than the perfunctory service of countersigning the policy. But the question is not whether what Virginia has done will restrict appellants’ freedom of action outside Virginia by subjecting the exercise of such freedom to financial burde/ns. The mere fact that state action may have repercussions beyond state lines is of no judicial significance so long as the action is not within that domain which the Constitution forbids. Alaska Packers Assn. v. Comm’n, 294 U. S. 532; Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. v. Grosjean, 301 U. S. 412. Compare Equitable Life Society v. Pennsylvania, 238 U. S. 143. It is equally immaterial that such state action may run counter to the economic wisdom either of Adam Smith or of J. Maynard Keynes, or may be ultimately mischievous even from the point of view of avowed state policy. Our inquiry must be much narrower. It is whether Virginia has taken hold of a matter within her power, or has reached beyond her borders to regulate a subject which was none of her concern because the Constitution has placed control elsewhere. Compare Wallace v. Hines, 253 U. S. 66, 69. Virginia has not sought to prohibit the making of contracts beyond her borders. She merely claims that her interest in the risks which these contracts are designed to prevent warrants the kind of control she has here *63imposed. This legislation is not to be judged by abstracting an isolated contract written in New York from the organic whole of the insurance business, the effect of that business on Virginia, and Virginia’s regulation of it. A network of legislation controls the surety and casualty business in Virginia. Insolvent companies may not engage in it. Virginia Code, § 4180. Neither companies nor agents may give rebates. § 4222-c. Rates for workmen’s compensation, automobile liability and surety contracts are determined by its Corporation Commission. §§ 1887 (75), 4326-ar-l, 4350-3. The difficulty of enforcing these regulations, so the District Court found, may be increased if policies covering Virginia risks are “produced” without participation by responsible local agents. Rebates evading local restriction may be granted under' cover of business done outside the state. Contrariwise, if resident Virginia agents are made necessary conduits for insurance on Virginia risks now included in master policies, the state may have better means of acquiring accurate information for the effectuation of measures which it deems protective of its interests.2 *64It is claimed that the requirement that not less than one-half of the customary commission be retained by the resident agent is a bald exaction for what may be no more than the perfunctory service of countersigning policies. The short answer to this is that the state may rely on this exaction as a mode of assuring the active use of resident agents for procuring and “servicing” policies covering Virginia risks. These functions, when adequately performed, benefit not only the company, the producer, and the assured. By minimizing the risks of casualty and loss, they redound in a pervasive way to the benefit of the community.3 At least Virginia may so have believed. And she may also have concluded that an agency system, such as this legislation was designed to promote, is better calculated to further these desirable ends than other modes of “production.” 4 When *65these beliefs are emphasized by legislation embodying similar notions of policy in a dozen states,5 it would savor of intolerance for us to suggest that a legislature could not constitutionally entertain the views which the legislation adopts. Compare Prudential Ins. Co. v. Cheek, 259 U. S. 530, 537. The present case, therefore, is wholly unlike those instances in which a “so-called right is used as part of a scheme to accomplish a forbidden result.” Fidelity & Deposit Co. v. Tafoya, 270 U. S. 426, 434. For it is clear that Virginia has a definable interest in the contracts she seeks to regulate and that what she has done is very different from the imposition of conditions upon appellants’ privilege of engaging in local business which would bring within the orbit of state power matters unrelated to any local interests. It is not our province to measure the social advantage to Virginia of regulating the conduct of insurance companies within her borders insofar as it affects Virginia risks. Government has always had a special relation to insurance. The ways of safeguarding against the untoward manifestations of nature and other vicissitudes of life have long been withdrawn from the benefits and caprices of free competition.6 The state may fix insurance rates, German Alliance Ins. Co. v. Lewis, 233 U. S. 389; it may regulate the compensation of agents, *66O’Gorman & Young v. Hartford Fire Ins. Co., 282 U. S. 251; it may curtail drastically the area of free contract, National Ins. Co. v. Wanberg, 260 U. S. 71. States have controlled the expenses of insurance companies, New York Insurance Law, Consolidated Laws of New York, c. 28, § 244, and Wisconsin Statutes, § 201.21; and see Report of Joint (Armstrong) Insurance Investigation Committee (N. Y.) pp. 403-18 (1906). They have also promoted insurance through savings banks; see Berman, The Massachusetts System of Savings Bank Life Insurance, Bulletin No. 615, IT. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, and New York Laws of 1938, c. 471. In the light of all these exertions of state power it does not seem possible to doubt that the state could, if it chose, go into the insurance business, just as it can operate warehouses, flour mills, and other business ventures, Green v. Frazier, 253 U. S. 233, or might take “the whole business of banking under its control,” Noble State Bank v. Haskell, 219 U. S. 104, 113. If the state, as to local risks, could thus preempt the field of insurance for itself, it may stay its intervention short of such a drastic step' by insisting that its own residents shall have a share in devising and safeguarding protection against its local hazards. La Tourette v. McMaster, 248 U. S. 465. All these are questions of policy not for us to judge. For it can never be emphasized too much that one’s own opinion as to the wisdom of a law must be wholly excluded when one is doing one’s judicial duty. The limit of our inquiry is reached when we conclude that Virginia has exerted its powers as to matters within the bounds of her control. In reaching this conclusion we have been duly mindful of the cases urged upon us by appellants. In Allgeyer v. Louisiana, 165 U. S. 578, apart from the doubts that have been cast upon the opinion in that case, the state attempted to penalize the making of contracts by its residents outside its borders with companies which had never subjected themselves to local control. Thus the statute *67was thought to be directed not at the regulation of insurance within the state, but at the making of contracts without. This was followed in St. Louis Compress Co. v. Arkansas, 260 U. S. 346; but see the refined distinctions drawn in Compañia de Tabacos v. Collector, 275 U. S. 87. In Fidelity & Deposit Co. v. Tafoya, supra, the Court found that New Mexico had exceeded its power by forbidding “the payment of any emolument of any nature to any [non-resident] for the obtaining, placing or writing of any policy covering risks in New Mexico.” The Court was of opinion that this statute went “beyond any legitimate interest of the State, . . .” ibid. at 435, but carefully withheld its judgment as to the validity of a later New Mexico statute not unlike the Virginia law here under review.7 The decree must be Affirmed. The relevant portions of the Virginia statute are as follows: “Section 4222. ... (a) Insurance companies, legally authorized to do business in this State, except life, title and ocean marine insurance companies, shall not make contracts of insurance or surety on persons or property herein, except through regularly constituted and registered resident agents or agencies of such companies; no contract of insurance or surety covering persons or property in this State, except contracts of life, title and ocean marine insurance and except temporary binders covering other forms of insurance shall be written, issued or delivered by any such authorized insurance company, or any of its representatives, unless such contract is duly countersigned in writing by a resident agent or agency of such company; provided, however, that the countersignature of an insurance agency shall not be considered valid unless such countersignature be attested to in writing by a regularly constituted and registered resident agent of such company. “No State agent, special agent, company representative, salaried officer, manager or other salaried representative of any legally authorized insurance company, except a mutual insurance company, shall countersign any contract of insurance or surety, or any renewal thereof, covering persons or property in this State, except contracts of life, title and ocean marine insurance; provided that this section *60shall not apply to railroad companies and other common carriers engaged in interstate commerce. “Section 4226-a. ... No resident agent or agency may write, countersign, issue or deliver any contract of insurance or surety upon persons or property in this State unless there shall be collected at the time the contract is written, issued or delivered, or within a reasonable time thereafter, the full premium on such contract, and the resident agent or agency shall be entitled to and shall receive the usual and customary- commissions allowed on such contracts, provided that such resident agent or agency may write such contracts at the request only of such other resident agents or agencies, when such agent or agencies are properly licensed to transact the class of business involved in such exchange, and licensed non-resident insurance brokers who may be authorized by law to broker such contracts, and on exchange of business between resident agents or agencies in Virginia and licensed non-resident insurance brokers in other states the resident agent or agency in Virginia may allow or pay to such licensed non-resident insurance brokers, a commission not exceeding fifty per centum of the resident agent’s or agency’s commission allowed on such business.” Where out-of-state “production” actually leads to rebating in defiance of § 4222-c, there would seem little'doubt of a substantial basis for Virginia's contention that the requirement of participation by a resident agent will make the illegal practices more susceptible of detection and control. Cf. La Tourette v. McMaster, 248 U. S. 465. Virginia has also contended that the master policy makes it possible for the companies to reduce their rates below the requirements of state law, and to attribute the reductions to risks in other states with requirements less stringent than those of Virginia. Appellants strenuously contend that no law of Virginia prohibits the reduction of rates for out-of-state risks to compensate for the higher rates which might be required by Virginia and, therefore, there is no illegal practice in this connection which the existence of a resident agent could aid in uncovering. This argument, if met on the merits, would lead us into the particularities of Virginia's rate laws. It is enough to say that even if these practices are not illegal, Virginia *64may have a legitimate interest in discovering the extent of their prevalence in order to devise, if she so chooses, effective laws to prevent them.

But even if the broker does “service” the contract, his activities will take place in Virginia, and will affect the welfare of those inside Virginia who may be subject to the incidence of those risks which the “servicing” function tends to reduce. If this be true, it is Virginia’s concern and not ours to prefer the agency to the brokerage method of “production.” Alabama Code, § 8379; Kansas, General Statute (Supp.), c. 40, § 246; Louisiana, Acts of 1918, No. 153; Maryland, Annotated Code, Art. 48A, § 65; Mississippi, Code, § 5205; Montana, Laws of 1937, c. 95; Oklahoma, Statutes Ann., Title 36, §§ 126, 142, 249; South Carolina, Code, § 7972; South Dakota, Code, § 31.2218; Washington, Rev. Statutes, § 7080; Wisconsin, Statutes, § 201.44; Wyoming, Rev. Statutes, c. 57, § 203. See Gephart, Principles of Insurance, pp. 233-55; Dawson, Insurance Legislation (1895); Abstract of the Laws of Virginia in Relation to Insurance Companies, etc., issued by the Auditor of Public Accounts (1878); Patterson, The Insurance Commissioner in the United States. Hartford Indemnity Co. v. Delta Co., 292 U. S. 143, resting on Home Ins. Co. v. Dick, 281 U. S. 397, held that the terms of a contract validly made in Tennessee could not be subsequently enlarged by Mississippi as to a condition of “substantial importance” when suit was later brought on the policy in Mississippi, simply because “the interest insured was in Mississippi when the obligation to indemnify . . . matured, and it was . . . [the company’s] duty to make payment there.” 292 U. S. at 149. At the time the contract was entered into Mississippi had no interest in the risk covered. The Court felt that, even at the time of suit, “performance at most involved only the casual payment of money in Mississippi,” ibid, at 150, and that was an interest so subordinate to that of Tennessee that the latter was entitled to have the right of way. No question was thus involved touching the right of a state to regulate companies doing business within its borders as to contracts of insurance covering local risks.  \n",

I think it sanctions an exertion of power by Virginia over transactions beyond her jurisdiction. *68Virginia may, of course, regulate the making of contracts of insurance within her borders. She may require such contracts to embody specified provisions. She may regulate the enforcement of these contracts in her courts. She may supervise and condition the activities of registered foreign insurance companies, agents or brokers within the Commonwealth. The statute in question has no such purpose. The purpose and effect of the statute are to compel an insurance company which is a citizen of another state, and which negotiates a contract of insurance with an agent or broker within such other state, to pay a resident of Virginia for a service not rendered by him, but rendered by another in another state. By force of the statute a Virginia agent must countersign a contract negotiated outside of Virginia with an assured whose residence is outside of Virginia, which contract of insurance was negotiated by an agent or broker living outside of Virginia. The countersigning Virginia agent must be paid one-half the usual commission, even though the broker or agent who produced the business is licensed as a non-resident broker by Virginia, although the only service such Virginia agent is required to render and, in many cases all he does render, is the mere countersignature of the policy. With respect to this situation the court below said: ■ “We do not overlook the peculiar situation of the nonresident assured who form no part of the Virginia public which the state desires to protect. Undoubtedly their business methods will be disturbed by the enforcement of the statute. It is contended, not without merit, that they have no need for the services of the resident commission agents, and that in fact, the latter cannot assume the function of producing agents in their behalf without harmfully intruding themselves into confidential business affairs. Moreover, it is fair to say that these affairs are so important and so widespread in their scope as to be *69beyond the technical knowledge and skill of the average Virginia agent, and that the interests of the non-resident assureds can be best looked after by the brokers at the great centers of population where the head offices of the insurance companies and of the assureds are located, and in Virginia by the engineering and claim personnel of the companies. It is also true that the substantial compensation required by the statute to be paid to the Virginia agents will increase the cost of the business.” The plain effort of Virginia is to compel a nonresident to pay a resident of Virginia for services which the latter does not in fact render and is not required to render. The principles underlying former decisions of this court are at war with the existence of any such asserted power.1 The Chief Justice and  Justice McReynolds join in this opinion. Allgeyer v.

Justice delivered the opinion of the Court. This case presents the question whether regulations embodied in a municipal ordinance abridge the freedom of speech or of the press secured against state invasion by the Fourteenth Amendment. 1 Section 2 of an ordinance of Shasta County, California, provides: “It shall be unlawful for any person, in or upon any public street, highway, sidewalk, alley or other public place in the County of Shasta, State of California, to loiter in front of, or in the vicinity of, or to picket in front of, or in the vicinity of, or to carry, show or display any banner, transparency, badge or sign in front of, or in the vicinity of, any works, or factory, or any place of business or employment, for the purpose of inducing or influencing, or attempting to induce or influence, any person to refrain from entering any such works, or factory, or place of business, or employment, or for the purpose of inducing or influencing, or attempting to induce or influence, any person to refrain from purchasing or using any goods, wares, merchandise, or other articles, manufactured, made or kept for sale therein, or for the purpose of inducing or influencing, or attempting to induce or influence, any person to refrain from doing or performing any service or labor in any works, factory, place of business or employment, or for the purpose of intimidating, threatening or coercing, or attempting to intimidate, threaten or coerce any person who is performing, seeking or obtaining service or labor in any such works, factory, place of business or employment.” 2 *110 Appellant was one of a group of twenty-nme men engaged in “picketing” on U. S. Highway 99 in front of the Delta Tunnel Project in Shasta County. “The picketing consisted of walking [on the edge of the highway nearest the project] a distance of 50 to 100 feet in a general northerly direction, then turning around and retracing steps and continuing as before ... all of the walking in connection with the picketing . . . was done off the paved portion of the highway and on the gravelled portion of the right-of-way, that is, on public property.” Some of the pickets carried signs, similar to those described in the margin, 3 in such a manner that workers on the project and persons going along the highway in either direction could read them. The sign carried by appellant bore the legend: “This job is unfair to CIO.” These activities occurred between the hours of 7:30 and 9:00 a. m. During this period vehicles and persons passed freely without any molestation or interference through the picket line from the highway to the project and from the project to the highway, and the traffic of persons and automobiles along the highway was not obstructed. Appellant did not threaten or intimidate or coerce anyone, did not make any loud noises at any time, and was peaceful and orderly in his demeanor. The *111 pickets committed no acts of violence, and there was no breach of the peace. The county officers arrested appellant and charged that he did “loiter, picket, and display signs and banners in a public place and in and upon a public highway in front of, and in the vicinity of the Delta Tunnel Project . . . for the purpose of inducing and influencing persons to refrain from doing and performing services and labor” at the project in violation of the ordinance. The Justice’s Court of Township Number Nine found him “guilty of violating the Shasta County Anti-Picketing Law,” rendered judgment accordingly, and imposed sentence. The Superior Court of Shasta County affirmed the judgment. That court upheld the ordinance, over appellant’s claim of unconstitutionality, on the authority of a prior decision. 4 The case comes here on appeal. 5 Our decision in Thornhill v. Alabama, ante, p. 88, goes far toward settling the issues presented here. Under that decision, § 2 of the ordinance in question is to be judged upon its face. 6 Section 2 on its face declares it unlawful for any person to carry or display any sign or banner or badge in the vicinity of any place of business for the purpose of inducing or attempting to induce any person to refrain from purchasing merchandise or performing services or labor. It likewise makes it unlawful for any person to loiter or *112 picket in the vicinity of any place of business for a similar purpose. The terms \"loiter” and “picket” are not defined either in the ordinance or in authoritative state decisions. Therefore, they must be judged as covering all the activities embraced by the prohibition against the carrying of signs in the vicinity of a labor dispute for the purpose mentioned. 7 The ordinance does not proscribe the carrying of signs in other places or for the purpose of inducing or attempting to induce others to adopt courses of action not related to labor disputes. It contains no exceptions with respect to the truthfulness and restraint of the information conveyed or the number of persons engaged in the activity. It is true that the ordinance requires proof of a purpose to persuade others not to buy merchandise or perform services. Such a purpose could be found in the case of nearly every person engaged in publicizing the facts of a labor dispute; every employee or member of a union who engaged in such activity in the vicinity of a place of business could be found desirous of accomplishing such objectives; disinterested persons (who might be hired to carry signs) appear to be a possible, but unlikely, exception. 8 In brief, the ordinance does not regulate all carrying of signs, but, on the contrary, proscribes the carrying of signs only if by persons directly interested who approach the vicinity of a labor dispute to convey information about the dispute. The sweeping and inexact terms of the ordinance disclose the threat to freedom of speech inherent in its existence. It cannot be thought to differ in any material respect from the statute held void in Thornhill’s case. The carrying of signs and banners, no less than the raising of a flag, is a natural and appropriate means of convey *113 ing information on matters of public concern. Stromberg v. California, 283 U. S. 359. For the reasons set forth in our opinion in Thornhill v. Alabama, supra, publicizing the facts of a labor dispute in a peaceful way through appropriate means, whether by pamphlet, by word of mouth or by banner, must now be regarded as within that liberty of communication which is secured to every person by the Fourteenth Amendment against abridgment by a State. The power and duty of the State to take adequate steps to preserve the peace and protect the privacy, the lives, and the property of its residents cannot be doubted. But the ordinance in question here abridges liberty of discussion under circumstances presenting no clear and present danger of substantive evils within the allowable area of state control. Reversed. Me. Justice McReynolds is of opinion that the judgment below should be affirmed. 1 “It is also well settled that municipal ordinances adopted under state authority constitute state action and are within the prohibition of the amendment.” Lovell v. Griffin, 303 U. S. 444, 450; Schneider v. State, 308 U. S. 147. 2 Section 1 declares that it shall be unlawful for any person “to make any loud or unusual noise, or to speak in a loud or unusual *110 tone, or to cry out or proclaim, for the purposes of inducing or influencing, or attempting to induce or influence, any person” to refrain from entering, or purchasing merchandise from, or performing any service in, any place of business. The State did not charge that this section was violated. 3 Four signs were admitted in evidence as typical. They were of white card board, approximately 14 x 22 inches in size, and were tacked upon a stick some 34 inches long, 1% inches wide and % inch thick. Black painted letters, ranging in' size from iy2 inches to 5 inches in height, spelled out one of the following legends on each sign: “Don’t be a scab,” “Shasta Tunnel and Construction Workers Local #260,” “CIO Picket Line,” “This job unfair to CIO.” 4 Appellant, prior to trial, moved to dismiss the complaint upon a number of grounds, among which was the contention that § 2 of the ordinance violated the Fourteenth Amendment in abridging his “freedom of speech, freedom of press, and freedom of assembly.” The same objections were raised by demurrer, by further motions to dismiss the complaint, and by motion in arrest of judgment. 5 There is no further appeal allowed in the state courts. 6 We do not decide whether, in view of the separability provision (§ 3), the state courts might cull out from § 2 particular clauses which, standing alone, could be sustained. 7 See Thornhill v. Alabama, ante, p. 101, n. 18. 8 Even they would be covered under a construction malting purpose synonymous with intent. See Thornhill v. Alabama, ante, p. 100, n. 17.  \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       356 U.S. 274 (1958) FIDELITY-PHILADELPHIA TRUST CO. ET AL., EXECUTORS, v. SMITH, COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE. No. 130. Supreme Court of United States. Argued January 30, 1958. Decided April 28, 1958. CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT. *275 Robert T. McCracken argued the cause for petitioners. With him on the brief was John B. Leake. Myron C. Baum argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief were Solicitor General Rankin, Assistant Attorney General Rice and Harry Baum.  CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN delivered the opinion of the Court. The question before the Court is whether the proceeds of certain insurance policies on the life of the decedent, payable to named beneficiaries and irrevocably assigned by the insured, should be included in the estate of the decedent for the purposes of the federal estate tax. The facts are not in dispute. In 1934 decedent, then aged 76, purchased a series of annuity-life insurance policy combinations. Three single-premium life insurance policies, at face values of $200,000, $100,000, and $50,000, respectively, were obtained without the requirement of a medical examination. As a condition to selling decedent each life insurance policy, the companies involved required decedent also to purchase a separate, single-premium, nonrefundable life annuity policy. The premiums for each life insurance policy and for each annuity policy were fixed at regular rates. The size of each annuity, however, was calculated so that in the event the annuitant-insured died prematurely the annuity premium, less the amount allocated to annuity payments already made, would combine with the companion life insurance premium, plus interest, to equal the amount of insurance proceeds to be paid.[1] Each annuity policy could have *276 been purchased without the insurance policy for the same premium charged for it under the annuity-life insurance combination. The decedent's children were primary beneficiaries of the insurance policies; the Fidelity-Philadelphia Trust Company, as trustee of a trust established by decedent, was named beneficiary of the interests of any of decedent's children who predeceased her. In the year of purchase, decedent assigned all rights and benefits under two of the life insurance policies to her children and under the other to the Fidelity-Philadelphia Trust Company as trustee. These rights and benefits included the rights to receive dividends, to change the beneficiaries, to surrender the policies, and to assign them. Dividends were received, but, as far as the record discloses, none of the other rights was exercised. A gift tax on these transfers was paid by the decedent in 1935. In 1938 decedent amended the above-mentioned trust so that it became irrevocable. As the Government concedes, the decedent retained no beneficial or reversionary interest in the trust. The insured died in 1946. The proceeds of the three insurance policies were not included in her estate in the estate tax return. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue determined that these proceeds should have been included and assessed a deficiency accordingly. The adjusted tax was paid by the executors, and when claim for refund was denied, this action for refund followed. The District Court entered judgment for the taxpayers, but the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed. 241 F.2d 690. We granted certiorari.[2] 354 U.S. 921. *277 It is conceded by the parties that the question of whether the proceeds should be included in the estate is not determinable by the federal estate tax provision dealing with life insurance proceeds. Cf. Helvering v. Le Gierse, 312 U.S. 531. To support the decision below, the Government argues that the proceeds are includible in the estate under Section 811 (c) (1) (B) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, which includes, in the estate of the decedent, property, to the extent of the decedent's interest therein, which the decedent had transferred without adequate and full consideration, under which transfer the decedent \"has retained for his life . . .(i) the possession or enjoyment of, or the right to income from, the property . . . .\" The Government contends that the annuity payments, which were retained until death, were income from property transferred by the decedent to her children through the use of the life insurance policies. On the other hand, petitioners, executors of the estate, assert that the annuity payments were income from the annuity policies, which were separate property from the insurance policies, and that since decedent had assigned away the life insurance policies before death, she retained no interest in them at death. The Government relies on Helvering v. Le Gierse, supra, where this Court also had before it the issue of the taxability of proceeds from a life insurance policy in an annuity-life insurance combination. After holding that the taxability of these proceeds was not to be determined for estate tax purposes according to the statutory provisions dealing with life insurance,[3] the Court held that *278 the proceeds were includible in the estate under Section 302 (c) of the Revenue Act of 1926 because they devolved on the beneficiaries in a transfer which took \"effect in possession or enjoyment at or after . . . death.\" 312 U.S., at 542. However, in reaching this conclusion the decision did not consider the problem in the case at bar, for in Le Gierse the insured had retained the rights and benefits of the insurance policy until death. The facts in the instant case on this point are fundamentally different. Prior to death, the decedent had divested herself of all interests in the insurance policies, including the possibility that the funds would return to her or her estate if the beneficiaries predeceased her.[4] The assignees became the \"owners\" of the policies before her death; they had received the right to the immediate and unlimited use of the policies to the full extent of their worth. The immediate value of the policies was always substantial. In the year of assignment their total cash surrender value was over $289,000; in the year of death it was over $326,000. Under the assignment, the decedent had not *279 become a life tenant who postpones the possession and enjoyment of the property by the remaindermen until her death.[5] Cf. Helvering v. Bullard, 303 U.S. 297; Commissioner v. Estate of Church, 335 U.S. 632. On the contrary, the assignees held the bundle of rights, the incidents of ownership, over property from which the decedent had totally divorced herself. Cf. Chase National Bank v. United States, 278 U.S. 327; Goldstone v. United States, 325 U.S. 687. Illustrative of the distinction between Helvering v. Le Gierse and the case at bar is the fact that the Government has not endeavored here to sustain the tax under the statutory provision applied in that case. Instead of the provision taxing transfers \"intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after\" the transferor's death,[6] the provision applied in Le Gierse, the Government relies on the provision taxing transfers in which the transferor has retained until death \"the right to income from\" the transferred property.[7] However, the Government's position that the annuities were income from property *280 which the insured transferred to her children under the life insurance policies is not well taken. To establish its contention, the Government must aggregate the premiums of the annuity policies with those of the life insurance policies and establish that the annuity payments were derived as income from the entire investment. This proposition cannot be established. Admittedly, when the policies were purchased, each life insurance-annuity combination was the product of a single, integrated transaction. However, the parties neither intended that, nor acted as if, any of the transactions would have a quality of indivisibility. Regardless of the considerations prompting the insurance companies to hedge their life insurance contracts with annuities, each time an annuity-life insurance combination was written, two items of property, an annuity policy and an insurance policy, were transferred to the purchaser. The annuity policy could have been acquired separately, and the life insurance policy could have been, and was, conveyed separately. The annuities arose from personal obligations of the insurance companies which were in no way conditioned on the continued existence of the life insurance contracts. These periodic payments would have continued unimpaired and without diminution in size throughout the life of the insured even if the life insurance policies had been extinguished.[8] Quite clearly the *281 annuity payments arose solely from the annuity policies. The use and enjoyment of the annuity policies were entirely independent of the life insurance policies. Because of this independence, the Commissioner may not, by aggregating the two types of policies into one investment, conclude that by receiving the annuities, the decedent had retained income from the life insurance contracts.[9] Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is Reversed.  JUSTICE BURTON, with whom  JUSTICE BLACK and  JUSTICE CLARK join, dissenting. For the reasons stated by the court below, 241 F.2d 690, and also in Conway v. Glenn, 193 F.2d 965, and Burr v. Commissioner, 156 F.2d 871, it seems to me that, for federal estate tax purposes, this case is indistinguishable from one in which a settlor places a sum in trust under such terms that he shall receive the income from it for life, and the principal shall be payable to designated beneficiaries upon his death. As the principal, in that event, would be includable in the settlor's estate for federal estate tax purposes, so here the proceeds of the insurance policies should be included in this decedent's estate. Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals. NOTES [1] Of course, an additional amount is added to the premiums to compensate the insurance companies for expenses. [2] In agreement with the decision below are Burr v. Commissioner, 156 F.2d 871 (C. A. 2d Cir.), and Conway v. Glenn, 193 F.2d 965 (C. A. 6th Cir.). To the contrary is Bohnen v. Harrison, 199 F.2d 492 (C. A. 7th Cir.), affirmed by an equally divided Court, 345 U.S. 946. [3] Section 302 (g) of the Revenue Act of 1926, 44 Stat. 9, 71, exempted from the estate proceeds up to $40,000 \"receivable . . . as insurance\" by persons other than the executor. The proceeds in Helvering v. Le Gierse were not considered to have arisen from \"insurance\" as Congress meant the word to be used because the ordinary \"insurance risk\" was not present. The insurance company had not undertaken to shift the risk of premature death from the insured and to distribute the risk among its other policyholders. On the contrary, by requiring a concurrent purchase of a nonrefundable annuity contract, the company had neutralized the risk at the expense of the \"insured.\" The remaining risk, whether the annuitant would live beyond the actuarial prediction and after the insurance policy had been surrendered, was considered not an insurance risk but a risk of ordinary investment. Cf. Meisenholder, Taxation of Annuity Contracts under Estate and Inheritance Taxes, 39 Mich. L. Rev. 856, 883. The principle that the proceeds are not considered \"receivable. . . as insurance\" applies whether at death the rights and benefits of the policies are in the hands of the insured or of another person. Goldstone v. United States, 325 U.S. 687, 690. [4] Cf. Goldstone v. United States, supra. [5] Nor are the assignees like second annuitants in survivorship annuities or joint annuitants in joint and survivor annuities. The donor's and donee's annuities have a common fund as the source so that if the source of the donor's annuity is extinguished, the donee's annuity is destroyed. The entire economic enjoyment of the second annuitant must, realistically speaking, await the death of the first annuitant, and a substantial portion of the surviving joint annuitant's enjoyment is similarly postponed. Cf., e. g., Commissioner v. Wilder's Estate, 118 F.2d 281; Commissioner v. Clise, 122 F.2d 998; Mearkle's Estate v. Commissioner, 129 F.2d 386.

[8] Where a decedent, not in contemplation of death, has transferred property to another in return for a promise to make periodic payments to the transferor for his lifetime, it has been held that these payments are not income from the transferred property so as to include the property in the estate of the decedent. E. g., Estate of Sarah A. Bergan, 1 T.C. 543, Acq., 1943 Cum. Bull. 2; Security Trust & Savings Bank, Trustee, 11 B. T. A. 833; Seymour Johnson, 10 B. T. A. 411; Hirsh v. United States, 68 Ct. Cl. 508, 35 F.2d 982 (Ct. Cl. 1929); cf. Welch v. Hall, 134 F.2d 366. In these cases the promise is a personal obligation of the transferee, the obligation is usually not chargeable to the transferred property, and the size of the payments is not determined by the size of the actual income from the transferred property at the time the payments are made.

Meredith, 1 T.C. M. 847, affirmed, Helvering v. Meredith, 140 F.2d 973; John Koehrer, 4 T.C. M. 219.  \n",

UNITED STATES. No. 489. Supreme Court of United States. Argued April 28, 1959. Decided June 22, 1959.[*] CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT. Leland Hazard argued the cause for petitioner in No. 489. With him on the brief were Cyrus v. Anderson and James B. Henry, Jr. *396 H. Graham Morison argued the cause for petitioners in No. 491. With him on the brief were Samuel K. Abrams and Robert M. Lichtman. Philip Elman argued the causes for the United States. On the brief were Solicitor General Rankin, Assistant Attorney General Hansen, Daniel M. Friedman, Richard A. Solomon, Samuel Karp and Ernest L. Folk III.  JUSTICE CLARK delivered the opinion of the Court. Petitioners stand convicted on a single-count indictment charging a conspiracy under § 1 of the Sherman Act. They contend that the trial judge erred in refusing to permit them to inspect the grand jury minutes covering the testimony before that body of a key government witness at the trial. The Court of Appeals affirmed the convictions, 260 F.2d 397. With reference to the present claim, it held that Rule 6 (e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure[1] committed the inspection or not of grand jury minutes to the sound discretion of the trial judge, *397 and that in this instance, no abuse of that discretion had been shown. We granted certiorari limited to the question posed by this ruling. 358 U.S. 917, 918. We conclude that in the circumstances of this case the trial court did not err in refusing to make Jonas' grand jury testimony available to petitioners for use in cross-examination. The indictment returned in the case named as defendants seven corporations, all manufacturers of mirrors, and three of their officers. However, only three of the corporations are petitioners here, along with one individual, J. A. Messer, Sr. The indictment charged a conspiracy to fix the price of plain plate glass mirrors sold in interstate commerce. It is not necessary for our purposes to detail the facts of this long trial, the record of which covers 860 pages. It is sufficient to say that the Government proved its case through 10 witnesses, the last of whom was Jonas. He was President of a large North Carolina mirror manufacturing company and had a reputation for independence in the industry. Although neither he nor his corporation was indicted, the latter was made a co-conspirator. The evidence indicates that the conspiracy was consummated at two meetings held on successive days during the week of the annual meeting of the Mirror Manufacturers Association in 1954 at Asheville, North Carolina. Jonas, not being a member of the Association, did not attend the convention. Talk at the convention regarding prices culminated in telephone calls by several representatives of mirror manufacturers to Jonas concerning his attitude on raising prices. On the day following these calls Jonas and three of the participants in the conspiracy met at an inn away from the convention headquarters and discussed \"prices.\" Within three days thereafter each of the manufacturers announced an identical price increase, which was approximately 10 percent. Jonas' testimony, of course, was confined to the telephone calls and the meeting at the inn *398 where the understanding was finalized. The Government admits that he was an \"important\" witness. However, proof of the conspiracy was overwhelming aside from Jonas' testimony. While he was the only witness who characterized the outcome of the meetings as an \"agreement\" on prices, no witness negatived this conclusion and the identical price lists that followed the meeting at the inn were little less than proof positive. After the conclusion of Jonas' testimony, defense counsel interrogated him as to the number of times he appeared and the subject of his testimony before the grand jury. Upon ascertaining that Jonas had testified three times on \"the same general subject matter,\" counsel moved for the delivery of the grand jury minutes. He stated that the petitioners had \"a right . . . to inspect the Grand Jury record of the testimony of this witness after he has completed his direct examination\" relating to \"the same general subject matter\" as his trial testimony.[2] As authority for \"the automatic delivery of Grand Jury transcripts\" under such circumstances counsel cited Jencks v. United States, 353 U.S. 657 (1957). As previously indicated, the motion was denied. It appears to us clear that Jencks v. United States, supra, is in nowise controlling here. It had nothing to do with grand jury proceedings and its language was not intended to encompass grand jury minutes. Likewise, it is equally clear that Congress intended to exclude those minutes from the operation of the so-called Jencks Act, 71 Stat. 595, 18 U.S. C. (Supp. V, 1958) § 3500.[3] Petitioners concede, as they must, that any disclosure of grand jury minutes is covered by Fed. Rules Crim. Proc. 6 (e) promulgated by this Court in 1946 after the *399 approval of Congress. In fact, the federal trial courts as well as the Courts of Appeals have been nearly unanimous in regarding disclosure as committed to the discretion of the trial judge.[4] Our cases announce the same principle,[5] and Rule 6 (e) is but declaratory of it.[6] As recently as last Term we characterized cases where grand jury minutes are used \"to impeach a witness, to refresh his recollection, to test his credibility and the like\" as instances of \"particularized need where the secrecy of the proceedings is lifted discretely and limitedly.\" United States v. Procter & Gamble, 356 U.S. 677, 683 (1958). Petitioners argue, however, that the trial judge's discretion under Rule 6 (e) must be exercised in accordance with the rationale of Jencks; namely, upon a showing on cross-examination that a trial witness testified before the grand juryand nothing morethe defense has a \"right\" to the delivery to it of the witness' grand jury testimony. This conclusion, however, runs counter to \"a long-established policy\" of secrecy, United States v. Procter & Gamble, supra, at 681, older than our Nation itself. The reasons therefor are manifold, id., at 682, and are compelling when viewed in the light of the history and modus operandi of the grand jury. Its establishment in the Constitution \"as the sole method for preferring charges in serious criminal cases\" indeed \"shows the high place it [holds] as an instrument of justice.\" Costello v. United States, 350 U.S. 359, 362 (1956). Ever since this action *400 by the Fathers, the American grand jury, like that of England, \"has convened as a body of laymen, free from technical rules, acting in secret, pledged to indict no one because of prejudice and to free no one because of special favor.\" Ibid. Indeed, indictments may be returned on hearsay, or for that matter, even on the knowledge of the grand jurors themselves. Id., at 362, 363. To make public any part of its proceedings would inevitably detract from its efficacy. Grand jurors would not act with that independence required of an accusatory and inquisitorial body. Moreover, not only would the participation of the jurors be curtailed, but testimony would be parsimonious if each witness knew that his testimony would soon be in the hands of the accused. Especially is this true in antitrust proceedings where fear of business reprisal might haunt both the grand juror and the witness. And this \"go slow\" sign would continue as realistically at the time of trial as theretofore. It does not follow, however, that grand jury minutes should never be made available to the defense. This Court has long held that there are occasions, see United States v. Procter & Gamble, supra, at 683, when the trial judge may in the exercise of his discretion order the minutes of a grand jury witness produced for use on his cross-examination at trial. Certainly \"disclosure is wholly proper where the ends of justice require it.\" United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., supra, at 234. The burden, however, is on the defense to show that \"a particularized need\" exists for the minutes which outweighs the policy of secrecy. We have no such showing here. As we read the record the petitioners failed to show any need whatever for the testimony of the witness Jonas. They contended only that they had a \"right\" to the transcript because it dealt with subject matter generally covered at the trial. Petitioners indicate that the trial judge required a showing of contradiction *401 between Jonas' trial and grand jury testimony. Such a preliminary showing would not, of course, be necessary. While in a colloquy with counsel the judge did refer to such a requirement, we read his denial as being based on the breadth of petitioners' claim. Petitioners also claim error because the trial judge failed to examine the transcript himself for any inconsistencies. But we need not consider that problem because petitioners made no such request of the trial judge. The Court of Appeals apparently was of the view that even if the trial judge had been requested to examine the transcript he would not have been absolutely required to do so. It is contended here that the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has reached a contrary conclusion. United States v. Spangelet, 258 F.2d 338. Be that as it may, resolution of that question must await a case where the issue is presented by the record. The short of it is that in the present case the petitioners did not invoke the discretion of the trial judge, but asserted a supposed absolute right, a right which we hold they did not have. The judgment is therefore. Affirmed.  JUSTICE BRENNAN, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE,  JUSTICE BLACK and  JUSTICE DOUGLAS join, dissenting. In the words of the Court of Appeals, Jonas was the Government's \"principal prosecuting witness.\"[1] He was President of Lenoir Mirror Company, which company was *402 a participant in the alleged price-fixing conspiracy, but was not indicted. After Jonas testified on direct examination defense counsel asked for the production of his relevant grand jury testimony. The trial judge immediately made clear his intention not to grant the motion: \"Unless you can show some sound basis that contradicts between what happened in the Grand Jury room and his testimony before the Grand Jury and his testimony in this trial, I am not going to require the production of the Grand Jury records. It would be easy for any attorney to get access to the records of the Grand Jury by just such a motion as you are making here.\" Defense counsel protested, \"we are not attempting that. We want just a transcript of his testimony before the Grand Jury regarding the subjects to which he has testified on direct examination.\" (Emphasis supplied.) This request thus encompassed all of Jonas' grand jury testimony only if all of that testimony covered the subject matter of Jonas' trial testimony. The court replied, \"You have stated what you want to ask him and I am denying your right to do it.\" Plainly defense counsel were not asking to see the minutes of the entire grand jury proceedings, nor even of all of Jonas' testimony before the grand jury unless all of it was on the same subject matter as his trial testimony. Their motion was carefully limited to a request for so much of Jonas' grand jury testimony as \"covered the substance of his testimony on direct examination.\" This request that secrecy be \"lifted discretely and limitedly,\" United States v. Procter & Gamble, 356 U.S. 677, 683, necessarily implied a request that the trial judge inspect the grand jury minutes and turn over to the defense only those parts dealing with Jonas' testimony on the same subject matter as his trial testimony. In this posture, then, the question for our decision is the narrow one whether the trial judge erred in denying the defense request for inspection of the grand jury testimony of a *403 key government witness which covered the subject matter of that witness' trial testimony.[2] I dissent from the Court's affirmance of the trial judge's ruling denying this carefully circumscribed request. Grand jury secrecy is, of course, not an end in itself. Grand jury secrecy is maintained to serve particular ends. But when secrecy will not serve those ends or when the advantages gained by secrecy are outweighed by a countervailing interest in disclosure, secrecy may and should be lifted, for to do so in such a circumstance would further the fair administration of criminal justice. See McNabb v. United States, 318 U.S. 332. It is true that secrecy is not to be lifted without a showing of good reason, but it is too late in the day to say, as the Court as a practical matter does here, that the Government may insist upon grand jury secrecy even when the possible prejudice to the accused in a criminal case is crystal clear and none of the reasons justifying secrecy is present. \"[A]fter the grand jury's functions are ended, disclosure is wholly proper where the ends of justice require it.\" United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 310 U.S. 150, 234. Thus grand jury minutes have been made available to a defendant accused of committing perjury before the grand jury so that he could adequately prepare his defense, United States v. Remington, 191 F.2d 246; United States v. Rose, 215 F.2d 617, and to a defendant who can show an inconsistency between the trial testimony and grand jury testimony of a government witness, United States v. Alper, 156 F.2d 222; Burton v. United States, 175 F.2d 960; Herzog v. United States, 226 F.2d 561; United States v. H. J. K. Theatre Corp., 236 F.2d 502. On occasion the Government itself has recognized the fairness of permitting the defense access to the grand jury testimony of *404 government witnesses even though it considered that it was not bound to do so, United States v. Grunewald, 162 F. Supp. 621. This Court has implied that grand jury minutes would be discoverable by a defendant in a civil antitrust suit instituted by the Government on a showing of \"particularized need,\" United States v. Procter & Gamble, 356 U.S. 677, 683.[3] Nor can we overlook that the Government uses grand jury minutes to further its own interests in litigation. It is apparently standard practice for government attorneys to use grand jury minutes in preparing a case for trial, see United States v. Procter & Gamble, 356 U.S. 677, 678, in refreshing the recollection of government witnesses at trial, see United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 310 U.S. 150, 233, and, when the need arises, in impeaching witnesses at trial, see United States v. Cotter, 60 F.2d 689. Of course, when the Government uses grand jury minutes at trial the defense is ordinarily entitled to inspect the relevant testimony in those minutes. United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 310 U.S. 150, 233; United States v. Cotter, 60 F.2d 689. Indeed, Rule 6 (e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal *405 Procedure itself recognizes that grand jury testimony is discoverable under appropriate circumstances.[4] The Court apparently agrees with the conclusion compelled by these precedents, for its opinion states that grand jury minutes are discoverable when \" `a particularized need' exists for the minutes which outweighs the policy of secrecy.\" But the Court pays only lip service to the principle in view of the result in this case. It is clear beyond question, I think, that the application of that principle to this case requires a holding that Jonas' grand jury testimony is discoverable to the limited extent sought. Since there are no valid considerations which militate in favor of grand jury secrecy in this case, simple justice requires that the petitioners be given access to the relevant portions of Jonas' grand jury testimony so that they have a fair opportunity to refute the Government's case. Essentially four reasons have been advanced as justification for grand jury secrecy.[5] (1) To prevent the accused from escaping before he is indicted and arrested or from tampering with the witnesses against him. (2) To prevent disclosure of derogatory information presented to the grand jury against an accused who has not been indicted. (3) To encourage complainants and witnesses to come before the grand jury and speak freely without fear that their testimony will be made public thereby subjecting them to possible discomfort or retaliation. (4) To encourage the grand jurors to engage in uninhibited investigation and deliberation by barring disclosure of their votes and comments during the proceedings. *406 None of these reasons dictates that Jonas' grand jury testimony, to the limited extent it is sought, should be kept secret. The Court, while making obeisance to \"a long-established policy\" of secrecy, makes no showing whatever how denial of Jonas' grand jury testimony serves any of the purposes justifying secrecy. Certainly disclosure at this stage of the proceedings would not enable the defendants to escape from custody or to tamper with the witness who has already testified against them on direct examination. Certainly, also, protection of an innocent accused who has not been indicted has no bearing on this case. Discovery has been sought only of Jonas' grand jury testimony on the same subject matter as his testimony at trial. This testimony will have condemned someone to whom he did not refer at trial only if he has concealed information at the trial, and this creates the very situation in which it is imperative that the defense have access to the grand jury testimony if we are to adhere to the standards we have set for ourselves to assure the fair administration of criminal justice in the federal courts. Similarly, disclosure of Jonas' relevant grand jury testimony could not produce the apprehended results of retaliation or discomfort which might induce a reluctance in others to testify before grand juries. Jonas has already taken the stand and testified freely in open court against the defendants. His testimony has been extremely damaging. Disclosure of his testimony before the grand jury is hardly likely to result in any embarrassment that his trial testimony has not already produced. \"If he tells the truth, and the truth is the same as he testified before the grand jury, the disclosure of the former testimony cannot possibly bring to him any harm . . . which his testimony on the open trial does not equally tend to produce.\" 8 Wigmore, Evidence (3d ed. 1940), § 2362, at 725. Witnesses before a grand jury necessarily know that once called by the Government to testify at trial they cannot *407 remain secret informants quite apart from whether their grand jury testimony is discoverable. Finally, the defense seeks nothing which would disclose the votes or opinions of any of the grand jurors involved in these proceedings. All that is sought is the relevant testimony of Jonas. If there are questions by grand jurors intertwined with Jonas' testimony disclosure of which would indicate the jurors' opinions or be embarrassing to them, the names of the grand jurors asking the questions can be excised. Cf. United States v. Grunewald, 162 F. Supp. 621. Plainly, then, no reason justifying secrecy of Jonas' relevant grand jury testimony appears. The Court's insistence on secrecy exalts the principle of secrecy for secrecy's sake in the face of obvious possible prejudice to the petitioners' defense against Jonas' seriously damaging testimony on the trial. Surely \"Justice requires no less,\" Jencks v. United States, 353 U.S. 657, 669, than that the defense be permitted every reasonable opportunity to impeach a government witness, and that a criminal conviction not be based on the testimony of untruthful or inaccurate witnesses. The interest of the United States in a criminal prosecution, it must be emphasized, \"is not that it shall win a case, but that justice shall be done.\" Berger v. United States, U. S. 78, 88. Obviously the impeachment of the Government's key witness on the basis of prior inconsistent or contradictory statements made under oath before a grand jury would have an important effect on a trial. Thus it has long been held that a defendant may have access to inconsistent grand jury testimony for use in cross-examination if he can somehow show that an inconsistency between the trial and grand jury testimony exists. United States v. Alper, 156 F.2d 222; Burton v. United States, 175 F.2d 960; Herzog v. United States, 226 F.2d 561; United States v. H. J. K. Theatre Corp., 236 F.2d 502. But in an analogous situation we have pointed *408 out the folly of requiring the defense to show inconsistency between the witness' trial testimony and his previous statements on the same subject matter before it can obtain access to those very statements. In Jencks v. United States, 353 U.S. 657, we said that it offers no protection to permit a defendant to obtain inconsistent statements to impeach a witness unless he may inspect statements to determine if in fact they are inconsistent with the trial testimony. We said in Jencks: \"Requiring the accused first to show conflict between the reports and the testimony is actually to deny the accused evidence relevant and material to his defense. The occasion for determining a conflict cannot arise until after the witness has testified, and unless he admits conflict, as in Gordon, [Gordon v. United States, 344 U.S. 414] the accused is helpless to know or discover conflict without inspecting the reports. A requirement of a showing of conflict would be clearly incompatible with our standards for the administration of criminal justice in the federal courts and must therefore be rejected.\" 353 U.S., at 667-668. The considerations which moved us to lay down this principle as to prior statements of government witnesses made to government agents obviously apply with equal force to the grand jury testimony of a government witness. For the defense will rarely be able to lay a foundation for obtaining grand jury testimony by showing it is inconsistent with trial testimony unless it can inspect the grand jury testimony, and, apparently in recognition of this fact, the Court holds today that a preliminary showing of inconsistency by the defense would not be necessary in order for it to obtain access to relevant grand jury minutes. It is suggested by the Government, however, that rather than permit the defense to inspect the *409 relevant grand jury minutes for possible use on cross-examination, the trial judge should inspect them and turn over to the defense only those portions, if any, that the judge considers would be useful for purposes of impeachment. This procedure has sometimes been utilized in the past as a way to limit discovery of grand jury minutes. See United States v. Alper, 156 F.2d 222; United States v. Consolidated Laundries, 159 F. Supp. 860. But we pointed out in Jencks the serious disadvantages of such a procedure and expressly disapproved of it. We said: \"Flat contradiction between the witness' testimony and the version of the events given in his reports is not the only test of inconsistency. The omission from the reports of facts related at the trial, or a contrast in emphasis upon the same facts, even a different order of treatment, are also relevant to the cross-examining process of testing the credibility of a witness' trial testimony. ..... \". . . We hold . . . that the petitioner is entitled to inspect the reports to decide whether to use them in his defense. Because only the defense is adequately equipped to determine the effective use for purpose of discrediting the Government's witness and thereby furthering the accused's defense, the defense must initially be entitled to see them to determine what use may be made of them. Justice no less.\" 353 U.S., at 667-669. From Jonas' own admission it appears that his grand jury testimony covered the subject matter of his trial testimony. The reasons for permitting the defense counsel rather than the trial judge to decide what parts of that testimony can effectively be used on cross-examination are certainly not less compelling than in regard to the FBI reports involved in Jencks. For grand jury *410 testimony is often lengthy and involved, and it will be extremely difficult for even the most able and experienced trial judge under the pressures of conducting a trial to pick out all of the grand jury testimony that would be useful in impeaching a witness. See United States v. Spangelet, 258 F.2d 338. His task should be completed when he has satisfied himself what part of the grand jury testimony covers the subject matter of the witness' testimony on the trial, and when he has given that part to the defense. Then the defense may utilize the grand jury testimony for impeachment purposes as it may deem advisable in its best interests, subject of course to the applicable rules of evidence. I would reverse the Court of Appeals and order a new trial for failure of the trial judge to order the production of Jonas' relevant grand jury testimony. NOTES [*] Together with No. 491, Galax Mirror Co., Inc., et al. v. United States, also on certiorari to the same Court, argued April 29, 1959. [1] \"Rule 6. The Grand Jury. ..... \"(e) Secrecy of Proceedings and Disclosure. Disclosure of matters occurring before the grand jury other than its deliberations and the vote of any juror may be made to the attorneys for the government for use in the performance of their duties. Otherwise a juror, attorney, interpreter or stenographer may disclose matters occurring before the grand jury only when so directed by the court preliminarily to or in connection with a judicial proceeding or when permitted by the court at the request of the defendant upon a showing that grounds may exist for a motion to dismiss the indictment because of matters occurring before the grand jury. No obligation of secrecy may be imposed upon any person except in accordance with this rule. The court may direct that an indictment shall be kept secret until the defendant is in custody or has given bail, and in that event the clerk shall seal the indictment and no person shall disclose the finding of the indictment except when necessary for the issuance and execution of a warrant or summons.\" [2] The fact that the trial testimony and that before the grand jury included the same \"subjects\" or related to \"the same general subject matter\" is not contested. [3] See S. Rep. No. 981, 85th Cong., 1st Sess.; 103 Cong. Rec. 15933. [4] E. g., United States v. Spangelet, 258 F.2d 338; United States v. Angelet, 255 F.2d 383; United States v.

And see United States v. Procter & Gamble Co., 356 U.S. 677 (1958); United States v. Johnson, 319 U.S. 503, 513 (1943). [6] See Notes of the Advisory Committee on Rules, following Rule 6, Fed. Rules Crim. Proc. [1] Jonas was the only witness to testify that the defendants had actually agreed to a uniform price increase. Furthermore, his testimony was necessary to refute other testimony that the President of petitioner Galax Mirror Co., Inc., had stated that he would follow his pricing policy regardless of what the other manufacturers did. Jonas' testimony was also instrumental in connecting petitioner Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co. to the price-fixing agreement. [2] As the Court points out, discovery of grand jury minutes is not affected by the Jencks statute, 18 U.S. C. (Supp. V) § 3500. [3] United States v. Procter & Gamble, upon which the Court relies, actually is authority for permitting discovery in this case. The Court in that case recognized that grand jury minutes were discoverable where the need outweighed the advantages of secrecy, but held that such was not the case in the circumstances because, unlike this case, Procter & Gamble concerned a demand for a transcript of the entire grand jury proceedings to be used in pretrial preparation of a civil suit. This case, of course, concerns a demand for discovery of a particular witness' relevant testimony for use on cross-examination at trial in a criminal prosecution. The Court specifically stated in Procter & Gamble: \"We do not reach in this case problems concerning the use of the grand jury transcript at the trial to impeach a witness, to refresh his recollection, to test his credibility and the like. Those are cases of particularized need where the secrecy of the proceedings is lifted discretely and limitedly.\" 356 U.S., at 683. [4] See United States v.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        *217 Per Curiam. I Congress has adopted a policy that favors contracting with small businesses owned and controlled by the socially and economically disadvantaged. See § 8(d)(1) of the Small Business Act, as added by §7 of Pub. L. 87-305,75 Stat. 667, and as amended, 15 U. S. C. § 637(d)(1) (1994 ed., Supp. IV). To effectuate that policy, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA), Pub. L. 102-240, § 1003(b), 105 Stat. 1919, which is an appropriations measure for the Department of Transportation (DOT), seeks to direct 10 percent of the contracting funds expended on projects funded in whole or in part by the appropriated funds to transportation projects employing so-called disadvantaged business enterprises. 1 ISTEA § 1003(b)(1). *218 To qualify for that status, the small business must be certified as owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. DOT does not itself conduct certifications, but relies on certifications from two main sources: the Small Business Administration, which certifies businesses for all types of federal procurement programs, and state highway agencies, which certify them for purposes of federally assisted highway projects. The federal regulations governing these certification programs, see 13 CFR pt. 124 (1999) (Small Business Administration); 64 Fed. Reg. 5096-5148 (1999) (to be codified in 49 CFR pt. 26) (DOT for state highway agencies), require that the certifying entity presume to be socially disadvantaged persons who are black, Hispanic, Asian Pacific, Subcontinent Asian, Native Americans, or members of other groups designated from time to time by the Small Business Administration. See 13 CFR § 124.103(b); 64 Fed. Reg. 5136 (§26.67). State highway agencies must in addition presume that women are socially disadvantaged. Ibid. Small businesses owned and controlled by persons who are not members of the preferred groups may also be certified, but only if they can demonstrate social disadvantage. See 13 CFR § 124.103(c); 64 Fed. Reg. 5136-5137 (§ 26.67(d)); id., at 5147-5148 (pt. 26, subpt. D, App. E). Third parties, as well as DOT, may challenge findings of social disadvantage. See 13 CFR § 124.1017(a); 64 Fed. Reg. 5142 (§26.87). II In 1989, DOT awarded the prime contract for a federal highway project in Colorado to Mountain Gravel & Construction Company. The contract included a Subcontractor Compensation Clause — which the Small Business Act requires all *219 federal agencies to include in their prime contracts, see 15 U. S. C. § 637(d) — rewarding the prime contractor for subcontracting with disadvantaged business enterprises, see § 637(d)(4)(E). Petitioner, whose principal is a white man, submitted the low bid on a portion of the project, but Mountain Gravel awarded the subcontract to a company that had previously been certified by the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) as a disadvantaged business enterprise. Petitioner brought suit against various federal officials, alleging that the Subcontractor Compensation Clause, and in particular the race-based presumption that forms its foundation, violated petitioner’s Fifth Amendment right to equal protection. The Tenth Circuit, applying the so-called intermediate scrutiny approved in some of our cases involving classifications on a basis other than race, see Mississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan, 458 U. S. 718 (1982); Craig v. Boren, 429 U. S. 190 (1976), upheld the use of the clause and the presumption. Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Peña, 16 F. 3d 1537 (1994). Because DOT’S use of race-based measures should have been subjected to strict scrutiny, we reversed and remanded for the application of that standard. Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Peña, 515 U. S. 200, 237-239 (1995) (Adarand I). On remand, the District Court for the District of Colorado held that the clause and the presumption failed strict scrutiny because they were not narrowly tailored. Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Peña, 965 F. Supp. 1556 (1997) (Adarand II). Specifically, the court held the presumption that members of the enumerated racial groups are socially disadvantaged to be both overinelusive and underinclusive, because it includes members of those groups who are not disadvantaged and excludes members of other groups who are. Id., at 1580. The District Court enjoined DOT from *220 using the elause and its presumption. 2 Id., at 1584. Respondents appealed to the Tenth Circuit. Shortly thereafter, and while respondents’ appeal was still pending, petitioner filed a second suit in the District Court, this time naming as defendants certain Colorado officials, and challenging (on the same grounds) the State’s use of the federal guidelines in certifying disadvantaged business enterprises for federally assisted projects. Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Romer, Civ. No. 97-K-1351 (June 26, 1997). Shortly after this suit was filed, however, Colorado altered its certification program in response to the District Court's decision in Adarand II. Specifically, the State did away with the presumption of social disadvantage for certain minorities and women, App. to Pet. for Cert. 109-111, and in its place substituted a requirement that all applicants certify on their own account that each of the firm’s majority owners “has experienced social disadvantage based upon the effects of racial, ethnic or gender discrimination,” id., at 110. Colorado requires no further showing of social disadvantage by any applicant. A few days after Colorado amended its certification procedure, the District Court held a hearing on petitioner’s motion for a preliminary injunction in Romer. The District Court took judicial notice of its holding in Adarand II that the Federal Government had discriminated against petitioner’s owner “by the application of unconstitutional rules and regulations.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 136. As a result of that race-based discrimination, the District Court reasoned, petitioner likely was eligible for disadvantaged business status under Colorado’s system for certifying businesses for federally assisted projects — the system at issue in Romer. App. to Pet. for Cert. 137. The District Court therefore denied *221 petitioner’s request for a preliminary injunction. Id., at 138. Petitioner then requested and received disadvantaged business status from CDOT. Meanwhile, respondents’ appeal from the District Court’s decision in Adamnd II was pending before the Tenth Circuit. Upon learning that CDOT had given petitioner disadvantaged business status, the Tenth Circuit held that the cause of action was moot, and vacated the District Court’s judgment favorable to petitioner in Adarand II. 169 F. 3d 1292, 1296-1297, 1299 (CA10 1999). Petitioner filed a petition for certiorari. Ill In dismissing the ease as moot, the Tenth Circuit relied on the language of the Subcontractor Compensation Clause, which provides that “[a] small business concern will be considered a [disadvantaged business enterprise] after it has been certified as such by . . . any State’s Department of Highways/Transportation.” Id., at 1296. Because CDOT had certified petitioner as a disadvantaged business enterprise, the court reasoned, the language of the clause indicated that the Federal Government also had accepted petitioner’s certification for purposes of federal projects. As a result, petitioner could no longer demonstrate “ ‘an invasion of a legally protected interest’ that is sufficiently ‘concrete and particularized’ and ‘actual or imminent’” to establish standing. Arizonans for Official English v. Arizona, 520 U. S. 43, 64 (1997) (quoting Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555, 560 (1992)). Because, the court continued, petitioner could not demonstrate such an invasion, its cause of action was moot. 169 F. 3d, at 1296-1297. In so holding, the Tenth Circuit “confused mootness with standing,” Friends of Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc., ante, at 189, and as a result placed the burden of proof on the wrong party. If this case is moot, it is because the Federal Government has accepted CDOT’s *222 certification of petitioner as a disadvantaged business enterprise, and has thereby eeased its offending conduct. Voluntary cessation of challenged conduct moots a ease, however, only if it is “absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur.” United States v. Concentrated Phosphate Export Assn., Inc., 393 U. S. 199, 203 (1968) (emphasis added). And the “ ‘heavy burden of persua[ding]’ the court that the challenged conduct cannot reasonably be expected to start up again lies with the party asserting mootness.” Friends of Earth, ante, at 189 (emphasis added) (quoting Concentrated Phosphate Export Assn., supra, at 203). Because respondents cannot satisfy this burden, the Tenth Circuit’s error was a crucial one. As common sense would suggest, and as the Tenth Circuit itself recognized, DOT accepts only “valid certification[s]” from state agencies. 169 F. 3d, at 1298. As respondents concede, however, see Brief in Opposition 13-14, n. 6, DOT has yet to approve — as it must—CDOT’s procedure for certifying disadvantaged business enterprises, see 64 Fed. Reg. 5129 (1999) (49 CFR § 26.21(b)(1)) (“[The State] must submit a [disadvantaged business enterprise] program conforming to this part by August 31, 1999 to the concerned operating administration”). DOT has promulgated regulations outlining the procedure state highway agencies must follow in certifying firms as disadvantaged business enterprises. See 64 Fed. Reg. 5096-5148 (pt. 26). As described earlier, those regulations require the agency to presume that “women, Black Americans, Hispanic Americans, Native Americans, Asian-Pacific Americans, Subcontinent Asian Americans, or other minorities found to be disadvantaged by the [Small Business Administration]” are socially disadvantaged. Id., at 5136 (§ 26.67(a)(1)). Before individuals not members of those groups may be certified, the state agency must make individual determinations as to disadvantage. See id., at 5136-5137 (§ 26.67(d)) (“In such a proceeding, the applicant firm *223 has the burden of demonstrating to [the state highway-agency], by a preponderance of the evidence, that the individuals who own and control it are socially and economically disadvantaged”); id., at 5147-5148 (pt. 26, subpt. D, App. E) (providing list of “elements” that highway agencies must consider in making individualized determinations of social disadvantage). CDOT’s new procedure under which petitioner was certified applies no presumption in favor of minority groups, and accepts without investigation a firm’s self-certification of entitlement to disadvantaged business status. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 109-111. Given the material differences (not to say incompatibility) between that procedure and the requirements of the DOT regulations, it is not at all clear that CDOT’s certification is a “valid certification,” and hence not at all clear that the Subcontractor Compensation Clause requires its acceptance. Before the Tenth Circuit, respondents took pains to “ex-presé] no opinion regarding the correctness of Colorado’s determination that [petitioner] is entitled to [disadvantaged business] status.” Motion by the Federal Appellants to Dismiss Appeal as Moot and to Vacate the District Court Judgment in No. 97-1304, p. 3, n. 2. Instead, they stated flatly that “in the event there is a third-party challenge to [petitioner’s] certification as a [disadvantaged business enterprise] and the decision on the challenge is appealed to DOT, DOT may review the decision to determine whether the certification was proper.” Id., at 3-4, n. 2. In addition, DOT itself has the power to require States to initiate proceedings to withdraw a firm’s disadvantaged status if there is “reasonable cause to believe” that the firm “does not meet the eligibility criteria” set forth in the federal regulations. 64 Fed. Reg. 5142 (§ 26.87(e)(1)). Given the patent incompatibility of the certification with the federal regulations, it is far from clear that these possibilities will not become reality. Indeed, challenges to petitioner’s disadvantaged business status seem quite probable now that the Tenth Circuit, by *224 vacating Adarand II, has eliminated the sole basis for petitioner’s certification in the first place. The Tenth Circuit dismissed these possibilities as insufficiently particular and concrete to grant standing and therefore “too conjectural and speculative to avoid a finding of mootness.” 169 F. 3d, at 1298 (internal quotation marks omitted). As we recently noted in Friends of the Earth, however, “[t]he plain lesson of [our precedents] is that there are circumstances in which the prospect that a defendant will engage in (or resume) harmful conduct may be too speculative to support standing, but not too speculative to overcome mootness.” Ante, at 190. Because, under the circumstances of this case, it is impossible to conclude that respondents have borne their burden of establishing that it is “absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur,” ante, at 189, petitioner’s cause of action remains alive. * * * It is no small matter to deprive a litigant of the rewards of its efforts, particularly in a case that has been litigated up to this Court and back down again. Such action on grounds of mootness would be justified only if it were absolutely clear that the litigant no longer had any need of the judicial protection that it sought. Because that is not the case here, the petition for writ of certiorari is granted, the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. It is so ordered. 1 Congress recently enacted the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, Pub. L. 105-178, Tit. I, § 1101(b), 112 Stat. 113, the successor appropriations measure to ISTEA. Although the new Act contains simi *218 lar provisions, it is technically the provisions of ISTEA that apply to funding obligated in prior fiscal years but not yet expended. 2 Before the Tenth Circuit, the parties disagreed as to whether the scope of the District Court’s remedial order was appropriate. In characterizing that order as we do here, we do not intend to take a position in that dispute.  \n",



                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Petitioner Fifth Third Bancorp maintains a defined-contribution retirement savings plan for its employees. Plan participants may direct their contributions into any of a number of investment options, including an \"employee stock ownership plan\" (ESOP), which invests its funds primarily in Fifth Third stock. Respondents, former Fifth Third employees and ESOP participants, filed this lawsuit against petitioners, Fifth Third and several of its officers who are alleged to be fiduciaries of the ESOP. The complaint alleges that petitioners breached the fiduciary duty of prudence imposed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), 29 U.S.C. § 1104 (a)(1)(B). Specifically, the complaint alleges that petitioners should have known-on the basis of both publicly available information and inside information available to petitioners because they were Fifth Third officers-that Fifth Third stock was overpriced and excessively risky. It further alleges that a prudent fiduciary in petitioners' position would have responded to this information by selling off the ESOP's holdings of Fifth Third stock, refraining from purchasing more Fifth Third stock, or disclosing the negative inside information so that the market could correct the stock's price downward. According to the complaint, petitioners did none of these things, and the price of Fifth Third stock ultimately fell, reducing respondents' retirement savings. The District Court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim, but the Sixth Circuit reversed. It concluded that ESOP fiduciaries are entitled to a \"presumption of prudence\" that does not apply to other ERISA fiduciaries but that the presumption is an evidentiary one and therefore does not apply at the pleading stage. The court went on to hold that the complaint stated a claim for breach of fiduciary duty. Held : 1. ESOP fiduciaries are not entitled to any special presumption of prudence. Rather, they are subject to the same duty of prudence that applies to ERISA fiduciaries in general, § 1104(a)(1)(B), except that they need not diversify the fund's assets, § 1104(a)(2). This conclusion follows from the relevant provisions of ERISA. Section 1104(a)(1)(B) \"imposes a 'prudent person' standard by which to measure fiduciaries' investment decisions and disposition of assets.\" Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Russell, 473 U.S. 134 , 143, n. 10, 105 S.Ct. 3085 , 87 L.Ed.2d 96 .Section 1104(a)(1)(C) requires ERISA fiduciaries to diversify plan assets. And § 1104(a)(2) establishes the extent to which those duties are loosened in the ESOP context by providing that \"the diversification requirement of [§ 1104(a)(1)(C) ] and the prudence requirement (only to the extent that it requires diversification) of [§ 1104(a)(1)(B) ] [are] not violated by acquisition or holding of [employer stock].\" Section 1104(a)(2) makes no reference to a special \"presumption\" in favor of ESOP fiduciaries and does not require plaintiffs to allege that the employer was, e.g., on the \"brink of collapse.\" It simply modifies the duties imposed by § 1104(a)(1) in a precisely delineated way. Thus, aside from the fact that ESOP fiduciaries are not liable for losses that result from a failure to diversify, they are subject to the duty of prudence like other ERISA fiduciaries. Pp. 2465 - 2471. 2. On remand, the Sixth Circuit should reconsider whether the complaint states a claim by applying the pleading standard as discussed in Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662 , 677-680, 129 S.Ct. 1937 , 173 L.Ed.2d 868 , and Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544 , 554-563, 127 S.Ct. 1955 , 167 L.Ed.2d 929 , in light of the following considerations. Pp. 2471 - 2473. (a) Where a stock is publicly traded, allegations that a fiduciary should have recognized on the basis of publicly available information that the market was overvaluing or undervaluing the stock are generally implausible and thus insufficient to state a claim under Twombly and Iqbal . Pp. 2471 - 2472. (b) To state a claim for breach of the duty of prudence, a complaint must plausibly allege an alternative action that the defendant could have taken, that would have been legal, and that a prudent fiduciary in the same circumstances would not have viewed as more likely to harm the fund than to help it. Where the complaint alleges that a fiduciary was imprudent in failing to act on the basis of inside information, the analysis is informed by the following points. First, ERISA's duty of prudence never requires a fiduciary to break the law, and so a fiduciary cannot be imprudent for failing to buy or sell stock in violation of the insider trading laws. Second, where a complaint faults fiduciaries for failing to decide, based on negative inside information, to refrain from making additional stock purchases or for failing to publicly disclose that information so that the stock would no longer be overvalued, courts should consider the extent to which imposing an ERISA-based obligation either to refrain from making a planned trade or to disclose inside information to the public could conflict with the complex insider trading and corporate disclosure requirements set forth by the federal securities laws or with the objectives of those laws. Third, courts confronted with such claims should consider whether the complaint has plausibly alleged that a prudent fiduciary in the defendant's position could not have concluded that stopping purchases or publicly disclosing negative information would do more harm than good to the fund by causing a drop in the stock price and a concomitant drop in the value of the stock already held by the fund.

Egleston, Gainey McKenna & Egleston, New York, NY, Ronald J. Mann, Counsel of Record, New York, NY, Maurice R. Mitts, Mitts Law, LLC, Philadelphia, PA, for Respondents. Justice delivered the opinion of the Court. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), 88 Stat. 829 , as amended, 29 U.S.C. § 1001 et seq ., requires the fiduciary of a pension plan to act prudently in managing the plan's assets. § 1104(a)(1)(B). This case focuses upon that duty of prudence as applied to the fiduciary of an \"employee stock ownership plan\" (ESOP), a type of pension plan that invests primarily in the stock of the company that employs the plan participants. We consider whether, when an ESOP fiduciary's decision to buy or hold the employer's stock is challenged in court, the fiduciary is entitled to a defense-friendly standard that the lower courts have called a \"presumption of prudence.\" The Courts of Appeals that have considered the question have held that such a presumption does apply, with the presumption generally defined as a requirement that the plaintiff make a showing that would not be required in an ordinary duty-of-prudence case, such as that the employer was on the brink of collapse. We hold that no such presumption applies. Instead, ESOP fiduciaries are subject to the same duty of prudence that applies to ERISA fiduciaries in general, except that they need not diversify the fund's assets. § 1104(a)(2). I Petitioner Fifth Third Bancorp, a large financial services firm, maintains for its employees a defined-contribution retirement savings plan. Employees may choose to contribute a portion of their compensation to the Plan as retirement savings, and Fifth Third provides matching contributions of up to 4% of an employee's compensation. The Plan's assets are invested in 20 separate funds, including mutual funds and an ESOP. Plan participants can allocate their contributions among the funds however they like; Fifth Third's matching contributions, on the other hand, are always invested initially in the ESOP, though the participant can then choose to move them to another fund. The Plan requires the ESOP's funds to be \"invested primarily in shares of common stock of Fifth Third.\" App. 350. Respondents, who are former Fifth Third employees and ESOP participants, filed this putative class action in Federal District Court in Ohio. They claim that petitioners, Fifth Third and various Fifth Third officers, were fiduciaries of the Plan and violated the duties of loyalty and prudence imposed by ERISA. See §§ 1109(a), 1132(a)(2). We limit our review to the duty-of-prudence claims. The complaint alleges that by July 2007, the fiduciaries knew or should have known that Fifth Third's stock was overvalued and excessively risky for two separate reasons. First, publicly available information such as newspaper articles provided early warning signs that subprime lending, which formed a large part of Fifth Third's business, would soon leave creditors high and dry as the housing market collapsed and subprime borrowers became unable to pay off their mortgages. Second, nonpublic information (which petitioners knew because they were Fifth Third insiders) indicated that Fifth Third officers had deceived the market by making material misstatements about the company's financial prospects. Those misstatements led the market to overvalue Fifth Third stock-the ESOP's primary investment-and so petitioners, using the participants' money, were consequently paying more for that stock than it was worth. The complaint further alleges that a prudent fiduciary in petitioners' position would have responded to this information in one or more of the following ways: (1) by selling the ESOP's holdings of Fifth Third stock before the value of those holdings declined, (2) by refraining from purchasing any more Fifth Third stock, (3) by canceling the Plan's ESOP option, and (4) by disclosing the inside information so that the market would adjust its valuation of Fifth Third stock downward and the ESOP would no longer be overpaying for it. Rather than follow any of these courses of action, petitioners continued to hold and buy Fifth Third stock. Then the market crashed, and Fifth Third's stock price fell by 74% between July 2007 and September 2009, when the complaint was filed. Since the ESOP's funds were invested primarily in Fifth Third stock, this fall in price eliminated a large part of the retirement savings that the participants had invested in the ESOP. (The stock has since made a partial recovery to around half of its July 2007 price.) The District Court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim. 757 F.Supp.2d 753 (S.D.Ohio 2010). The court began from the premise that where a lawsuit challenges ESOP fiduciaries' investment decisions, \"the plan fiduciaries start with a presumption that their 'decision to remain invested in employer securities was reasonable.' \" Id., at 758 (quoting Kuper v. Iovenko, 66 F.3d 1447 , 1459 (C.A.6 1995)). The court next held that this rule is applicable at the pleading stage and then concluded that the complaint's allegations were insufficient to overcome it. 757 F.Supp.2d, at 758-759, 760-762 . The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed. 692 F.3d 410 (2012). Although it agreed that ESOP fiduciaries are entitled to a presumption of prudence, it took the view that the presumption is evidentiary only and therefore does not apply at the pleading stage. Id., at 418-419 . Thus, the Sixth Circuit simply asked whether the allegations in the complaint were sufficient to state a claim for breach of fiduciary duty. Id., at 419 . It held that they were. Id., at 419-420 . In light of differences among the Courts of Appeals as to the nature of the presumption of prudence applicable to ESOP fiduciaries, we granted the fiduciaries' petition for certiorari. Compare In re Citigroup ERISA Litigation, 662 F.3d 128 , 139-140 (C.A.2 2011) (presumption of prudence applies at the pleading stage and requires the plaintiff to establish that the employer was \"in a 'dire situation' that was objectively unforeseeable by the settlor\" (quoting Edgar v. Avaya, Inc., 503 F.3d 340 , 348 (C.A.3 2007))), with Pfeil v. State Street Bank & Trust Co., 671 F.3d 585 , 592-596 (C.A.6 2012) (presumption of prudence applies only at summary judgment and beyond and only requires the plaintiff to establish that \" 'a prudent fiduciary acting under similar circumstances would have made a different investment decision' \" (quoting Kuper, supra, at 1459 )). II A In applying a \"presumption of prudence\" that favors ESOP fiduciaries' purchasing or holding of employer stock, the lower courts have sought to reconcile congressional directives that are in some tension with each other. On the one hand, ERISA itself subjects pension plan fiduciaries to a duty of prudence. In a section titled \"Fiduciary duties,\" it says: \"(a) Prudent man standard of care \"(1) Subject to sections 1103(c) and (d), 1342, and 1344 of this title, a fiduciary shall discharge his duties with respect to a plan solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries and- \"(A) for the exclusive purpose of: \"(i) providing benefits to participants and their beneficiaries; and \"(ii) defraying reasonable expenses of administering the plan; \"(B) with the care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing that a prudent man acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character and with like aims; \"(C) by diversifying the investments of the plan so as to minimize the risk of large losses, unless under the circumstances it is clearly prudent not to do so; and \"(D) in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the plan insofar as such documents and instruments are consistent with the provisions of this subchapter and subchapter III of this chapter.\" § 1104. See also Central States, Southeast & Southwest Areas Pension Fund v. Central Transport, Inc., 472 U.S. 559 , 570, 105 S.Ct. 2833 , 86 L.Ed.2d 447 (1985) (Section 1104(a)(1) imposes \"strict standards of trustee conduct ... derived from the common law of trusts-most prominently, a standard of loyalty and a standard of care\"). On the other hand, Congress recognizes that ESOPs are \"designed to invest primarily in\" the stock of the participants' employer, § 1107(d)(6)(A), meaning that they are not prudently diversified. And it has written into law its \"interest in encouraging\" their use. One statutory provision says: \"Intent of Congress Concerning Employee Stock Ownership Plans.-The Congress, in a series of laws [including ERISA] has made clear its interest in encouraging [ESOPs] as a bold and innovative method of strengthening the free private enterprise system which will solve the dual problems of securing capital funds for necessary capital growth and of bringing about stock ownership by all corporate employees. The Congress is deeply concerned that the objectives sought by this series of laws will be made unattainable by regulations and rulings which treat [ESOPs] as conventional retirement plans, which reduce the freedom of the employee trusts and employers to take the necessary steps to implement the plans, and which otherwise block the establishment and success of these plans.\" Tax Reform Act of 1976, § 803(h), 90 Stat. 1590 . In addition, and in keeping with this statement of intent, Congress has given ESOP fiduciaries a statutory exemption from some of the duties imposed on ERISA fiduciaries. ERISA specifically provides that, in the case of ESOPs and other eligible individual account plans, \"the diversification requirement of [§ 1104(a)(1)(C) ] and the prudence requirement (only to the extent that it requires diversification) of [§ 1104(a)(1)(B) ] [are] not violated by acquisition or holding of [employer stock].\" § 1104(a)(2). Thus, an ESOP fiduciary is not obliged under § 1104(a)(1)(C) to \"diversif[y] the investments of the plan so as to minimize the risk of large losses\" or under § 1104(a)(1)(B) to act \"with the care, skill, prudence, and diligence\" of a \"prudent man\" insofar as that duty \"requires diversification.\" B Several Courts of Appeals have gone beyond ERISA's express provision that ESOP fiduciaries need not diversify by giving ESOP fiduciaries a \"presumption of prudence\" when their decisions to hold or buy employer stock are challenged as imprudent. Thus, the Third Circuit has held that \"an ESOP fiduciary who invests the [ESOP's] assets in employer stock is entitled to a presumption that it acted consistently with ERISA\" in doing so. Moench v. Robertson, 62 F.3d 553 , 571 (1995). The Ninth Circuit has said that to \"overcome the presumption of prudent investment, plaintiffs must ... make allegations that clearly implicate the company's viability as an ongoing concern or show a precipitous decline in the employer's stock ... combined with evidence that the company is on the brink of collapse or is undergoing serious mismanagement.\" Quan v. Computer Sciences Corp., 623 F.3d 870 , 882 (2010) (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted). And the Seventh Circuit has described the presumption as requiring plaintiffs to \"allege and ultimately prove that the company faced 'impending collapse' or 'dire circumstances' that could not have been foreseen by the founder of the plan.\" White v. Marshall & Ilsley Corp., 714 F.3d 980 , 989 (2013). The Sixth Circuit agreed that some sort of presumption favoring an ESOP fiduciary's purchase of employer stock is appropriate. But it held that this presumption is an evidentiary rule that does not apply at the pleading stage. It further held that, to overcome the presumption, a plaintiff need not show that the employer was on the \"brink of collapse\" or the like. Rather, the plaintiff need only show that \" 'a prudent fiduciary acting under similar circumstances would have made a different investment decision.' \" 692 F.3d, at 418 (quoting Kuper, 66 F.3d, at 1459 ). Petitioners argue that the lower courts are right to apply a presumption of prudence, that it should apply from the pleading stage onward, and that the presumption should be strongly in favor of ESOP fiduciaries' purchasing and holding of employer stock. In particular, petitioners propose a rule that a challenge to an ESOP fiduciary's decision to hold or buy company stock \"cannot prevail unless extraordinary circumstances, such as a serious threat to the employer's viability, mean that continued investment would substantially impair the purpose of the plan.\" Brief for Petitioners 16. In petitioners' view, the \"purpose of the plan,\" in the case of an ESOP, is promoting employee ownership of the employer's stock over the long term. And, petitioners assert, that purpose is \"substantially impair[ed]\"-rendering continued investment imprudent-only when \"a serious threat to the employer's viability\" makes it likely that the employer will go out of business. This is because the goal of employee ownership will be substantially impaired only if the employer goes out of business, leaving the employees with no company to own. Id., at 24. We must decide whether ERISA contains some such presumption. III A In our view, the law does not create a special presumption favoring ESOP fiduciaries. Rather, the same standard of prudence applies to all ERISA fiduciaries, including ESOP fiduciaries, except that an ESOP fiduciary is under no duty to diversify the ESOP's holdings. This conclusion follows from the pertinent provisions of ERISA, which are set forth above. Section 1104(a)(1)(B) \"imposes a 'prudent person' standard by which to measure fiduciaries' investment decisions and disposition of assets.\" Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Russell, 473 U.S. 134 , 143, n. 10, 105 S.Ct. 3085 , 87 L.Ed.2d 96 (1985). Section 1104(a)(1)(C) requires ERISA fiduciaries to diversify plan assets. And § 1104(a)(2) establishes the extent to which those duties are loosened in the ESOP context to ensure that employers are permitted and encouraged to offer ESOPs. Section 1104(a)(2) makes no reference to a special \"presumption\" in favor of ESOP fiduciaries. It does not require plaintiffs to allege that the employer was on the \"brink of collapse,\" under \"extraordinary circumstances,\" or the like. Instead, § 1104(a)(2) simply modifies the duties imposed by § 1104(a)(1) in a precisely delineated way: It provides that an ESOP fiduciary is exempt from § 1104(a)(1)(C)'s diversification requirement and also from § 1104(a)(1)(B)'s duty of prudence, but \" only to the extent that it requires diversification .\" § 1104(a)(2) (emphasis added). Thus, ESOP fiduciaries, unlike ERISA fiduciaries generally, are not liable for losses that result from a failure to diversify. But aside from that distinction, because ESOP fiduciaries are ERISA fiduciaries and because § 1104(a)(1)(B)'s duty of prudence applies to all ERISA fiduciaries, ESOP fiduciaries are subject to the duty of prudence just as other ERISA fiduciaries are. B Petitioners make several arguments to the contrary. First, petitioners argue that the special purpose of an ESOP-investing participants' savings in the stock of their employer-calls for a presumption that such investments are prudent. Their argument is as follows: ERISA defines the duty of prudence in terms of what a prudent person would do \"in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character and with like aims.\" § 1104(a)(1)(B). The \"character\" and \"aims\" of an ESOP differ from those of an ordinary retirement investment, such as a diversified mutual fund. An ordinary plan seeks (1) to maximize retirement savings for participants while (2) avoiding excessive risk. But an ESOP also seeks (3) to promote employee ownership of employer stock. For instance, Fifth Third's Plan requires the ESOP's assets to be \"invested primarily in shares of common stock of Fifth Third.\" App. 350. In light of this additional goal, an ESOP fiduciary's decision to buy more shares of employer stock, even if it would be imprudent were it viewed solely as an attempt to secure financial retirement benefits while avoiding excessive risk, might nonetheless be prudent if understood as an attempt to promote employee ownership of employer stock, a goal that Congress views as important. See Tax Reform Act of 1976, § 803(h), 90 Stat. 1590 . Thus, a claim that an ESOP fiduciary's investment in employer stock was imprudent as a way of securing retirement savings should be viewed unfavorably because, unless the company was about to go out of business, that investment was advancing the additional goal of employee ownership of employer stock. We cannot accept the claim that underlies this argument, namely, that the content of ERISA's duty of prudence varies depending upon the specific nonpecuniary goal set out in an ERISA plan, such as what petitioners claim is the nonpecuniary goal here. Taken in context, § 1104(a)(1)(B)'s reference to \"an enterprise of a like character and with like aims\" means an enterprise with what the immediately preceding provision calls the \"exclusive purpose\" to be pursued by all ERISA fiduciaries: \"providing benefits to participants and their beneficiaries\" while \"defraying reasonable expenses of administering the plan.\" §§ 1104(a)(1)(A)(i), (ii). Read in the context of ERISA as a whole, the term \"benefits\" in the provision just quoted must be understood to refer to the sort of financial benefits (such as retirement income) that trustees who manage investments typically seek to secure for the trust's beneficiaries. Cf. § 1002(2)(A) (defining \"employee pension benefit plan\" and \"pension plan\" to mean plans that provide employees with \"retirement income\" or other \"deferral of income\"). The term does not cover nonpecuniary benefits like those supposed to arise from employee ownership of employer stock. Consider the statute's requirement that fiduciaries act \"in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the plan insofar as such documents and instruments are consistent with the provisions of this subchapter .\" § 1104(a)(1)(D) (emphasis added). This provision makes clear that the duty of prudence trumps the instructions of a plan document, such as an instruction to invest exclusively in employer stock even if financial goals demand the contrary. See also § 1110(a) (With irrelevant exceptions, \"any provision in an agreement or instrument which purports to relieve a fiduciary from responsibility ... for any ... duty under this part shall be void as against public policy\"). This rule would make little sense if, as petitioners argue, the duty of prudence is defined by the aims of the particular plan as set out in the plan documents, since in that case the duty of prudence could never conflict with a plan document. Consider also § 1104(a)(2), which exempts an ESOP fiduciary from § 1104(a)(1)(B)'s duty of prudence but \"only to the extent that it requires diversification.\" What need would there be for this specific provision were the nature of § 1104(a)(1)(B)'s duty of prudence altered anyway in the case of an ESOP in light of the ESOP's aim of promoting employee ownership of employer stock? Cf. Arlington Central School Dist. Bd. of Ed. v. Murphy, 548 U.S. 291 , 299, n. 1, 126 S.Ct. 2455 , 165 L.Ed.2d 526 (2006) (\"[I]t is generally presumed that statutes do not contain surplusage\"). Petitioners are right to point out that Congress, in seeking to permit and promote ESOPs, was pursuing purposes other than the financial security of plan participants. See, e.g., Tax Reform Act of 1976, § 803(h), 90 Stat. 1590 (Congress intended ESOPs to help \"secur[e] capital funds for necessary capital growth and ... brin[g] about stock ownership by all corporate employees\"). Congress pursued those purposes by promoting ESOPs with tax incentives. See 26 U.S.C. §§ 402 (e)(4), 404(k), 1042. And it also pursued them by exempting ESOPs from ERISA's diversification requirement, which otherwise would have precluded their creation. 29 U.S.C. § 1104 (a)(2). But we are not convinced that Congress also sought to promote ESOPs by further relaxing the duty of prudence as applied to ESOPs with the sort of presumption proposed by petitioners. Second, and relatedly, petitioners contend that the duty of prudence should be read in light of the rule under the common law of trusts that \"the settlor can reduce or waive the prudent man standard of care by specific language in the trust instrument.\" G. Bogert & G. Bogert, Law of Trusts and Trustees § 541, p. 172 (rev. 2d ed. 1993); see also Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 174, Comment d (1957) (\"By the terms of the trust the requirement of care and skill may be relaxed or modified\"). The argument is that, by commanding the ESOP fiduciary to invest primarily in Fifth Third stock, the plan documents waived the duty of prudence to the extent that it comes into conflict with investment in Fifth Third stock-at least unless \"extraordinary circumstances\" arise that so threaten the goal of employee ownership of Fifth Third stock that the fiduciaries must assume that the settlor would want them to depart from that goal under the common-law \"deviation doctrine.\" See id., § 167. This argument fails, however, in light of this Court's holding that, by contrast to the rule at common law, \"trust documents cannot excuse trustees from their duties under ERISA.\" Central States, Southeast & Southwest Areas Pension Fund, 472 U.S., at 568 , 105 S.Ct. 2833 ; see also 29 U.S.C. §§ 1104 (a)(1)(D), 1110(a). Third, petitioners argue that subjecting ESOP fiduciaries to a duty of prudence without the protection of a special presumption will lead to conflicts with the legal prohibition on insider trading. The potential for conflict arises because ESOP fiduciaries often are company insiders and because suits against insider fiduciaries frequently allege, as the complaint in this case alleges, that the fiduciaries were imprudent in failing to act on inside information they had about the value of the employer's stock. This concern is a legitimate one. But an ESOP-specific rule that a fiduciary does not act imprudently in buying or holding company stock unless the company is on the brink of collapse (or the like) is an ill-fitting means of addressing it. While ESOP fiduciaries may be more likely to have insider information about a company that the fund is investing in than are other ERISA fiduciaries, the potential for conflict with the securities laws would be the same for a non-ESOP fiduciary who had relevant inside information about a potential investment. And the potential for conflict is the same for an ESOP fiduciary whose company is on the brink of collapse as for a fiduciary who is invested in a healthier company. (Surely a fiduciary is not obligated to break the insider trading laws even if his company is about to fail.) The potential for conflict therefore does not persuade us to accept a presumption of the sort adopted by the lower courts and proposed by petitioners. We discuss alternative means of dealing with the potential for conflict in Part IV, infra . Finally, petitioners argue that, without some sort of special presumption, the threat of costly duty-of-prudence lawsuits will deter companies from offering ESOPs to their employees, contrary to the stated intent of Congress. Cf. Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co., 473 U.S., at 148, n. 17 , 105 S.Ct. 3085 (\"Congress was concerned lest the cost of federal standards discourage the growth of private pension plans\"). ESOP plans instruct their fiduciaries to invest in company stock, and § 1104(a)(1)(D) requires fiduciaries to follow plan documents so long as they do not conflict with ERISA. Thus, in many cases an ESOP fiduciary who fears that continuing to invest in company stock may be imprudent finds himself between a rock and a hard place: If he keeps investing and the stock goes down he may be sued for acting imprudently in violation of § 1104(a)(1)(B), but if he stops investing and the stock goes up he may be sued for disobeying the plan documents in violation of § 1104(a)(1)(D). See, e.g., White, 714 F.3d, at 987 (\"[F]iduciaries could be liable either for the company stock's poor performance if they continue to invest in employer stock, or for missing the opportunity to benefit from good performance if they do not.... Such a high exposure to litigation risks in either direction could discourage employers from offering ESOPs, which are favored by Congress\"); Evans v. Akers, 534 F.3d 65 , 68 (C.A.1 2008) (describing two lawsuits challenging the decisions of a plan's fiduciaries with \"diametrically opposed theor[ies] of liability\": one arguing that the fiduciaries acted imprudently by continuing to invest in company stock, and the other contending that they acted imprudently by divesting \"despite the company's solid potential to emerge from bankruptcy with substantial value for shareholders\"). Petitioners argue that, given the threat of such expensive litigation, ESOPs cannot thrive unless their fiduciaries are granted a defense-friendly presumption. Petitioners are basically seeking relief from what they believe are meritless, economically burdensome lawsuits. We agree that Congress sought to encourage the creation of ESOPs. And we have recognized that \"ERISA represents a ' \"careful balancing\" between ensuring fair and prompt enforcement of rights under a plan and the encouragement of the creation of such plans.' \" Conkright v. Frommert, 559 U.S. 506 , 517, 130 S.Ct. 1640 , 176 L.Ed.2d 469 (2010) (quoting Aetna Health Inc. v. Davila, 542 U.S. 200 , 215, 124 S.Ct. 2488 , 159 L.Ed.2d 312 (2004)); see also Varity Corp. v. Howe, 516 U.S. 489 , 497, 116 S.Ct. 1065 , 134 L.Ed.2d 130 (1996) (In \"interpret[ing] ERISA's fiduciary duties,\" \"courts may have to take account of competing congressional purposes, such as Congress' desire to offer employees enhanced protection for their benefits, on the one hand, and, on the other, its desire not to create a system that is so complex that administrative costs, or litigation expenses, unduly discourage employers from offering welfare benefit plans in the first place\"). At the same time, we do not believe that the presumption at issue here is an appropriate way to weed out meritless lawsuits or to provide the requisite \"balancing.\" The proposed presumption makes it impossible for a plaintiff to state a duty-of-prudence claim, no matter how meritorious, unless the employer is in very bad economic circumstances. Such a rule does not readily divide the plausible sheep from the meritless goats. That important task can be better accomplished through careful, context-sensitive scrutiny of a complaint's allegations. We consequently stand by our conclusion that the law does not create a special presumption of prudence for ESOP fiduciaries. IV We consider more fully one important mechanism for weeding out meritless claims, the motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. That mechanism, which gave rise to the lower court decisions at issue here, requires careful judicial consideration of whether the complaint states a claim that the defendant has acted imprudently. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 12(b)(6); Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662 , 677-680, 129 S.Ct. 1937 , 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009); Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544 , 554-563, 127 S.Ct. 1955 , 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007). Because the content of the duty of prudence turns on \"the circumstances ... prevailing\" at the time the fiduciary acts, § 1104(a)(1)(B), the appropriate inquiry will necessarily be context specific. The District Court in this case granted petitioners' motion to dismiss the complaint because it held that respondents could not overcome the presumption of prudence. The Court of Appeals, by contrast, concluded that no presumption applied. And we agree with that conclusion. The Court of Appeals, however, went on to hold that respondents had stated a plausible duty-of-prudence claim. 692 F.3d, at 419-420 . The arguments made here, along with our review of the record, convince us that the judgment of the Court of Appeals should be vacated and the case remanded. On remand, the Court of Appeals should apply the pleading standard as discussed in Twombly and Iqbal in light of the following considerations. A Respondents allege that, as of July 2007, petitioners knew or should have known in light of publicly available information, such as newspaper articles, that continuing to hold and purchase Fifth Third stock was imprudent. App. 48-53. The complaint alleges, among other things, that petitioners \"continued to allow the Plan's investment in Fifth Third Stock even during the time that the stock price was declining in value as a result of [the] collapse of the housing market\" and that \"[a] prudent fiduciary facing similar circumstances would not have stood idly by as the Plan's assets were decimated.\" Id., at 53. In our view, where a stock is publicly traded, allegations that a fiduciary should have recognized from publicly available information alone that the market was over- or undervaluing the stock are implausible as a general rule, at least in the absence of special circumstances. Many investors take the view that \" 'they have little hope of outperforming the market in the long run based solely on their analysis of publicly available information,' \" and accordingly they \" 'rely on the security's market price as an unbiased assessment of the security's value in light of all public information.' \" Halliburton Co. v. Erica P. John Fund, Inc. --- U.S. ----, ----, 134 S.Ct. 2398 , 2411, 189 L.Ed.2d 339 , 2014 WL 2807181 (2014) (quoting Amgen Inc. v. Connecticut Retirement Plans and Trust Funds, 568 U.S. ----, ----, 133 S.Ct. 1184 , 1192, 185 L.Ed.2d 308 (2013)). ERISA fiduciaries, who likewise could reasonably see \"little hope of outperforming the market ... based solely on their analysis of publicly available information,\" ibid., may, as a general matter, likewise prudently rely on the market price. In other words, a fiduciary usually \"is not imprudent to assume that a major stock market ... provides the best estimate of the value of the stocks traded on it that is available to him.\" Summers v. State Street Bank & Trust Co., 453 F.3d 404 , 408 (C.A.7 2006); see also White, 714 F.3d, at 992 (A fiduciary's \"fail[ure] to outsmart a presumptively efficient market ... is ... not a sound basis for imposing liability\"); cf. Quan, 623 F.3d, at 881 (\"Fiduciaries are not expected to predict the future of the company stock's performance\"). We do not here consider whether a plaintiff could nonetheless plausibly allege imprudence on the basis of publicly available information by pointing to a special circumstance affecting the reliability of the market price as \" 'an unbiased assessment of the security's value in light of all public information,' \" Halliburton Co., supra, at ----, 134 S.Ct., at 2411 (quoting Amgen Inc., supra, at ----, 133 S.Ct., at 1192 ), that would make reliance on the market's valuation imprudent. In this case, the Court of Appeals held that the complaint stated a claim because respondents \"allege that Fifth Third engaged in lending practices that were equivalent to participation in the subprime lending market, that Defendants were aware of the risks of such investments by the start of the class period, and that such risks made Fifth Third stock an imprudent investment.\" 692 F.3d, at 419-420 . The Court of Appeals did not point to any special circumstance rendering reliance on the market price imprudent. The court's decision to deny dismissal therefore appears to have been based on an erroneous understanding of the prudence of relying on market prices. B Respondents also claim that petitioners behaved imprudently by failing to act on the basis of nonpublic information that was available to them because they were Fifth Third insiders. In particular, the complaint alleges that petitioners had inside information indicating that the market was overvaluing Fifth Third stock and that they could have used this information to prevent losses to the fund by (1) selling the ESOP's holdings of Fifth Third stock; (2) refraining from future stock purchases (including by removing the Plan's ESOP option altogether); or (3) publicly disclosing the inside information so that the market would correct the stock price downward, with the result that the ESOP could continue to buy Fifth Third stock without paying an inflated price for it. See App. 17, 88-89, 113. To state a claim for breach of the duty of prudence on the basis of inside information, a plaintiff must plausibly allege an alternative action that the defendant could have taken that would have been consistent with the securities laws and that a prudent fiduciary in the same circumstances would not have viewed as more likely to harm the fund than to help it. The following three points inform the requisite analysis. First, in deciding whether the complaint states a claim upon which relief can be granted, courts must bear in mind that the duty of prudence, under ERISA as under the common law of trusts, does not require a fiduciary to break the law. Cf. Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 166, Comment a (\"The trustee is not under a duty to the beneficiary to do an act which is criminal or tortious\"). Federal securities laws \"are violated when a corporate insider trades in the securities of his corporation on the basis of material, nonpublic information.\" United States v. O'Hagan, 521 U.S. 642 , 651-652, 117 S.Ct. 2199 , 138 L.Ed.2d 724 (1997). As every Court of Appeals to address the question has held, ERISA's duty of prudence cannot require an ESOP fiduciary to perform an action-such as divesting the fund's holdings of the employer's stock on the basis of inside information-that would violate the securities laws. See, e.g., Rinehart v. Akers, 722 F.3d 137 , 146-147 (C.A.2 2013); Kirschbaum v. Reliant Energy, Inc., 526 F.3d 243 , 256 (C.A.5 2008); White, supra, at 992 ; Quan, supra, at 881-882 , and n. 8; Lanfear v. Home Depot, Inc., 679 F.3d 1267 , 1282 (C.A.11 2012). To the extent that the Sixth Circuit denied dismissal based on the theory that the duty of prudence required petitioners to sell the ESOP's holdings of Fifth Third stock, its denial of dismissal was erroneous. Second, where a complaint faults fiduciaries for failing to decide, on the basis of the inside information, to refrain from making additional stock purchases or for failing to disclose that information to the public so that the stock would no longer be overvalued, additional considerations arise. The courts should consider the extent to which an ERISA-based obligation either to refrain on the basis of inside information from making a planned trade or to disclose inside information to the public could conflict with the complex insider trading and corporate disclosure requirements imposed by the federal securities laws or with the objectives of those laws. Cf. 29 U.S.C. § 1144 (d) (\"Nothing in this subchapter [which includes § 1104] shall be construed to alter, amend, modify, invalidate, impair, or supersede any law of the United States ... or any rule or regulation issued under any such law\"); Black & Decker Disability Plan v. Nord, 538 U.S. 822 , 831, 123 S.Ct. 1965 , 155 L.Ed.2d 1034 (2003) (\"Although Congress 'expect[ed]' courts would develop 'a federal common law of rights and obligations under ERISA-regulated plans,' the scope of permissible judicial innovation is narrower in areas where other federal actors are engaged\" (quoting Pilot Life Ins. Co. v. Dedeaux, 481 U.S. 41 , 56, 107 S.Ct. 1549 , 95 L.Ed.2d 39 (1987); citation omitted)); Varity Corp., 516 U.S., at 506 , 116 S.Ct. 1065 (reserving the question \"whether ERISA fiduciaries have any fiduciary duty to disclose truthful information on their own initiative, or in response to employee inquiries\"). The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has not advised us of its views on these matters, and we believe those views may well be relevant. Third, lower courts faced with such claims should also consider whether the complaint has plausibly alleged that a prudent fiduciary in the defendant's position could not have concluded that stopping purchases-which the market might take as a sign that insider fiduciaries viewed the employer's stock as a bad investment-or publicly disclosing negative information would do more harm than good to the fund by causing a drop in the stock price and a concomitant drop in the value of the stock already held by the fund. * * * We leave it to the courts below to apply the foregoing to the complaint in this case in the first instance. The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit is vacated and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. It is so ordered.

       "21106  509 U.S. 86 (1993) HARPER et al. v. VIRGINIA DEPARTMENT OF TAXATION No. 91-794. United States Supreme Court. Argued December 2, 1992. Decided June 18, 1993. CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF VIRGINIA *87 *88 Thomas, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Blackmun, Stevens, Scalia, and Souter, JJ., joined, and in Parts I and III of which White and Kennedy, JJ., joined. Scalia, J., filed a concurring opinion, post, p. 102. Kennedy, J., filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment, in which White, J., joined, post, p. 110. O'Connor, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Rehnquist, C. J., joined, post, p. 113. Michael J. Kator argued the cause and filed the briefs for petitioners. Gail Starling Marshall argued the cause for respondent. With her on the brief were Mary Sue Terry, Attorney General of Virginia, Stephen D. Rosenthal, Chief Deputy Attorney General, Gregory E. Lucyk and N. Pendleton Rogers, Senior Assistant Attorneys General, Barbara H. Vann, Assistant Attorney General, and Peter W. Low.[*] *89 Justice delivered the opinion of the Court. In Davis v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury, 489 U. S. 803 (1989), we held that a State violates the constitutional doctrine of intergovernmental tax immunity when it taxes retirement benefits paid by the Federal Government but exempts from taxation all retirement benefits paid by the State or its political subdivisions. Relying on the retroactivity analysis of Chevron Oil Co. v. Huson, 404 U. S. 97 (1971), the Supreme Court of Virginia twice refused to apply Davis to *90 taxes imposed before Davis was decided. In accord with Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U. S. 314 (1987), and James B. Beam Distilling Co. v. Georgia, 501 U. S. 529 (1991), we hold that this Court's application of a rule of federal law to the parties before the Court requires every court to give retroactive effect to that decision. We therefore reverse. I The Michigan tax scheme at issue in Davis \"exempt[ed] from taxation all retirement benefits paid by the State or its political subdivisions, but levie[d] an income tax on retirement benefits paid by . . . the Federal Government.\" 489 U. S., at 805. We held that the United States had not consented under 4 U. S. C. § 111[1] to this discriminatory imposition of a heavier tax burden on federal benefits than on state and local benefits. 489 U. S., at 808-817. Because Michigan \"conceded that a refund [was] appropriate,\" we recognized that federal retirees were entitled to a refund of taxes \"paid. . . pursuant to this invalid tax scheme.\" Id., at 817.[2] Like Michigan, Virginia exempted state and local employees' retirement benefits from state income taxation while taxing federal retirement benefits. Va. Code Ann. § 58.1 322(c)(3) (Supp. 1988). In response to Davis, Virginia repealed its exemption for state and local government employees. 1989 Va. Acts, Special Sess. II, ch. 3. It also enacted a special statute of limitations for refund claims made in light of Davis. Under this statute, taxpayers may seek a refund *91 of state taxes imposed on federal retirement benefits in 1985, 1986, 1987, and 1988 for up to one year from the date of the final judicial resolution of whether Virginia must refund these taxes. Va. Code Ann. § 58.1-1823(b) (Supp. 1992).[3] Petitioners, 421 federal civil service and military retirees, sought a refund of taxes \"erroneously or improperly assessed\" in violation of Davis ` nondiscrimination principle. Va. Code Ann. § 58.1-1826 (1991). The trial court denied relief. Law No. CL891080 (Va. Cir. Ct., Mar. 12, 1990). Applying the factors set forth in Chevron Oil Co. v. Huson, supra, at 106-107,[4] the court reasoned that \"Davis decided an issue of first impression whose resolution was not clearly foreshadowed,\" that \"prospective application of Davis will not retard its operation,\" and that \"retroactive application would result in inequity, injustice and hardship.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 20a. The Supreme Court of Virginia affirmed. Harper v. Virginia Dept. of Taxation, 241 Va. 232, 401 S. E. 2d 868 (1991). It too concluded, after consulting Chevron and the plurality opinion in American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith, 496 U. S. 167 (1990), that \"the Davis decision is not to be applied retroactively.\" 241 Va., at 240, 401 S. E. 2d, at 873. The court also rejected petitioners' contention that \"refunds *92 [were] due as a matter of state law.\" Ibid. It concluded that \"because the Davis decision is not to be applied retroactively, the pre-Davis assessments were neither erroneous nor improper\" under Virginia's tax refund statute. Id., at 241, 401 S. E. 2d, at 873. As a matter of Virginia law, the court held, a \"ruling declaring a taxing scheme unconstitutional is to be applied prospectively only.\" Ibid. This rationale supplied \"another reason\" for refusing relief. Ibid. Even as the Virginia courts were denying relief to petitioners, we were confronting a similar retroactivity problem in James B. Beam Distilling Co. v. Georgia, 501 U. S. 529 (1991). At issue was Bacchus Imports, Ltd. v. Dias, 468 U. S. 263 (1984), which prohibited States from imposing higher excise taxes on imported alcoholic beverages than on local products. The Supreme Court of Georgia had used the analysis described in Chevron Oil Co. v. Huson to deny retroactive effect to a decision of this Court. Six Members of this Court disagreed, concluding instead that Bacchus must be applied retroactively to claims arising from facts predating that decision. Beam, 501 U. S., at 532 (opinion of Souter, J.); id., at 544-545 (White, J., concurring in judgment); id., at 547-548 (Blackmun, J., concurring in judgment); id., at 548-549 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment). After deciding Beam, we vacated the judgment in Harper and remanded for further consideration. 501 U. S. 1247 (1991). On remand, the Supreme Court of Virginia again denied tax relief. 242 Va. 322, 410 S. E. 2d 629 (1991). It reasoned that because Michigan did not contest the Davis plaintiffs' entitlement to a refund, this Court \"made no . . . ruling\" regarding the retroactive application of its rule \"to the litigants in that case.\" 242 Va., at 326, 410 S. E. 2d, at 631. Concluding that Beam did not foreclose application of Chevron `s retroactivity analysis because \"the retroactivity issue was not decided in Davis, \" 242 Va., at 326, 410 S. E. 2d, at *93 631, the court \"reaffirm[ed] [its] prior decision in all respects,\" id., at 327, 410 S. E. 2d, at 632. When we decided Davis, 23 States gave preferential tax treatment to benefits received by employees of state and local governments relative to the tax treatment of benefits received by federal employees.[5] Like the Supreme Court of Virginia, several other state courts have refused to accord full retroactive effect to Davis as a controlling statement of federal law.[6] Two of the courts refusing to apply Davis retroactively have done so after this Court remanded for reconsideration in light of Beam. See Bass v. South Carolina, 501 U. S. 1246 (1991); Harper v. Virginia Dept. of Taxation, 501 U. S. 1247 (1991); Lewy v. Virginia Dept. of Taxation, decided with Harper v. Virginia Dept. of Taxation, 501 U. S. 1247 (1991). By contrast, the Supreme Court of Arkansas has concluded as a matter of federal law that Davis applies retroactively. Pledger v. Bosnick, 306 Ark. 45, 54-56, 811 S. W. 2d 286, 292-293 (1991), cert. pending, No. 91-375. Cf. Reich v. Collins, 262 Ga. 625, 422 S. E. 2d 846 (1992) *94 (holding that Davis applies retroactively but reasoning that state law precluded a refund), cert. pending, Nos. 92-1276 and 92-1453.[7] After the Supreme Court of Virginia reaffirmed its original decision, we granted certiorari a second time. 504 U. S. 907 (1992). We now reverse. II \"[B]oth the common law and our own decisions\" have \"recognized a general rule of retrospective effect for the constitutional decisions of this Court.\" Robinson v. Neil, 409 U. S. 505, 507 (1973). Nothing in the Constitution alters the fundamental rule of \"retrospective operation\" that has governed \"[j]udicial decisions . . . for near a thousand years.\" Kuhn v. Fairmont Coal Co., 215 U. S. 349, 372 (1910) (Holmes, J., dissenting). In Linkletter v. Walker, 381 U. S. 618 (1965), however, we developed a doctrine under which we could deny retroactive effect to a newly announced rule of criminal law. Under Linkletter, a decision to confine a new rule to prospective application rested on the purpose of the new rule, the reliance placed upon the previous view of the law, and \"the effect on the administration of justice of a retrospective application\" of the new rule. Id., at 636 (limiting Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S. 643 (1961)).[8] In the civil context, we similarly permitted the denial of retroactive effect to \"a new principle of law\" if such a limitation would avoid \"`injustice or hardship'\" without unduly undermining the \"purpose *95 and effect\" of the new rule. Chevron Oil Co. v. Huson, 404 U. S., at 106-107 (quoting Cipriano v. City of Houma, 395 U. S. 701, 706 (1969)).[9] We subsequently overruled Linkletter in Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U. S. 314 (1987), and eliminated limits on retroactivity in the criminal context by holding that all \"newly declared . . . rule[s]\" must be applied retroactively to all \"criminal cases pending on direct review.\" Id., at 322. This holding rested on two \"basic norms of constitutional adjudication.\" Ibid. First, we reasoned that \"the nature of judicial review\" strips us of the quintessentially \"legislat[ive]\" prerogative to make rules of law retroactive or prospective as we see fit. Ibid. Second, we concluded that \"selective application of new rules violates the principle of treating similarly situated [parties] the same.\" Id., at 323. Dicta in Griffith, however, stated that \"civil retroactivity. . . . continue[d] to be governed by the standard announced in Chevron Oil. \" Id., at 322, n. 8. We divided over the meaning of this dicta in American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith, 496 U. S. 167 (1990). The four Justices in the plurality used \"the Chevron Oil test\" to consider whether to confine \"the application of [American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Scheiner, 483 U. S. 266 (1987),] to taxation of highway use prior to June 23, 1987, the date we decided Scheiner. \" Id., *96 at 179 (opinion of O'Connor, J., joined by Rehnquist, C. J., and White and Kennedy, JJ.). Four other Justices rejected the plurality's \"anomalous approach\" to retroactivity and declined to hold that \"the law applicable to a particular case is that law which the parties believe in good faith to be applicable to the case.\" Id., at 219 (Stevens, J., dissenting, joined by Brennan, Marshall, and Blackmun, JJ.). Finally, despite concurring in the judgment, Justice Scalia \"share[d]\" the dissent's \"perception that prospective decisionmaking is incompatible with the judicial role.\" Id., at 201. Griffith and American Trucking thus left unresolved the precise extent to which the presumptively retroactive effect of this Court's decisions may be altered in civil cases. But we have since adopted a rule requiring the retroactive application of a civil decision such as Davis. Although James B. Beam Distilling Co. v. Georgia, 501 U. S. 529 (1991), did not produce a unified opinion for the Court, a majority of Justices agreed that a rule of federal law, once announced and applied to the parties to the controversy, must be given full retroactive effect by all courts adjudicating federal law. In announcing the judgment of the Court, Justice Souter laid down a rule for determining the retroactive effect of a civil decision: After the case announcing any rule of federal law has \"appl[ied] that rule with respect to the litigants\" before the court, no court may \"refuse to apply [that] rule . . . retroactively.\" Id., at 540 (opinion of Souter, J., joined by Stevens, J.). Justice Souter's view of retroactivity superseded \"any claim based on a Chevron Oil analysis.\" Ibid. Justice White likewise concluded that a decision \"extending the benefit of the judgment\" to the winning party \"is to be applied to other litigants whose cases were not final at the time of the [first] decision.\" Id., at 544 (opinion concurring in judgment). Three other Justices agreed that \"our judicial responsibility . . . requir[es] retroactive application of each . . . rule we announce.\" Id., at 548 (Blackmun, J., *97 joined by Marshall and Scalia, JJ., concurring in judgment). See also id., at 548-549 (Scalia, J., joined by Marshall and Blackmun, JJ., concurring in judgment). Beam controls this case, and we accordingly adopt a rule that fairly reflects the position of a majority of Justices in Beam: When this Court applies a rule of federal law to the parties before it, that rule is the controlling interpretation of federal law and must be given full retroactive effect in all cases still open on direct review and as to all events, regardless of whether such events predate or postdate our announcement of the rule. This rule extends Griffith `s ban against \"selective application of new rules.\" 479 U. S., at 323. Mindful of the \"basic norms of constitutional adjudication\" that animated our view of retroactivity in the criminal context, id., at 322, we now prohibit the erection of selective temporal barriers to the application of federal law in noncriminal cases. In both civil and criminal cases, we can scarcely permit \"the substantive law [to] shift and spring\" according to \"the particular equities of [individual parties'] claims\" of actual reliance on an old rule and of harm from a retroactive application of the new rule. Beam, supra, at 543 (opinion of Souter, J.). Our approach to retroactivity heeds the admonition that \"[t]he Court has no more constitutional authority in civil cases than in criminal cases to disregard current law or to treat similarly situated litigants differently.\" American Trucking, supra, at 214 (Stevens, J., dissenting). The Supreme Court of Virginia \"appl[ied] the threepronged Chevron Oil test in deciding the retroactivity issue\" presented by this litigation. 242 Va., at 326, 410 S. E. 2d, at 631. When this Court does not \"reserve the question whether its holding should be applied to the parties before it,\" however, an opinion announcing a rule of federal law \"is properly understood to have followed the normal rule of retroactive application\" and must be \"read to hold . . . that its rule should apply retroactively to the litigants then before *98 the Court.\" Beam, 501 U. S., at 539 (opinion of Souter, J.). Accord, id., at 544-545 (White, J., concurring in judgment); id., at 550 (O'Connor, J., dissenting). Furthermore, the legal imperative \"to apply a rule of federal law retroactively after the case announcing the rule has already done so\" must \"prevai[l] over any claim based on a Chevron Oil analysis.\" Id., at 540 (opinion of Souter, J.). In an effort to distinguish Davis, the Supreme Court of Virginia surmised that this Court had \"made no . . . ruling\" about the application of the rule announced in Davis \"retroactively to the litigants in that case.\" 242 Va., at 326, 410 S. E. 2d, at 631. \"[B]ecause the retroactivity issue was not decided in Davis, \" the court believed that it was \"not foreclosed by precedent from applying the three-pronged Chevron Oil test in deciding the retroactivity issue in the present case.\" Ibid. We disagree. Davis did not hold that preferential state tax treatment of state and local employee pensions, though constitutionally invalid in the future, should be upheld as to all events predating the announcement of Davis. The governmental appellee in Davis \"conceded that a refund [would have been] appropriate\" if we were to conclude that \"the Michigan Income Tax Act violate[d] principles of intergovernmental tax immunity by favoring retired state and local governmental employees over retired federal employees.\" 489 U. S., at 817. We stated that \"to the extent appellant has paid taxes pursuant to this invalid tax scheme, he is entitled to a refund.\" Ibid. Far from reserving the retroactivity question, our response to the appellee's concession constituted a retroactive application of the rule announced in Davis to the parties before the Court. Because a decision to accord solely prospective effect to Davis would have foreclosed any discussion of remedial issues, our \"consideration of remedial issues\" meant \"necessarily\" that we retroactively applied the rule we announced in Davis to the litigants before us. Beam, supra, at 539 (opinion of Souter, J.). *99 Therefore, under Griffith, Beam, and the retroactivity approach we adopt today, the Supreme Court of Virginia must apply Davis in petitioners' refund action. III Respondent Virginia Department of Taxation defends the judgment below as resting on an independent and adequate state ground that relieved the Supreme Court of Virginia of any obligation to apply Davis to events occurring before our announcement of that decision. Petitioners had contended that \"even if the Davis decision applie[d] prospectively only,\" they were entitled to relief under Virginia's tax refund statute, Va. Code Ann. § 58.1-1826 (1991). Harper v. Virginia Dept. of Taxation, 241 Va., at 241, 401 S. E. 2d, at 873. The Virginia court rejected their argument. It first reasoned that because Davis did not apply retroactively, tax assessments predating Davis were \"neither erroneous nor improper within the meaning\" of Virginia's tax statute. Ibid. The court then offered \"another reason\" for rejecting petitioners' \"state-law contention\": \"We previously have held that this Court's ruling declaring a taxing scheme unconstitutional is to be applied prospectively only.\" Ibid. (citing Perkins v. Albemarle County, 214 Va. 240, 198 S. E. 2d 626, aff'd and modified on rehearing, 214 Va. 416, 200 S. E. 2d 566 (1973); Capehart v. City of Chesapeake, No. 5459 (Va. Cir. Ct., Oct. 16, 1974), appeal denied, 215 Va. xlvii, cert. denied, 423 U. S. 875 (1975)). The formulation of this state-law retroactivity doctrinethat \"consideration should be given to the purpose of the new rule, the extent of the reliance on the old rule, and the effect on the administration of justice of a retroactive application of the new rule,\" Fountain v. Fountain, 214 Va. 347, 348, 200 S. E. 2d 513, 514 (1973), cert. denied, 416 U. S. 939 (1974), quoted in 241 Va., at 241, 401 S. E. 2d, at 874suggests that the Supreme Court of Virginia has simply incorporated into state law the threepronged analysis of Chevron Oil, 404 U. S., at 106-107, and *100 the criminal retroactivity cases overruled by Griffith, see, e. g., Stovall v. Denno, 388 U. S. 293, 297 (1967). We reject the department's defense of the decision below. The Supremacy Clause, U. S. Const., Art. VI, cl. 2, does not allow federal retroactivity doctrine to be supplanted by the invocation of a contrary approach to retroactivity under state law. Whatever freedom state courts may enjoy to limit the retroactive operation of their own interpretations of state law, see Great Northern R. Co. v. Sunburst Oil & Refining Co., 287 U. S. 358, 364-366 (1932), cannot extend to their interpretations of federal law. See National Mines Corp. v. Caryl, 497 U. S. 922, 923 (1990) (per curiam); Ashland Oil, Inc. v. Caryl, 497 U. S. 916, 917 (1990) (per curiam). We also decline the Department of Taxation's invitation to affirm the judgment as resting on the independent and adequate ground that Virginia's law of remedies offered no \"retrospective refund remedy for taxable years concluded before Davis \" was announced. Brief for Respondent 33. The Virginia Supreme Court's conclusion that the challenged tax assessments were \"neither erroneous nor improper within the meaning\" of the refund statute rested solely on the court's determination that Davis did not apply retroactively. Harper v. Virginia Dept. of Taxation, supra, at 241, 401 S. E. 2d, at 873. Because we have decided that Davis applies retroactively to the tax years at issue in petitioners' refund action, we reverse the judgment below. We do not enter judgment for petitioners, however, because federal law does not necessarily entitle them to a refund. Rather, the Constitution requires Virginia \"to provide relief consistent with federal due process principles.\" American Trucking, 496 U. S., at 181 (plurality opinion). Under the Due Process Clause, U. S. Const., Amdt. 14, § 1, \"a State found to have imposed an impermissibly discriminatory tax retains flexibility in responding to this determination.\" McKesson Corp. v. Division of *101 Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco, Fla. Dept. of Business Regulation, 496 U. S. 18, 39-40 (1990). If Virginia \"offers a meaningful opportunity for taxpayers to withhold contested tax assessments and to challenge their validity in a predeprivation hearing,\" the \"availability of a predeprivation hearing constitutes a procedural safeguard . . . sufficient by itself to satisfy the Due Process Clause.\" Id., at 38, n. 21. On the other hand, if no such predeprivation remedy exists, \"the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment obligates the State to provide meaningful backward-looking relief to rectify any unconstitutional deprivation.\" Id. , at 31 (footnotes omitted).[10] In providing such relief, a State may either award full refunds to those burdened by an unlawful tax or issue some other order that \"create[s] in hindsight a nondiscriminatory scheme.\" Id., at 40. Cf. Davis, 489 U. S., at 818 (suggesting that a State's failure to respect intergovernmental tax immunity could be cured \"either by extending [a discriminatory] tax exemption to retired federal employees . . . or by eliminating the exemption for retired state and local government employees\"). The constitutional sufficiency of any remedy thus turns (at least initially) on whether Virginia law \"provide[s] a[n] [adequate] form of `predeprivation process,' for example, by authorizing taxpayers to bring suit to enjoin imposition of a tax *102 prior to its payment, or by allowing taxpayers to withhold payment and then interpose their objections as defenses in a tax enforcement proceeding.\" McKesson, 496 U. S., at 3637. Because this issue has not been properly presented, we leave to Virginia courts this question of state law and the performance of other tasks pertaining to the crafting of any appropriate remedy. Virginia \"is free to choose which form of relief it will provide, so long as that relief satisfies the minimum federal requirements we have outlined.\" Id., at 51-52. State law may provide relief beyond the demands of federal due process, id., at 52, n. 36, but under no circumstances may it confine petitioners to a lesser remedy, see id., at 44-51. IV We reverse the judgment of the Supreme Court of Virginia, and we remand the case for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. So ordered. Justice Scalia, concurring. I am surprised to see an appeal to stare decisis in today's dissent. In Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989), Justice O'Connor wrote for a plurality that openly rejected settled precedent controlling the scope of retroactivity on collateral review. \"This retroactivity determination,\" the opinion said, \"would normally entail application of the Linkletter [v. Walker, 381 U. S. 618 (1965),] standard, but we believe that our approach to retroactivity for cases on collateral review requires modification.\" Id., at 301. The dissent in Teague was a sort of anticipatory echo of today's dissent, criticizing the plurality for displaying \"infidelity to the doctrine of stare decisis,\" id., at 331 (Brennan, J., dissenting), for \"upset[ting]. . . our time-honored precedents,\" id., at 333, for \"repudiating our familiar approach without regard for the doctrine of stare decisis,\" id., at 345, and for failing \"so much as [to] mention stare decisis,\" id., at 333. *103 I joined the plurality opinion in Teague. Not only did I believe the rule it announced was correct, see Withrow v. Williams, 507 U. S. 680, 717 (1993) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part), but I also believed that abandonment of our prior collateral-review retroactivity rule was fully in accord with the doctrine of stare decisis, which as applied by our Court has never been inflexible. The Teague plurality opinion set forth good reasons for abandoning Linkletter reasons justifying a similar abandonment of Chevron Oil Co. v. Huson, 404 U. S. 97 (1971). It noted, for example, that Linkletter \"ha[d] not led to consistent results,\" Teague, supra, at 302; but neither has Chevron Oil. Proof that what it means is in the eye of the beholder is provided quite nicely by the separate opinions filed today: Of the four Justices who would still apply Chevron Oil, two find Davis v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury, 489 U. S. 803 (1989), retroactive, see post, at 111 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment), two find it not retroactive, see post, at 122 (O'Connor, J., dissenting). Second, the Teague plurality opinion noted that Linkletter had been criticized by commentators, Teague, supra, at 303; but the commentary cited in the opinion criticized not just Linkletter, but the Court's retroactivity jurisprudence in general, of which it considered Chevron Oil an integral part, see Beytagh, Ten Years of Non-Retroactivity: A Critique and a Proposal, 61 Va. L. Rev. 1557, 1558, 1581-1582, 1606 (1975). Other commentary, of course, has also regarded the issue of retroactivity as a general problem of jurisprudence. See, e. g., Fallon & Meltzer, New Law, Non-Retroactivity, and Constitutional Remedies, 104 Harv. L. Rev. 1731 (1991); Schaefer, Prospective Rulings: Two Perspectives, 1982 S. Ct. Rev. 1; Schaefer, The Control of \"Sunbursts\": Techniques of Prospective Overruling, 42 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 631 (1967); Mishkin, Forward: The High Court, The Great Writ, and the Due Process of Time and Law, 79 Harv. L. Rev. 56, 58-72 (1965). *104 Finally, the plurality opinion in Teague justified the departure from Linkletter by implicitly relying on the well-settled proposition that stare decisis has less force where intervening decisions \"have removed or weakened the conceptual underpinnings from the prior decision.\" Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U. S. 164, 173 (1989). Justice O'Connor endorsed the reasoning expressed by Justice Harlan in his separate opinions in Mackey v. United States, 401 U. S. 667 (1971), and Desist v. United States, 394 U. S. 244 (1969), and noted that the Court had already adopted the first part of Justice Harlan's retroactivity views in Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U. S. 314 (1987). See Teague, supra, at 303-305. Again, this argument equallyindeed, even more forcefullysupports reconsideration of Chevron Oil. Griffith returned this Court, in criminal cases, to the traditional view (which I shall discuss at greater length below) that prospective decisionmaking \"violates basic norms of constitutional adjudication.\" Griffith, supra, at 322. One of the conceptual underpinnings of Chevron Oil was that retroactivity presents a similar problem in both civil and criminal contexts. See Chevron Oil, supra, at 106; see also Beytagh, supra, at 1606. Thus, after Griffith, Chevron Oil can be adhered to only by rejecting the reasoning of Chevron Oil  that is, only by asserting that the issue of retroactivity is different in the civil and criminal settings. That is a particularly difficult proof to make, inasmuch as Griffith rested on \"basic norms of constitutional adjudication\" and \"the nature of judicial review.\" 479 U. S., at 322; see also Teague, supra, at 317 (White, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (Griffith \"appear[s] to have constitutional underpinnings\").[1] *105 What most provokes comment in the dissent, however, is not its insistence that today a rigid doctrine of stare decisis forbids tinkering with retroactivity, which four Terms ago did not; but rather the irony of its invoking stare decisis in defense of prospective decisionmaking at all. Prospective decisionmaking is the handmaid of judicial activism, and the born enemy of stare decisis. It was formulated in the heyday of legal realism and promoted as a \"techniqu[e] of judicial lawmaking\" in general, and more specifically as a means of making it easier to overrule prior precedent. B. Levy, Realist Jurisprudence and Prospective Overruling, *106 109 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1 (1960). Thus, the dissent is saying, in effect, that stare decisis demands the preservation of methods of destroying stare decisis recently invented in violation of stare decisis. Contrary to the dissent's assertion that Chevron Oil articulated \"our traditional retroactivity analysis,\" post, at 113, the jurisprudence it reflects \"came into being,\" as Justice Harlan observed, less than 30 years ago with Linkletter v. Walker, 381 U. S. 618 (1965). Mackey, supra, at 676. It is so unancient that one of the current Members of this Court was sitting when it was invented. The true traditional view is that prospective decisionmaking is quite incompatible with the judicial power, and that courts have no authority to engage in the practice. See ante, at 94; James B. Beam Distilling Co. v. Georgia, 501 U. S. 529, 534 (1991) (opinion of Souter, J.); American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith, 496 U. S. 167, 201 (1990) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment); Desist, supra, at 258-259 (Harlan, J., dissenting); Great Northern R. Co. v. Sunburst Oil & Refining Co., 287 U. S. 358, 365 (1932). Linkletter itself recognized that \"[a]t common law there was no authority for the proposition that judicial decisions made law only for the future.\" 381 U. S., at 622-623. And before Linkletter, the academic proponents of prospective judicial decisionmaking acknowledged that their proposal contradicted traditional practice. See, e. g., Levy, supra, at 2, and n. 2; Carpenter, Court Decisions and the Common Law, 17 Colum. L. Rev. 593, 594 (1917). Indeed, the roots of the contrary tradition are so deep that Justice Holmes was prepared to hazard the guess that \"[j]udicial decisions have had retrospective operation for near a thousand years.\" Kuhn v. Fairmont Coal Co., 215 U. S. 349, 372 (1910) (dissenting opinion). Justice O'Connor asserts that \"`[w]hen the Court changes its mind, the law changes with it.' \" Post, at 115 (quoting Beam, supra, at 550 (O'Connor, J., dissenting)). That concept is quite foreign to the American legal and constitutional *107 tradition. It would have struck John Marshall as an extraordinary assertion of raw power. The conception of the judicial role that he possessed, and that was shared by succeeding generations of American judges until very recent times, took it to be \"the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is, \" Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 177 (1803) (emphasis added)not what the law shall be. That original and enduring American perception of the judicial role sprang not from the philosophy of Nietzsche but from the jurisprudence of Blackstone, which viewed retroactivity as an inherent characteristic of the judicial power, a power \"not delegated to pronounce a new law, but to maintain and expound the old one.\" 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries 69 (1765). Even when a \"former determination is most evidently contrary to reason . . . [or] contrary to the divine law,\" a judge overruling that decision would \"not pretend to make a new law, but to vindicate the old one from misrepresentation.\" Id., at 69-70. \"For if it be found that the former decision is manifestly absurd or unjust, it is declared, not that such a sentence was bad law, but that it was not law. \" Id., at 70 (emphases in original). Fully retroactive decisionmaking was considered a principal distinction between the judicial and the legislative power: \"[I]t is said that that which distinguishes a judicial from a legislative act is, that the one is a determination of what the existing law is in relation to some existing thing already done or happened, while the other is a predetermination of what the law shall be for the regulation of all future cases.\" T. Cooley, Constitutional Limitations *91. The critics of the traditional rule of full retroactivity were well aware that it was grounded in what one of them contemptuously called \"another fiction known as the Separation of powers.\" Kocourek, Retrospective Decisions and Stare Decisis and a Proposal, 17 A. B. A. J. 180, 181 (1931). Prospective decisionmaking was known to foe and friend alike as a practical tool of judicial activism, born out of disregard *108 for stare decisis. In the eyes of its enemies, the doctrine \"smack[ed] of the legislative process,\" Mishkin, 79 Harv. L. Rev., at 65, \"encroach[ed] on the prerogatives of the legislative department of government,\" Von Moschzisker, Stare Decisis in Courts of Last Resort, 37 Harv. L. Rev. 409, 428 (1924), removed \"one of the great inherent restraints upon this Court's depart[ing] from the field of interpretation to enter that of lawmaking,\" James v. United States, 366 U. S. 213, 225 (1961) (Black, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part), caused the Court's behavior to become \"assimilated to that of a legislature,\" Kurland, Toward a Political Supreme Court, 37 U. Chi. L. Rev. 19, 34 (1969), and tended \"to cut [the courts] loose from the force of precedent, allowing [them] to restructure artificially those expectations legitimately created by extant law and thereby mitigate the practical force of stare decisis, \" Mackey, 401 U. S., at 680 (Harlan, J., concurring in judgment). All this was not denied by the doctrine's friends, who also viewed it as a device to \"augmen[t] the power of the courts to contribute to the growth of the law in keeping with the demands of society,\" Mallamud, Prospective Limitation and the Rights of the Accused, 56 Iowa L. Rev. 321, 359 (1970), as \"a deliberate and conscious technique of judicial lawmaking,\" Levy, 109 U. Pa. L. Rev., at 6, as a means of \"facilitating more effective and defensible judicial lawmaking,\" id., at 28. Justice Harlan described this Court's embrace of the prospectivity principle as \"the product of the Court's disquietude with the impacts of its fast-moving pace of constitutional innovation,\" Mackey, supra, at 676. The Court itself, however, glowingly described the doctrine as the cause rather than the effect of innovation, extolling it as a \"technique\" providing the \"impetus . . . for the implementation of long overdue reforms.\" Jenkins v. Delaware, 395 U. S. 213, 218 (1969). Whether cause or effect, there is no doubt that the era which gave birth to the prospectivity principle was marked by a newfound disregard for stare decisis. As one *109 commentator calculated, \"[b]y 1959, the number of instances in which the Court had reversals involving constitutional issues had grown to sixty; in the two decades which followed, the Court overruled constitutional cases on no less than forty-seven occasions.\" Maltz, Some Thoughts on the Death of Stare Decisis in Constitutional Law, 1980 Wis. L. Rev. 467. It was an era when this Court cast overboard numerous settled decisions, and indeed even whole areas of law, with an unceremonious \"heave-ho.\" See, e. g., Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S. 643 (1961) (overruling Wolf v. Colorado, 338 U. S. 25 (1949)); Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335 (1963) (overruling Betts v. Brady, 316 U. S. 455 (1942)); Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, 479, n. 48 (1966) (overruling Crooker v. California, 357 U. S. 433 (1958), and Cicenia v. Lagay, 357 U. S. 504 (1958)); Katz v. United States, 389 U. S. 347 (1967) (overruling Olmstead v. United States, 277 U. S. 438 (1928), and Goldman v. United States, 316 U. S. 129 (1942)). To argue now that one of the jurisprudential tools of judicial activism from that period should be extended on grounds of stare decisis can only be described as paradoxical.[2] In sum, I join the opinion of the Court because the doctrine of prospective decisionmaking is not in fact protected *110 by our flexible rule of stare decisis; and because no friend of stare decisis would want it to be. Justice Kennedy, with whom Justice White joins, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment. I remain of the view that it is sometimes appropriate in the civil context to give only prospective application to a judicial decision. \"[P]rospective overruling allows courts to respect the principle of stare decisis even when they are impelled to change the law in light of new understanding.\" American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith, 496 U. S. 167, 197 (1990) (plurality opinion). When a court promulgates a new rule of law, prospective application functions \"to avoid injustice or hardship to civil litigants who have justifiably relied on prior law.\" Id., at 199 (internal quotation marks omitted). See Phoenix v. Kolodziejski, 399 U. S. 204, 213-215 (1970); Cipriano v. City of Houma, 395 U. S. 701, 706 (1969) (per curiam); England v. Louisiana Bd. of Medical Examiners, 375 U. S. 411, 422 (1964). And in my view retroactivity in civil cases continues to be governed by the standard announced in Chevron Oil Co. v. Huson, 404 U. S. 97, 106-107 (1971). Thus, for the reasons explained by Justice O'Connor, post, at 113-117, I cannot agree with the Court's broad dicta, ante, at 95-97, that appears to embrace in the civil context the retroactivity principles adopted for criminal cases in Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U. S. 314 (1987). As Justice O'Connor has demonstrated elsewhere, the differences between the civil and criminal contexts counsel strongly against adoption of Griffith for civil cases. See American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith, supra, at 197-199. I also cannot accept the Court's conclusion, ante, at 96-99, which is based on Justice Souter's opinion in James B. Beam Distilling Co. v. Georgia, 501 U. S. 529, 540-543 (1991), that a decision of this Court must be applied in a retroactive manner simply because the rule of law there announced happened to be applied to the parties then before the Court. *111 See post, at 117-122 (O'Connor, J.,dissenting); James B. Beam Distilling Co. v. Georgia, supra, at 550-552 (O'Connor, J., dissenting). For these reasons, I do not join Part II of the Court's opinion. I nonetheless agree with the Court that Davis v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury, 489 U. S. 803 (1989), must be given retroactive effect. The first condition for prospective application of any decision is that itmust announce a new rule of law. Ashland Oil, Inc. v. Caryl, 497 U. S. 916, 918 (1990) (per curiam); American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith, supra, at 179; United States v. Johnson, 457 U. S. 537, 550, n. 12 (1982); Chevron Oil Co. v. Huson, 404 U. S., at 106-107. The decision must \"overrul[e] clear past precedent on which litigants may have relied\" or \"decid[e] an issue of first impression whose resolution was not clearly foreshadowed.\" Id. , at 106. Because Davis did neither, it did not announce new law and therefore must be applied in a retroactive manner. Respondent argues that two new principles of law were established in Davis. First, it points to the holding that 4 U. S. C. § 111, in which the United States consents to state taxation of the compensation of \"an officer or employee of the United States,\" applies to federal retirees as well as current federal employees. Brief for Respondent 16-18. See Davis, 489 U. S., at 808-810. In Davis, however, we indicated that this holding was \"dictate[d]\" by \"the plain language of the statute,\" id., at 808, and we added for good measure our view that the language of the statute was \"unambiguous,\" \"unmistakable,\" and \"leaves no room for doubt,\" id., at 809, n. 3, 810. Given these characterizations, it is quite implausible to contend that in this regard Davis decided \"an issue of first impression whose resolution was not clearly foreshadowed.\" Chevron Oil, supra, at 106. The second new rule respondent contends the Court announced in Davis was that the state statute at issue discriminated against federal retirees even though the statute treated them like all other state taxpayers except state employees. *112 Brief for Respondent 18-26. See Davis, supra, at 814, 815, n. 4. The Davis Court, however, anchored its decision in precedent. We observed that in Phillips Chemical Co. v. Dumas Independent School Dist., 361 U. S. 376 (1960), \"we faced th[e] precise situation\" confronting us in Davis, and so Phillips Chemical controlled our holding. 489 U. S., at 815, n. 4. To be sure, Justice Stevens in dissent disagreed with these contentions and attempted to distinguish Phillips Chemical. 489 U. S., at 824-826. The Court, however, was not persuaded at the time, and I remain convinced that the Court had the better reading of Phillips Chemical. A contrary holding in Davis, in my view, would have created a clear inconsistency in our jurisprudence. Under Chevron Oil, application of precedent which directly controls is not the stuff of which new law is made. Far from being \"revolutionary,\" Ashland Oil Co. v. Caryl, supra, at 920, or \"an avulsive change which caused the current of the law thereafter to flow between new banks,\" Hanover Shoe, Inc. v. United Shoe Machinery Co., 392 U. S. 481, 499 (1968), Davis was a mere application of plain statutory language and existing precedent. In these circumstances, this Court is not free to mitigate any financial hardship that might befall Virginia's taxpayers as a result of their state government's failure to reach a correct understanding of the unambiguous dictates of federal law. Because I do not believe that Davis v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury, supra, announced a new principle of law, I have no occasion to consider Justice O'Connor's argument, post, at 131-136, that equitable considerations may inform the formulation of remedies when a new rule is announced. In any event, I do not read Part III of the Court's opinion as saying anything inconsistent with what Justice O'Connor proposes. On this understanding, I join Parts I and III of the Court's opinion and concur in its judgment. *113 Justice O'Connor, with whom The Chief Justice joins, dissenting. Today the Court applies a new rule of retroactivity to impose crushing and unnecessary liability on the States, precisely at a time when they can least afford it. Were the Court's decision the product of statutory or constitutional command, I would have no choice but to join it. But nothing in the Constitution or statute requires us to adopt the retroactivity rule the majority now applies. In fact, longstanding precedent requires the opposite result. Because I see no reason to abandon our traditional retroactivity analysis as articulated in Chevron Oil Co. v. Huson, 404 U. S. 97, 106 107 (1971), and because I believe the Supreme Court of Virginia correctly applied Chevron Oil in this case, I would affirm the judgment below. I This Court's retroactivity jurisprudence has become somewhat chaotic in recent years. Three Terms ago, the case of American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith, 496 U. S. 167 (1990), produced three opinions, none of which garnered a majority. One Term later, James B. Beam Distilling Co. v. Georgia, 501 U. S. 529 (1991), yielded five opinions; there, no single writing carried more than three votes. As a result, the Court today finds itself confronted with such disarray that, rather than relying on precedent, it must resort to vote counting: Examining the various opinions in Jim Beam, it discerns six votes for a single proposition that, in its view, controls this case. Ante, at 96-97. If we had given appropriate weight to the principle of stare decisis in the first place, our retroactivity jurisprudence never would have become so hopelessly muddled. After all, it was not that long ago that the law of retroactivity for civil cases was considered well settled. In Chevron Oil Co. , we explained that whether a decision will be nonretroactive depends on whether it announces a new rule, whether prospectivity would undermine the purposes of the *114 rule, and whether retroactive application would produce injustice. 404 U. S., at 106-107. Even when this Court adjusted the retroactivity rule for criminal cases on direct review some six years ago, we reaffirmed the vitality of Chevron Oil, noting that retroactivity in civil cases \"continues to be governed by the standard announced in Chevron Oil Co. v. Huson. \" Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U. S. 314, 322, n. 8 (1987). In American Trucking Assns., supra, however, a number of Justices expressed a contrary view, and the jurisprudential equivalent of entropy immediately took over. Whatever the merits of any retroactivity test, it cannot be denied that resolution of the case before us would be simplified greatly had we not disregarded so needlessly our obligation to follow precedent in the first place. I fear that the Court today, rather than rectifying that confusion, reinforces it still more. In the usual case, of course, retroactivity is not an issue; the courts simply apply their best understanding of current law in resolving each case that comes before them. James B. Beam, 501 U. S., at 534, 535-536 (Souter, J.). But where the law changes in some respect, the courts sometimes may elect not to apply the new law; instead, they apply the law that governed when the events giving rise to the suit took place, especially where the change in law is abrupt and the parties may have relied on the prior law. See id., at 534. This can be done in one of two ways. First, a court may choose to make the decision purely prospective, refusing to apply it not only to the parties before the court but also to any case where the relevant facts predate the decision. Id., at 536. Second, a court may apply the rule to some but not all cases where the operative events occurred before the court's decision, depending on the equities. See id., at 537. The first option is called \"pure prospectivity\" and the second \"selective prospectivity.\" As the majority notes, ante, at 96-97, six Justices in James B. Beam, supra, expressed their disagreement with selective prospectivity. Thus, even though there was no majority *115 opinion in that case, one can derive from that case the proposition the Court announces today: Once \"this Court applies a rule of federal law to the parties before it,that rule .. . must be given full retroactive effect in all cases still open on direct review.\" Ante, at 97. But no decision of this Court forecloses the possibility of pure prospectivityrefusal to apply a new rule in the very case in which it is announced and every case thereafter. As Justice White explained in his concurrence in James B. Beam, \"[t]he propriety of prospective application of decision in this Court, in both constitutional and statutory cases, is settled by our prior decisions.\" 501 U. S., at 546 (opinion concurring in judgment). Rather than limiting its pronouncements to the question of selective prospectivity, the Court intimates that pure prospectivity may be prohibited as well. See ante, at 97 (referring to our lack of \"`constitutional authority . . . to disregard current law' \"); ibid. (relying on \"`basic norms of constitutional adjudication' \" (quoting Griffith, supra, at 322)); see also ante, at 94 (touting the \"fundamental rule of `retrospective operation' \" of judicial decisions). The intimation is incorrect. As I have explained before and will touch upon only briefly here: \"[W]hen the Court changes its mind, the law changes with it. If the Court decides, in the context of a civil case or controversy, to change the law, it must make [a] determination whether the new law or the old is to apply to conduct occurring before the law-changing decision. Chevron Oil describes our long-established procedure for making this inquiry.\" James B. Beam, supra, at 550 (O'Connor, J., dissenting) (internal quotation marks omitted). Nor can the Court's suggestion be squared with our cases, which repeatedly have announced rules of purely prospective effect. See, e. g., Northern Pipeline Constr. Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co., 458 U. S. 50, 88 (1982); Chevron Oil, 404 *116 U. S., at 106-107; Phoenix v. Kolodziejski, 399 U. S. 204, 214 (1970); Cipriano v. City of Houma, 395 U. S. 701, 706 (1969); see also American Trucking Assns., 496 U. S., at 188-200 (plurality opinion) (canvassing the Court's retroactivity jurisprudence); ante, at 110 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (citing cases). In any event, the question of pure prospectivity is not implicated here. The majority first holds that once a rule has been applied retroactively, the rule must be applied retroactively to all cases thereafter. Ante, at 97. Then it holds that Davis v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury, 489 U. S. 803 (1989), in fact retroactively applied the rule it announced. Ante, at 98-99. Under the majority's approach, that should end the matter: Because the Court applied the rule retroactively in Davis, it must do so here as well. Accordingly, there is no reason for the Court's careless dictum regarding pure prospectivity, much less dictum that is contrary to clear precedent. Plainly enough, Justice Scalia would cast overboard our entire retroactivity doctrine with precisely the \"unceremonious `heave-ho' \" he decries in his concurrence. See ante, at 109. Behind the undisguised hostility to an era whose jurisprudence he finds distasteful, Justice Scalia raises but two substantive arguments, both of which were raised in James B. Beam , 501 U. S., at 549 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment), and neither of which has been adopted by a majority of this Court. Justice White appropriately responded to those arguments then, see id., at 546 (opinion concurring in judgment), and there is no reason to repeat the responses now. As Justice Frankfurter explained more than 35 years ago: \"We should not indulge in the fiction that the law now announced has always been the law . . . . It is much more conducive to law's self-respect to recognize candidly the considerations that give prospective content to *117 a new pronouncement of law.\" Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U. S. 12, 26 (1956) (opinion concurring in judgment). II I dissented in James B. Beam because I believed that the absolute prohibition on selective prospectivity was not only contrary to precedent, but also so rigid that it produced unconscionable results. I would have adhered to the traditional equitable balancing test of Chevron Oil as the appropriate method of deciding the retroactivity question in individual cases. But even if one believes the prohibition on selective prospectivity desirable, it seems to me that the Court today takes that judgment to an illogicaland inequitableextreme. It is one thing to say that, where we have considered prospectivity in a prior case and rejected it, we must reject it in every case thereafter. But it is quite another to hold that, because we did not consider the possibility of prospectivity in a prior case and instead applied a rule retroactively through inadvertence, we are foreclosed from considering the issue forever thereafter. Such a rule is both contrary to established precedent and at odds with any notion of fairness or sound decisional practice. Yet that is precisely the rule the Court appears to adopt today. Ante, at 96-97. A Under the Court's new approach, we have neither authority nor discretion to consider the merits of applying Davis v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury, supra, retroactively. Instead, we must inquire whether any of our previous decisions happened to have applied the Davis rule retroactively to the parties before the Court. Deciding whether we in fact have applied Davis retroactively turns out to be a rather difficult matter. Parsing the language of the Davis opinion, the Court encounters a single sentence it declares determinative: \"The State having conceded that a refund is appropriate in *118 these circumstances, see Brief for Appellee 63, to the extent appellant has paid taxes pursuant to this invalid tax scheme, he is entitled to a refund.\" Id., at 817 (quoted in part, ante, at 98). According to the majority, that sentence constitutes \"`consideration of remedial issues' \" and therefore \"`necessarily' \" indicates that we applied the rule in Davis retroactively to the parties before us. Ante, at 98 (quoting James B. Beam, supra, at 539 (opinion of Souter, J.)). Ironically, respondent and its amici draw precisely the opposite conclusion from the same sentence. According to them, the fact that Michigan conceded that it would offer relief meant that we had no reason to decide the question of retroactivity in Davis. Michigan was willing to provide relief whether or not relief was required. The Court simply accepted that offer and preserved the retroactivity question for another day. One might very well debate the meaning of the single sentence on which everyone relies. But the debate is as meaningless as it is indeterminate. In Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U. S. 619 (1993), we reaffirmed our longstanding rule that, if a decision does not \"squarely addres[s] [an] issue,\" this Court remains \"free to address [it] on the merits\" at a later date. Id., at 631. Accord, United States v. L. A. Tucker Truck Lines, Inc., 344 U. S. 33, 38 (1952) (issue not \"raised in briefs or argument nor discussed in the opinion of the Court\" cannot be taken as \"a binding precedent on th[e] point\"); Webster v. Fall, 266 U. S. 507, 511 (1925) (\"Questions which merely lurk in the record, neither brought to the attention of the court nor ruled upon, are not considered as having been so decided as to constitute precedents\"). The rule can be traced back to some of the earliest of this Court's decisions. See statement of Marshall, C. J.,as reported in the arguments of counsel in United States v. More, 3 Cranch 159, 172 (1805) (\"No question was made, in that case, as to the jurisdiction. It passed sub silentio, and the court does not consider itself as bound by that case\"). Regardless of *119 how one reads the solitary sentence upon which the Court relies, surely it does not \"squarely address\" the question of retroactivity; it does not even mention retroactivity. At best, by addressing the question of remedies, the sentence implicitly \"assumes\" the rule in Davis to be retroactive. Our decision in Brecht, however, makes it quite clear that unexamined assumptions do not bind this Court. Brecht, supra, at 631 (That the Court \"assumed the applicability of\" a rule does not bind the Court to the assumption). In fact, there is far less reason to consider ourselves bound by precedent today than there was in Brecht. In Brecht, the issue was not whether a legal question was resolved by a single case; it was whether our consistent practice of applying a particular rule, Chapman v. California, 386 U. S. 18, 24 (1967), to cases on collateral review precluded us from limiting the rule's application to cases on direct review. Because none of our prior cases directly had addressed the applicability of Chapman to cases on collateral revieweach had only assumed it appliedthe Court held that those cases did not bind us to any particular result. See Brecht, supra, at 630-631. I see no reason why a single retroactive application of the Davis rule, inferred from the sparse and ambiguous language of Davis itself, should carry more weight here than our consistent practice did in Brecht. The Court offers no justification for disregarding the settled rule we so recently applied in Brecht. Nor do I believe it could, for the rule is not a procedural nicety. On the contrary, it is critical to the soundness of our decisional processes. It should go without saying that any decision of this Court has wide-ranging applications; nearly every opinion we issue has effects far beyond the particular case in which it issues. The rule we applied in Brecht, which limits the stare decisis effect of our decisions to questions actually considered and passed on, ensures that this Court does not decide important questions by accident or inadvertence. By adopting a contrary rule in the area of retroactivity, the *120 Court now permanently binds itself to its every unexamined assumption or inattention. Any rule that creates a grave risk that we might resolve important issues of national concern sub silentio, without thought or consideration, cannot be a wise one. This case demonstrates the danger of such a rule. The question of retroactivity was never briefed in Davis. It had not been passed upon by the court below. And it was not within the question presented. Indeed, at oral argument we signaled that we would not pass upon the retroactivity of the rule Davis would announce. After conceding that the Michigan Department of Taxation would give Davis himself a refund if he prevailed, counsel for the department argued that it would be unfair to require Michigan to provide refunds to the 24,000 taxpayers who were not before the Court. The following colloquy ensued: \"[Court]: So why do we have to answer that at all? \"[Michigan]: if, if this Court issues an opinion stating that the current Michigan classification is unconstitutional or in violation of the statute, there are these 24,000 taxpayers out there.. . . . . \"[Court]: But that's notit's not here, is it? Is that question here? \"[Michigan]: It is not specifically raised, no.\" Tr. of Oral Arg., O. T. 1988, No. 87-1020, pp. 37-38. Now, however, the Court holds that the question was implicitly before us and that, even though the Davis opinion does not even discuss the question of retroactivity, it resolved the issue conclusively and irretrievably. If Davis somehow did decide that its rule was to be retroactive, it was by chance and not by design. The absence of briefing, argument, or even mention of the question belies any suggestion that the issue was given thoughtful consideration. Even the author of the Davis opinion refuses to accept *121 the notion that Davis resolved the question of retroactivity. Instead, Justice Kennedy applies the analysis of Chevron Oil to resolve the retroactivity question today. See ante, at 110-112 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment). The Court's decision today cannot be justified by comparison to our decision in Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U. S. 314 (1987), which abandoned selective prospectivity in the criminal context. Ante, at 97. As I explained in American Trucking Assns., 496 U. S., at 197-200, there are significant differences between criminal and civil cases that weigh against such an extension. First, nonretroactivity in criminal cases historically has favored the government's reliance interests over the rights of criminal defendants. As a result, the generalized policy of favoring individual rights over governmental prerogative can justify the elimination of prospectivity in the criminal arena. The same rationale cannot apply in civil cases, as nonretroactivity in the civil context does not necessarily favor plaintiffs or defendants; \"nor is there any policy reason for protecting one class of litigants over another.\" Id., at 198. More important, even a party to civil litigation who is \"deprived of the full retroactive benefit of a new decision may receive some relief.\" Id., at 198 199. Here, for example, petitioners received the benefit of prospective invalidation of Virginia's taxing scheme. From this moment forward, they will be treated on an equal basis with all other retirees, the very treatment our intergovernmental immunity cases require. The criminal defendant, in contrast, is usually interested only in one remedyreversal of his conviction. That remedy can be obtained only if the rule is applied retroactively. See id. , at 199. Nor can the Court's rejection of selective retroactivity in the civil context be defended on equal treatment grounds. See Griffith, supra, at 323 (selective retroactivity accords a benefit to the defendant in whose case the decision is announced but not to any defendant thereafter). It may well *122 be that there is little difference between the criminal defendant in whose case a decision is announced and the defendant who seeks certiorari on the same question two days later. But in this case there is a tremendous difference between the defendant in whose case the Davis rule was announced and the defendant who appears before us today: The latter litigated and preserved the retroactivity question while the former did not. The Michigan Department of Taxation did not even brief the question of retroactivity in Davis. Respondent, in contrast, actually prevailed on the question in the court below. If the Court is concerned with equal treatment, that difference should be dispositive. Having failed to demand the unusual, prospectivity, respondent in Davis got the usual namely, retroactivity. Respondent in this case has asked for the unusual. In fact, respondent here defends a judgment below that awarded it just that. I do not see how the principles of equality can support forcing the Commonwealth of Virginia to bear the harsh consequences of retroactivity simply because, years ago, the Michigan Department of Taxation failed to press the issueand we neglected to consider it. Instead, the principles of fairness favor addressing the contentions the Virginia Department of Taxation presses before us by applying Chevron Oil today. It is therefore to Chevron Oil that I now turn. B Under Chevron Oil, whether a decision of this Court will be applied nonretroactively depends on three factors. First, as a threshold matter, \"the decision to be applied nonretroactively must establish a new principle of law.\" 404 U. S., at 106. Second, nonretroactivity must not retard the new rule's operation in light of its history, purpose, and effect. Id., at 107. Third, nonretroactivity must be necessary to avoid the substantial injustice and hardship that a holding of retroactivity might impose. Ibid. In my view, all three factors favor holding our decision in Davis nonretroactive. *123 1 As Justice Kennedy points out in his concurrence, ante, at 111, a decision cannot be made nonretroactive unless it announces \"a new principle of law.\" Chevron Oil, 404 U. S., at 106. For purposes of civil retroactivity, Chevron Oil identifies two types of decisions that can be new. First, a decision is new if it overturns \"clear past precedent on which litigants may have relied.\" Ibid.; ante, at 111 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). I agree with Justice Kennedy that Davis did not represent such a \"`revolutionary' \" or \"`avulsive change' \" in the law. Ante, at 112 (quoting Hanover Shoe, Inc. v. United Shoe Machinery Corp., 392 U. S. 481, 499 (1968)). Nonetheless, Chevron also explains that a decision may be \"new\" if it resolves \"an issue of first impression whose resolution was not clearly foreshadowed.\" Chevron Oil, supra, at 106 (emphasis added). Thus, even a decision that is \"controlled by the . . . principles\" articulated in precedent may announce a new rule, so long as the rule was \"sufficiently debatable\" in advance. Arizona Governing Comm. for Tax Deferred Annuity and Deferred Compensation Plans v. Norris, 463 U. S. 1073, 1109 (1983) (O'Connor, J., concurring). Reading the Davis opinion alone, one might get the impression that it did not announce a new rule even of that variety. The opinion's emphatic language suggests that the outcome was not even debatable. See ante, at 111 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). In my view, however, assertive language is not itself determinative. As The Chief Justice explained for the Court in a different context: \"[T]he fact that a court says that its decision . . . is `controlled' by a prior decision, is not conclusive for purposes of deciding whether the current decision is a `new rule' . . . . Courts frequently view their decisions as being `controlled' or `governed' by prior opinions even *124 when aware of reasonable contrary conclusions reached by other courts.\" Butler v. McKellar, 494 U. S. 407, 415 (1990). In Butler, we determined that the rule announced in Arizona v. Roberson, 486 U. S. 675 (1988), was \"new\" for purposes of Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989), despite Roberson `s repeated assertions that its rule was \"directly controlled\" by precedent. Indeed, we did not even feel bound by the opinion's statement that it was not announcing a new rule at all but rather declining to create an exception to an existing rule. While Teague and its progeny may not provide the appropriate standard of novelty for Chevron Oil purposes, their teachingthat whether an opinion is new depends not on its language or tone but on the legal landscape from which it aroseobtains nonetheless. In any event, Justice Stevens certainly thought that Davis announced a new rule. In fact, he thought that the rule was not only unprecedented, but wrong: \"The Court's holding is not supported by the rationale for the intergovernmental immunity doctrine and is not compelled by our previous decisions. I cannot join the unjustified, court-imposed restriction on a State's power to administer its own affairs.\" 489 U. S., at 818-819 (dissenting opinion). And just last Term two Members of this Court expressed their disagreement with the decision in Davis, labeling its application of the doctrine of intergovernmental immunity \"perverse.\" Barker v. Kansas, 503 U. S. 594, 606 (1992) (Stevens, J., joined by Thomas, J., concurring). Although I would not call our decision in Davis perverse, I agree that its rule was sufficiently debatable in advance as to fall short of being \"clearly foreshadowed.\" The great weight of authority is in accord.[*] *125 In fact, before Davis was announced, conventional wisdom seemed to be directly to the contrary. One would think that, if Davis was \"clearly foreshadowed,\" some taxpayer might have made the intergovernmental immunity argument before. No one had. Twenty-three States had taxation schemes just like the one at issue in Davis; and some of those schemes were established as much as half a century before Davis was decided. See Harper v. Virginia Dept. of Taxation, 241 Va. 232, 237, 401 S. E. 2d 868, 871 (1991). Yet not a single taxpayer ever challenged one of those schemes on intergovernmental immunity grounds until Davis challenged Michigan's in 1984. If Justice Holmes is correct that \"[t]he prophecies of what the courts will do in fact, and nothing more pretentious\" are \"law,\" O. Holmes, The Path of the Law, in Collected Legal Papers 167, 173 (1920), then surely Davis announced new law; the universal \"prophecy\" before Davis seemed to be that such taxation schemes were valid. An examination of the decision in Davis and its predecessors reveals that Davis was anything but clearly foreshadowed. Of course, it was well established long before Davis that the nondiscrimination principle of 4 U. S. C. § 111 and the doctrine of intergovernmental immunity prohibit a State from imposing a discriminatory tax on the United States or *126 those who do business with it. The income tax at issue in Davis, however, did not appear discriminatory on its face. Like the Virginia income tax at issue here, it did not single out federal employees or retirees for disfavored treatment. Instead, federal retirees were treated identically to all other retirees, with a single and numerically insignificant exceptionretirees whose retirement benefits were paid by the State. Whether such an exception rendered the tax \"discriminatory\" within the meaning of the intergovernmental immunity doctrine, it seems to me, was an open question. On the one hand, the tax scheme did distinguish between federal retirees and state retirees: The former were required to pay state taxes on their retirement income, while the latter were not. But it was far from clear that such was the proper comparison. In fact, there were strong arguments that it was not. As Justice Stevens explained more thoroughly in his Davis dissent, 489 U. S., at 819and as we have recognized since McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316 (1819)intergovernmental immunity is necessary to prevent the States from interfering with federal interests through taxation. Because the National Government has no recourse to the state ballot box, it has only a limited ability to protect itself against excessive state taxes. But the risk of excessive taxation of federal interests is eliminated, and \"[a] `political check' is provided, when a state tax falls\" not only on the Federal Government, but also \"on a significant group of state citizens who can be counted upon to use their votes to keep the State from raising the tax excessively, and thus placing an unfair burden on the Federal Government.\" Washington v. United States, 460 U. S. 536, 545 (1983) (emphasis added). Accord, United States v. County of Fresno, 429 U. S. 452, 462-464 (1977); South Carolina v. Baker, 485 U. S. 505, 526, n. 15 (1988). There can be no doubt that the taxation scheme at issue in Davis and the one employed by the Commonwealth of *127 Virginia provided that necessary \"political check.\" They exempted only a small group of citizens, state retirees, while subjecting the remainder of their citizensfederal retirees, retirees who receive income from private sources, and nonretirees aliketo a uniform income tax. As a result, any attempt to increase income taxes excessively so as to interfere with federal interests would have caused the similarly taxed populace to \"use their votes\" to protect their interests, thereby protecting the interests of the Federal Government as well. There being no risk of abusive taxation of the National Government, there was a good argument that there should have been no intergovernmental immunity problem either. See Davis, 489 U. S., at 821-824 (Stevens, J., dissenting). In addition, distinguishing between taxation of state retirees and all others, including private and federal retirees, was justifiable from an economic standpoint. The State, after all, does not merely collect taxes from its retirees; it pays their benefits as well. As a result, it makes no difference to the State or the retirees whether the State increases state retirement benefits in an amount sufficient to cover taxes it imposes, or whether the State offers reduced benefits and makes them tax free. The net income level of the retirees and the impact on the state fisc is the same. Thus, the Michigan Department of Taxation had a good argument that its differential treatment of state and federal retirees was \"directly related to, and justified by, [a] significant differenc[e] between the two classes,\" id., at 816 (internal quotation marks omitted): Taxing federal retirees enhances the State's fisc, whereas taxing state retirees does not. I recite these arguments not to show that the decision in Davis was wrongI joined the opinion then and remain of the view that it was correctbut instead to point out that the arguments on the other side were substantial. Of course, the Court was able to \"ancho[r] its decision in precedent,\" ante, at 112 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring *128 in judgment). But surely that cannot be dispositive. Few decisions are so novel that there is no precedent to which they may be moored. What is determinative is that the decision was \"sufficiently debatable\" ex ante that, under Chevron Oil, nonretroactivity cannot be precluded. Arizona Governing Committee v. Norris, 463 U. S., at 1109 (O'Connor, J., concurring). That, it seems to me, is the case here. 2 The second Chevron Oil factor is whether denying the rule retroactive application will retard its operation in light of the rule's history, purpose, and effect. 404 U. S., at 107. That factor overwhelmingly favors respondent. The purpose of the intergovernmental immunity doctrine is to protect the rights of the Federal Sovereign against state interference. It does not protect the private rights of individuals: \"[T]he purpose of the immunity was not to confer benefits on the employees by relieving them from contributing their share of the financial support of the other government . . . , but to prevent undue interference with the one government by imposing on it the tax burdens of the other.\" Graves v. New York ex rel. O'Keefe, 306 U. S. 466, 483-484 (1939) (footnote omitted). Accord, Davis, supra, at 814 (\"[I]ntergovernmental tax immunity is based on the need to protect each sovereign's governmental operations from undue interference by the other\"). Affording petitioners retroactive relief in this case would not vindicate the interests of the Federal Government. Instead, it lines the pockets of the Government's former employees. It therefore comes as no surprise that the United States, despite its consistent participation in intergovernmental immunity cases in the past, has taken no position here. Because retroactive application of the rule in Davis serves petitioners' interests but not the interests intergovernmental *129 immunity was meant to protectthe Federal Government'sdenying Davis retroactive application would not undermine the decision's purpose or effect. 3 The final factor under Chevron Oil is whether the decision \"`could produce substantial inequitable results if applied retroactively.' \" Chevron Oil, supra, at 107 (quoting Cipriano v. City of Houma, 395 U. S., at 706). We repeatedly have declined to give our decisions retroactive effect where doing so would be unjust. In Arizona Governing Committee v. Norris, supra, for example, we declined to apply a Title VII decision retroactively, noting that the resulting \"unanticipated financial burdens would come at a time when many States and local governments are struggling to meet substantial fiscal deficits.\" Id., at 1106-1107 (Powell, J., joined by Burger, C. J., Blackmun, Rehnquist, and O'Connor, JJ.). There was \"no justification\" for \"impos[ing] this magnitude of burden retroactively on the public,\" we concluded. Id., at 1107. Accord, id., at 1107-1111 (O'Connor, J., concurring); see id., at 1075 (per curiam). Similarly, we declined to afford the plaintiff full retroactive relief in Los Angeles Dept. of Water and Power v. Manhart, 435 U. S. 702, 718-723 (1978) (Stevens, J.). There, too, we explained that \"[r]etroactive liability could be devastating\" and that \"[t]he harm would fall in large part on innocent third parties.\" Id. , at 722-723. Those same considerations exist here. Retroactive application of rulings that invalidate state tax laws have the potential for producing \"disruptive consequences for the State[s] and [their] citizens. A refund, if required by state or federal law, could deplete the state treasur[ies], thus threatening the State[s'] current operations and future plans.\" American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith, 496 U. S., at 182 (plurality opinion). Retroactive application of Davis is no exception. \"The fiscal implications of Davis for the *130 [S]tates,\" one commentator has noted, \"are truly staggering.\" Hellerstein, Preliminary Reflections on McKesson and American Trucking Associations, 48 Tax Notes 325, 336 (1990). The States estimate that their total liability will exceed $1.8 billion. Brief for Respondent SA-1; Brief for State of Utah et al. as Amici Curiae 12-13. Virginia's share alone exceeds $440 million. Brief for Respondent SA-1; Brief for State of Utah et al. as Amici Curiae 12-13. This massive liability could not come at a worse time. See Wall Street Journal, July 27, 1992, p. A2 (\"Most states are in dire fiscal straits, and their deteriorating tax base is making it harder for them to get out, a survey of legislatures indicates\"). Accord, Harper v. Virginia Dept. of Taxation, 241 Va., at 239-240, 401 S. E. 2d, at 873 (such massive liability \"would have a potentially disruptive and destructive impact on the Commonwealth's planning, budgeting, and delivery of essential state services\"); Swanson v. State, 329 N. C. 576, 583, 407 S. E. 2d 791, 794 (1991) (\"this State is in dire financial straits\" and $140 million in refunds would exacerbate it); Bass v. State, 302 S. C. 250, 256, 395 S. E. 2d 171, 174 (1990) ($200 million in refunds \"would impose a severe financial burden on the State and its citizens [and] endanger the financial integrity of the State\"). To impose such liability on Virginia and the other States that relied in good faith on their taxation laws, \"at a time when most States are struggling to fund even the most basic services, is the height of unfairness.\" James B. Beam, 501 U. S., at 558 (O'Connor, J., dissenting). It cannot be contended that such a burden is justified by the States' conduct, for the liability is entirely disproportionate to the offense. We do not deal with a State that willfully violated the Constitution but rather one that acted entirely in good faith on the basis of an unchallenged statute. Moreover, during the four years in question, the constitutional violation produced a benefit of approximately $8 million to $12 million per year, Tr. of Oral Arg. 33, 36, and that benefit accrued not to the Commonwealth but to individual retirees. *131 Yet, for that $32 million to $48 million error, the Court now allows the imposition of liability well in excess of $400 million dollars. Such liability is more than just disproportionate; it is unconscionable. Finally and perhaps most important, this burden will not fall on some thoughtless government official or even the group of retirees that benefited from the offending exemption. Instead the burden falls squarely on the backs of the blameless and unexpecting taxpayers of the affected States who, although they profited not at all from the exemption, will now be forced to pay higher taxes and be deprived of essential services. Petitioners, in contrast, would suffer no hardship if the Court refused to apply Davis retroactively. For years, 23 States enforced taxation schemes like the Commonwealth's in good faith, and for years not a single taxpayer objected on intergovernmental immunity grounds. No one put the States on notice that their taxing schemes might be constitutionally suspect. Denying Davis retroactive relief thus would not deny petitioners a benefit on which they had relied. It merely would deny them an unanticipated windfall. Because that windfall would come only at the cost of imposing hurtful consequences on innocent taxpayers and the communities in which they live, I believe the substantial inequity of imposing retroactive relief in this case, like the other Chevron factors, weighs in favor of denying Davis retroactive application. III Even if the Court is correct that Davis must be applied retroactively in this case, there is the separate question of the remedy that must be given. The questions of retroactivity and remedy are analytically distinct. American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith, supra, at 189 (plurality opinion) (\"[T]he Court has never equated its retroactivity principles with remedial principles\"). As Justice Souter explained in James B. Beam, supra, at 534, retroactivity is a matter of choice of law \"[s]ince the question is whether the court *132 should apply the old rule or the new one.\" When the retroactivity of a decision of this Court is in issue, the choice-oflaw issue is a federal question. Ashland Oil, Inc. v. Caryl, 497 U. S. 916, 918 (1990) (per curiam). The question of remedy, however, is quite different. The issue is not whether to apply new law or old law, but what relief should be afforded once the prevailing party has been determined under applicable law. See James B. Beam, 501 U. S., at 535 (Souter, J.) (\"Once a rule is found to apply `backward,' there may then be a further issue of remedies, i. e., whether the party prevailing under a new rule should obtain the same relief that would have been awarded if the rule had been an old one\"). The question of remedies is in the first instance a question of state law. See ibid. (\"[T]he remedial inquiry is one governed by state law, at least where the case originates in state court\"). In fact, the only federal question regarding remedies is whether the relief afforded is sufficient to comply with the requirements of due process. See McKesson Corp. v. Division of Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco, Fla. Dept. of Business Regulation, 496 U. S. 18, 31-52 (1990). While the issue of retroactivity is properly before us, the question of remedies is not. It does not appear to be within the question presented, which asks only if Davis may be applied \"nonretroactively so as to defeat federal retirees' entitlement to refunds.\" Pet. for Cert. i. Moreover, our consideration of the question at this juncture would be inappropriate, as the Supreme Court of Virginia has yet to consider what remedy might be available in light of Davis ` retroactivity and applicable state law. The Court inexplicably discusses the question at length nonetheless, noting that if the Commonwealth of Virginia provides adequate predeprivation remedies, it is under no obligation to provide full retroactive refunds today. Ante, at 100-102. When courts take it upon themselves to issue helpful guidance in dictum, they risk creating additional confusion by *133 inadvertently suggesting constitutional absolutes that do not exist. The Court's dictum today follows that course. Amidst its discussion of predeprivation and postdeprivation remedies, the Court asserts that a plaintiff who has been deprived a predeprivation remedy cannot be \"confine[d] . . . to prospective relief.\" Ante, at 101, n. 10. I do not believe the Court's assertion to be correct. Over 20 years ago, Justice Harlan recognized that the equities could be taken into account in determining the appropriate remedy when the Court announces a new rule of constitutional law: \"To the extent that equitable considerations, for example, `reliance,' are relevant, I would take this into account in the determination of what relief is appropriate in any given case. There are, of course, circumstances when a change in the law will jeopardize an edifice which was reasonably constructed on the foundation of prevailing legal doctrine.\" United States v. Estate of Don- nelly, 397 U. S. 286, 296 (1970) (concurring opinion). The commentators appear to be in accord. See Fallon & Meltzer, New Law, Non-Retroactivity, and Constitutional Remedies, 104 Harv. L. Rev. 1733 (1991) (urging consideration of novelty and hardship as part of the remedial framework rather than as a question of whether to apply old law or new). In my view, and in light of the Court's revisions to the law of retroactivity, it should be constitutionally permissible for the equities to inform the remedial inquiry. In a particularly compelling case, then, the equities might permit a State to deny taxpayers a full refund despite having refused them predeprivation process. Indeed, some Members of this Court have argued that we recognized as much long ago. In American Trucking Assns., 496 U. S., at 219-224 (dissenting opinion), Justice Stevens admitted that this Court repeatedly had applied the Chevron Oil factors to preclude the provision of monetary *134 relief. In Justice Stevens' view, however, Chevron Oil determined the question of remedy rather than which law would apply, new or old. See 496 U. S., at 220 (Chevron Oil and its progeny \"establish a remedial principle for the exercise of equitable discretion by federal courts and not, as the plurality states, a choice-of-law principle applicable to all cases on direct review\"); see also ante, at 95, n. 9 (reserving the possibility that Chevron Oil governs the question of remedies in federal court). If Justice Stevens' view or something like it has prevailed todayand it seems that it hasthen state and federal courts still retain the ability to exercise their \"equitable discretion\" in formulating appropriate relief on a federal claim. After all, it would be wholly anomalous to suggest that federal courts are permitted to determine the scope of the remedy by reference to Chevron Oil, but that state courts are barred from considering the equities altogether. Not only would that unduly restrict state court \"flexibility in the law of remedies,\" Estate of Donnelly, supra, at 297 (Harlan, J., concurring), but it also would turn federalism on its head. I know of no principle of law that permits us to restrict the remedial discretion of state courts without imposing similar restrictions on federal courts. Quite the opposite should be true, as the question of remedies in state court is generally a question of state law in the first instance. James B. Beam, 501 U. S., at 535 (Souter, J.). The Court cites only a single case that might be read as precluding courts from considering the equities when selecting the remedy for the violation of a novel constitutional rule. That case is McKesson Corp. v. Division of Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco, supra. Ante, at 101-102. But, as the controlling opinion in James B. Beam explains, McKesson cannot be so read. 501 U. S., at 544 (\"Nothing we say here [precludes the right] to raise procedural bars to recovery under state law or demonstrate reliance interests entitled to consideration in determining the nature of the remedy that must be provided, a matter with which McKes- *135 son did not deal \" (emphases added)). Accord, id., at 543 (\"[N]othing we say here precludes consideration of individual equities when deciding remedial issues in particular cases\"). It is true that the Court in McKesson rejected, on due process grounds, the State of Florida's equitable arguments against the requirement of a full refund. But the opinion did not hold that those arguments were irrelevant as a categorical matter. It simply held that the equities in that case were insufficient to support the decision to withhold a remedy. The opinion expressly so states, rejecting the State's equitable arguments as insufficiently \"weighty in these circumstances. \" McKesson, 496 U. S., at 45 (emphasis added). The circumstances in McKesson were quite different than those here. In McKesson, the tax imposed was patently unconstitutional: The State of Florida collected taxes under its Liquor Tax statute even though this Court already had invalidated a \"virtually identical\" tax. Id., at 46. Given that the State could \"hardly claim surprise\" that its statute was declared invalid, this Court concluded that the State's reliance on the presumptive validity of its statute was insufficient to preclude monetary relief. Ibid. As we explained in American Trucking Assns., the large burden of retroactive relief is \"largely irrelevant when a State violates constitutional norms well established under existing precedent.\" We cited McKesson as an example. 496 U. S., at 183 (plurality opinion). A contrary reading of McKesson would be anomalous in light of this Court's immunity jurisprudence. The Federal Government, for example, is absolutely immune from suit absent an express waiver of immunity; and federal officers enjoy at least qualified immunity when sued in a Bivens action. Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388 (1971). As a result, an individual who suffers a constitutional deprivation at the hands of a federal officer very well may have no access to backwards-looking (monetary) relief. I do not see why the Due Process Clause would *136 require a full, backwards-looking compensatory remedy whenever a governmental official reasonably taxes a citizen under what later turns out to be an unconstitutional statute but not where the officer deprives a citizen of her bodily integrity or her life. In my view, ifthe Court is going to restrict authority to temper hardship by holding our decisions nonretroactive through the Chevron Oil factors, it must afford courts the ability to avoid injustice by taking equity into account when formulating the remedy for violations of novel constitutional rules. See Fallon & Meltzer, 104 Harv. L. Rev. 1733 (1991). Surely the Constitution permits this Court to refuse plaintiffs full backwards-looking relief under Chevron Oil; we repeatedly have done so in the past. American Trucking Assns., supra, at 188-200 (canvassing the Court's practice); see also supra, at 115-116, 129. I therefore see no reason why it would not similarly permit state courts reasonably to consider the equities in the exercise of their sound remedial discretion. IV In my view, the correct approach to the retroactivity question before us was articulated in Chevron Oil some 22 years ago. By refusing to apply Chevron Oil today, the Court not only permits the imposition of grave and gratuitous hardship on the States and their citizens, but also disregards settled precedents central to the fairness and accuracy of our decisional processes. Nor does the Court cast any light on the nature of the regime that will govern from here on. To the contrary, the Court's unnecessary innuendo concerning pure prospectivity and ill-advised dictum regarding remedial issues introduce still greater uncertainty and disorder into this already chaotic area. Because I cannot agree with the Court's decision or the manifestly unjust results it appears to portend, I respectfully dissent.

[9] We need not debate whether Chevron Oil represents a true \"choice-oflaw principle\" or merely \"a remedial principle for the exercise of equitable discretion by federal courts.\" American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith, 496 U. S. 167, 220 (1990) (Stevens, J., dissenting). Compare id., at 191 197 (plurality opinion) (treating Chevron Oil as a choice-of-law rule), with id., at 218-224 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (treating Chevron Oil as a remedial doctrine). Regardless of how Chevron Oil is characterized, our decision today makes it clear that \"the Chevron Oil test cannot determine the choice of law by relying on the equities of the particular case\" and that the federal law applicable to a particular case does not turn on \"whether [litigants] actually relied on [an] old rule [or] how they would suffer from retroactive application\" of a new one. James B. Beam Distilling Co. v. Georgia, 501 U. S. 529, 543 (1991) (opinion of Souter, J.). [10] A State incurs this obligation when it \"places a taxpayer under duress promptly to pay a tax when due and relegates him to a postpayment refund action in which he can challenge the tax's legality.\" McKesson, 496 U. S., at 31. A State that \"establish[es] various sanctions and summary remedies designed\" to prompt taxpayers to \"tender . . . payments before their objections are entertained and resolved\" does not provide taxpayers \"a meaningful opportunity to withhold payment and to obtain a predeprivation determination of the tax assessment's validity.\" Id., at 38 (emphasis in original). Such limitations impose constitutionally significant \"`duress'\" because a tax payment rendered under these circumstances must be treated as an effort \"to avoid financial sanctions or a seizure of real or personal property.\" Id., at 38, n. 21. The State accordingly may not confine a taxpayer under duress to prospective relief. [1] The dissent attempts to distinguish between retroactivity in civil and criminal settings on three grounds, none of which has ever been adopted by this Court. The dissent's first argument begins with the observation that \"nonretroactivity in criminal cases historically has favored the government's reliance interests over the rights of criminal defendants.\" Post, at 121. But while it is true that prospectivity was usually employed in the past (during the brief period when it was used in criminal cases) to favor the government, there is no basis for the implicit suggestion that it would usually favor the government in the future. That phenomenon was a consequence, not of the nature of the doctrine, cf. James v. United States, 366 U. S. 213 (1961), but of the historical \"accident\" that during the period prospectivity was in fashion legal rules favoring the government were more frequently overturned. But more fundamentally, to base a rule of full retroactivity in the criminal-law area upon what the dissent calls \"the generalized policy of favoring individual rights over governmental prerogative,\" post, at 121, makes no more sense than to adopt, because of the same \"generalized policy,\" a similarly gross rule that no decision favoring criminal defendants can ever be overruled. The law is more discerning than that. The dissent's next argument is based on the dubious empirical assumption that civil litigants, but not criminal defendants, will often receive some benefit from a prospective decision. That assumption does not hold even in this case: Prospective invalidation of Virginia's taxing scheme would afford petitioners the enormous future \"benefit,\" ibid., of knowing that others in the State are being taxed more. But empirical problems aside, the dissent does not explain why, if a receipt-of-some-benefit principle is important, we should use such an inaccurate proxy as the civil/criminal distinction, or how this newly discovered principle overcomes the \"basic norms of constitutional adjudication\" on which Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U. S. 314, 322 (1987), rested. Finally, the dissent's \"equal treatment\" argument ably distinguishes between cases in which a prospectivity claim is properly raised, and those in which it is not. See post, at 122. But that does nothing to distinguish between civil and criminal cases; obviously, a party may procedurally default on a claim in either context. [2] Contrary to the suggestion in the dissent, I am not arguing that we should \"cast overboard our entire retroactivity doctrine with . . . [an] unceremonious heave-ho.\" Post, at 116 (emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted). There is no need. We cast over the first half six Terms ago in Griffith, and deep-sixed most of the rest two Terms ago in James B. Beam Distilling Co. v. Georgia, 501 U. S.529 (1991)in neither case unceremoniously (in marked contrast to some of the overrulings cited in text). What little, if any, remains is teetering at the end of the plank and needs no more than a gentle nudge. But if the entire doctrine had been given a quick and unceremonious end, there could be no complaint on the grounds of stare decisis; as it was born, so should it die. I do not know the basis for the dissent's contention that I find the jurisprudence of the era that produced the doctrine of prospectivity \"distasteful.\" Post, at 116. Much of it is quite appetizing. It is only the cavalier treatment of stare decisis and the invention of prospectivity that I have criticized here. [*] Swanson v.
