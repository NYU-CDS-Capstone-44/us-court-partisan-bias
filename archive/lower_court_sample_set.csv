CLEMENT, J.*
Defendants herein demurred to plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs complaint on the ground that it fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend and entered judgment for defendants. Plaintiff appeals.
In the complaint the following facts are alleged:
The 1952 Fresno County grand jury made court approved contract on April 28,1952, with defendants to examine books, records and accounts as authorized by Penal Code, section 928. The agreed compensation was not to exceed the sum of $10,000 Ã¢ÂÂprovided that in case it appeared reasonable *Supp. 890and expedient to continue any audit or investigation past the limit of $10,000 the same might be done only on the approval of the Grand Jury and the Superior Court.Ã¢ÂÂ
Thereafter without court approved agreement for additional compensation defendants rendered their claim for $1,516.07 in excess of the agreed maximum of $10,000. The complaint further alleges that defendants Ã¢ÂÂentered upon an examination and investigation of the equipment needs of certain offices of the County of FresnoÃ¢ÂÂand upon completion thereof rendered their claim and bill in the sum of $749.91 for such investigation and the expenses of travel in connection therewith . . .
Ã¢ÂÂThat thereafter . . . and on the 26th day of January, 1953, Honorable Strother P. Walton, Judge of the Superior Court of the State of California, in and for the County of Fresno issued an order increasing the amount authorized in the said contract aforesaid from the $10,000 limit therein contained to $12,265.98, which said amount of increase included both the additional sum of $1,516.07 as and for an examination of the books, records and accounts herein referred to and the sum of $749.91 for the special examination and investigation of the equipment needs hereinabove referred to . . .
Ã¢ÂÂThat on the 26th day of January, 1953 (the same day and presumably at the same time and as a part of the same official act) the Honorable Strother P. Walton, Judge of the Superior Court issued his written order directing the auditor of the County of Fresno to pay to said defendants the sum of $5,284.32, which sadd sum included both the sum of $1,516.07 and the sum of $749.91 hereinabove referred to.Ã¢ÂÂ
Thereafter pursuant to the written order of the court said sums were paid by the auditor. The judgment prays for the return to the county of $2,269.98 unlawfully paid and $453.19 damages.
Unfortunately the order increasing the amount to be paid and the order directing payment were not set out in the complaint m haec verba, but it is a fair inference from the allegations of the complaint that the order for an increase and the order for payment constituted one official act and in legal contemplation but one order.
Appellant contends that the claims of the defendants, insofar as they exceeded the amount provided for in the original contract of employment as approved by the superior court are illegal and not proper county charges. It further contends *Supp. 891that the mere fact that the moneys herein sued for were paid by the treasurer under an order of the court increasing the amount of grand jury contract, and an order directing that payment does not foreclose an action of this kind to recover the same. Appellant also contends that even if the order to pay referred to in the complaint is determined to be a Ã¢ÂÂjudicial orderÃ¢ÂÂ of the court, it may, nevertheless, be attacked in an action of this nature.
Respondents contend that the order of the court was a Ã¢ÂÂjudicial orderÃ¢ÂÂ and that such an order may not be the subject of collateral attack unless the invalidity of the order appears on its face.
The sole point involved in this appeal and. to be determined by this court is whether or not the judge of the superior court had jurisdiction to make the order of the 26th of January, 1953 pursuant to section 928 of the Penal Code, which will be considered in detail later in this opinion.
A collateral attack on a judgment is an attempt to impeach a judgment by matters dehors the record in an action other than that in which it was rendered. It is an attempt to avoid the effect of a judgment or order perhaps made in some other proceeding. (Clark v. Deschamps, 109 Cal.App.2d 765 at 769 [241 P.2d 681]; Nielsen v. Emerson, 119 Cal.App. 214 [6 P.2d 281]; Rico v. Nasser Bros. Realty Co., 58 Cal.App.2d 878 [137 P.2d 861].)
A direct attack is one within the proceeding itself, taken within the time and according to the plan provided by law; for example, motions for a new trial, appeal and motions to set aside the judgment in the manner provided by Code of Civil Procedure, section 473. (City of Los Angeles v. Glassell, 203 Cal. 44 at 49 [262 P. 1084]; Macbeth v. Macbeth, 219 Cal. 47 [25 P.2d 11].)
Insofar as judgments which do not show invalidity on their face are concerned, the main difference between the direct and collateral attack is that in the direct attack the true facts may be shown, while in the ease of collateral attack we are confined to the inspection of a record conclusively presumed to be correct. (City of Los Angeles v. Glassell, supra.)
Before 1917 a judge of the superior court had no auditing power respecting claims of this character, and could not compel, by direct order, that the auditor draw warrants for payment of the same. (Woody v. Peairs, 35 Cal.App. 553 [170 P. 660]; White v. Mathews, 29 Cal.App. 634 [156 P. 372].)
*Supp. 892In 1917 there was, however, added to section 928, as it then stood, the following language: Ã¢ÂÂAny and all expenses incurred under this section, and also the per diem and mileage where allowed by law, of the grand jurors, shall be paid by the Treasurer of the County out of the general fund of said County upon warrants drawn by the County Auditor upon the written order of the Judge of the Superior Court in said County.Ã¢ÂÂ
When the law expressly confers upon the judge or magistrate the power to order the claims paid, such judge or magistrate is then himself the auditor of the claim, and if the judge has authority to make such order the action of the judge, in the absence of fraud, is conclusive and stands in the same position as any other judicial judgment or order. (Woody v. Peairs, supra; White v. Mathews, supra.)
We are satisfied that the order which is the subject of dispute in this action was in the nature of a judicial order, and that it cannot be attacked in the manner in which plaintiff here seeks to attack it, unless some defect appears on its face which would show some character of invalidity. It is, therefore, necessary to carefully examine the language of section 928 to ascertain whether any such invalidity appears.
That portion of section 928 of the Penal Code with which we are here specially concerned reads as follows:
Ã¢ÂÂIt shall be the duty of the Grand Jury annually to make a ""careful and complete examination of the books, records and accounts of all the officers of the county, and of every city board of education within the county, and especially those pertaining to the revenue, and report as to the facts they have found, with such recommendations as they, may deem proper and fit; and if, in their judgment, the services of an expert are necessary, they shall have power to employ one, at an agreed compensation, to be first approved by the court; and if, in their judgment, the services of assistants to such expert are required, they shall have power to employ such, at a compensation to be agreed upon and approved by the court.
Ã¢ÂÂIt shall be the duty of every grand jury first impaneled in even numbered years to investigate and report upon the needs for increase or decrease in salaries of the county supervisors, the district attorney and the auditor, and it shall cause a copy of such report to be transmitted to each member of the Legislature representing the county in which it has been impaneled before the commencement of the regular *Supp. 893session of the Legislature in odd numbered years. It shall also be the duty of every grand jury to investigate and report upon the needs of all county officers in its county, including the abolition or creation of offices and the equipment for, or the method or system of performing the duties of, the several offices, and it shall cause a copy of such report to be transmitted to each member of the board of supervisors in its county.Ã¢ÂÂ (Emphasis added.)
Section 928 of the Penal Code is cast into five (5) paragraphs and it will be seen that the first paragraph relates solely to the examination of books, records and accounts. It will be further noted that this first paragraph is all in one sentence, and that the portion relating to the employment of an expert is a part of that sentence. By the doctrine of ejusdem generis, the portion providing power to employ an expert indubitably relates back to and receives its identifying generia from the subject with which the sentence is started.
It will be further noted that the thought content of paragraph two relates to the needs of county officers, including their equipment. This paragraph is complete in itself and contains no reference of any. kind to the employment of an expert.
An examination of the legislative history of grand juries in California compels a conclusion that the Legislature has regularly followed a practice of defining and delimiting the powers of the grand jury in relation to employment of others. (Allen v. Payne, 1 Cal.2d 607 at 608 [36 P.2d 614]; Woody v. Peairs, supra.)
We have examined the statutes of California carefully, and we have not found anything which we consider authority for the employment by the grand jury of an expert to examine and investigate the equipment needs of county officers.
In Allen v. Payne, 1 Cal.2d 607, 608 [36 P.2d 614] the court in holding that grand juries have no inherent or implied powers to contract services in connection with their investigation held Ã¢ÂÂThis conclusion is reinforced by an examination of the legislative history of the grand jury in this state, in the light of established rules of statutory construction. That examination reveals a practice of defining and delimiting its powers in relation to employment, by express statutory grant. ... It seems clear . . . that the legislature has considered the employment of persons by grand jury a matter to be governed by statute.Ã¢ÂÂ
A reading of section 928 of the Penal Code as here*Supp. 894inabove set out fails to show any authority whatever, for the grand jury to employ experts to examine and investigate Ã¢ÂÂthe equipment needs of certain offices of the County of Fresno. Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ
Whatever power the judge had to make the order in the case before us derives from said section 928. The power of the judge to make the order depended on the power of the grand jury to incur the expenses covered by it.
So far as the order authorizing an increase in the amount in excess of $10,000 was for services authorized by section 928 it is not subject to collateral attack, but as to the item of $749.91 for the examination and investigation of the equipment needs of certain offices of the County of Fresno it is void on its face as having been made without jurisdiction for the simple reason that there was no authority in section 928 for the grand jury to contract for these services.
The judgment appealed from is reversed and the cause remanded to the trial court for proceedings in accordance with the views expressed herein.

This is an appeal from a judgment awarding plaintiff-respondent damages in the sum of $1,553 and costs for loss sustained in the destruction by fire of certain personal property. The complaint alleges, and the trial court found, that the fire was proximately caused by the negligent maintenance on the part of defendant-appellant Southern California Edison Company of the electric power lines serving the property occupied by respondent as a dwelling house.
At the time of the fire, on March 7, 1953, and for some time prior to this date respondent and her children were the tenants of certain residential property in the city of Ontario. Electric service was provided to these premises by defendant-appellant through the medium of three service wires leading from the main line service pole to the house, and wires connected thereto leading to the garage. These wires were strung over the roof of the garage or warehouse located between the pole and the point where such wires were attached to respondentÃ¢ÂÂs house. The warehouse was an old wooden building and its roof covered by tar paper or asphalt which was in a state of deterioration due to the weather and the ravages of time. Respondent utilized this warehouse primarily for the storage of certain materials, equipment and tools incident to the conduct of her trade or business as an artist and textile processor. This personal property, stored in the warehouse, was destroyed by the fire and this action brought to recover damages for such loss.
It is the contention of respondent that the appellant failed to exercise proper care in the maintenance of these wires; that, as a result thereof, the insulation or weatherproofing on the wires was permitted to decay and deteriorate; that, during a windstorm on March 7, the wires rubbed together, sagged on the roof of the warehouse, and caused a *Supp. 896short circuit which ignited the roofing material, resulting in the fire which destroyed the building and its contents.
' Appellant contends that the fire started inside the building and did not originate on the roof. In support of this contention, appellant produced certain witnesses, including the fire chief and the assistant chief distribution engineer of the Southern California Edison Company. The latter two witnesses were permitted to give expert testimony and expressed their opinions as to the point of origin of the fire. The trial court found adversely to appellant and rejected its theory of the cause of the fire.
The sole contention advanced by appellant is that the evidence fails to support the judgment. No legal authority is cited to this court to indicate that appellant, as a public utilities company, is not obligated to maintain its service lines in a safe condition with due regard to their location and any hazard in connection therewith. We must assume, then, that such duty is imposed upon appellant under the circumstances disclosed by the testimony.  The trier of facts is not bound to accept the conclusions or opinions of any expert and, in this case, the trial court obviously gave little weight or credence thereto.
Under elementary principles of law, too well established to require citation of authority, the appellate court will construe the evidence and resolve every substantial conflict in support of the findings of the trial court. If there is competent evidence to support the findings and judgment, then this court will not substitute its evaluation or interpretation of the evidence in place of the ultimate facts as determined by the lower court.
The testimony of respondent herself supports a finding that the wires were Ã¢ÂÂworn,Ã¢ÂÂ lacking in insulation, and in contact with the roof. As a percipient witness, she observed the wires moving in the wind, saw the spark on top of the roof, and instantly noted the flash of fire on the roof. This evidence alone sufficiently sustains the findings and judgment of the lower court.
Judgment is affirmed.

The line of battle on this appeal is distinctly drawn. It touches section 24243 of the Health and Safety Code, which the defendant was charged with having violated, and which reads: Ã¢ÂÂA person shall not discharge from any source whatsoever such quantities of air contaminants or other material which cause injury, detriment, nuisance or annoyance to any considerable number of persons or to the public or which endanger the comfort, repose, health or safety of any such persons or the public or which cause or *882have a natural tendency to cause injury or damage to business or property.Ã¢ÂÂ But, argues the defendant on this appeal from the judgment that followed its conviction, that which section 24243 condemns is virtually that declared to be a public nuisance in these words in section 370 of the Penal Code: Ã¢ÂÂAnything which is injurious to health, or is indecent, or offensive to the senses, or an obstruction to the free use of property, so as to interfere with the comfortable enjoyment of life or property by an entire community or neighborhood, or by any considerable number of persons ... . Ã¢ÂÂ The fact that the section first quoted describes that which the second defines as a public nuisance is significant, defendantÃ¢ÂÂs argument continues, because by section 731a of the Code of Civil Procedure if one operates a plant in a commercial or manufacturing zone where expressly authorized, that which he does shall not be deemed a public nuisance unless there is proof of unnecessary or injurious methods of operation. As, admittedly, in the informal method of presenting the evidence, no such proof was made, the judgment, the defendant contends, should be reversed. Were we persuaded that section 731a of the Code of Civil Procedure has the effect contended for by the defendant, we would reverse the judgment, but we have concluded that it has no such effect for several reasons.
Section 731a of the Code of Civil Procedure reads as follows: Ã¢ÂÂWhenever any city, city and county, or county shall have established zones or districts under authority of law wherein certain manufacturing or commercial uses are expressly permitted, except in an action to abate a public nuisance brought in the name of the people of the State of California, no person or persons, firm or corporation shall be enjoined or restrained by the injunctive process from the reasonable and necessary operation in any such industrial or commercial zone of any use expressly permitted therein, nor shall such use be deemed a nuisance without evidence of the employment of unnecessary and injurious methods of operation. Nothing in this act shall be deemed to apply to the regulation and working hours of canneries, fertilizing plants, refineries and other similar establishments whose operation produce offensive odors.Ã¢ÂÂ
This section was added to the code in 1935, (Stats. 1935, p. 1584). The title of the act by which it was added reads: Ã¢ÂÂAn act to add Section 731a to the Code of Civil Procedure, relating to the use of the injunction in industrial or commercial zones. Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ Due to the limiting provisions of article IV, section 24, state Constitution, that Ã¢ÂÂEvery act shall *883embrace but one subject, which subject shall be expressed in its title. But if any subject shall be embraced in an act which shall not be expressed in its title, such act shall be void only as to so much thereof as shall not be expressed in its title,Ã¢ÂÂ if section 731a would otherwise be interpreted as giving a new definition of Ã¢ÂÂpublic nuisance,Ã¢ÂÂ it could not be given that effect because plainly the title of the act adding the section does not cover the matter. In the four cases relied upon by the defendant in support of its statement: Ã¢ÂÂ Section 731a of the Code of Civil Procedure has been upheld in a considerable number of cases,Ã¢ÂÂ injunctions were sought. So far as we are aware, no court has held in any other type of case that the section had changed the statutory law.
For another reason we are convinced that the defendant is not helped by section 731a of the Code of Civil Procedure. The ease made against the defendant was that many were offended by the nauseating odors that emanated from defendantÃ¢ÂÂs plant. As we read section 731a of the Code of Civil Procedure, by its concluding sentence it clearly declares that in such cases as this its limitations do not apply.
The judgment and order appealed from are affirmed.

The defendant, having pleaded guilty to 12 counts charging as many violations of section 212 of the Labor Code, was sentenced to a dozen terms in jail. He has appealed from the judgment and sentence, contending that section 212 is unconstitutional and that for various reasons, each count falls short of stating a public offense. We are persuaded that neither contention has any merit.
Section 212 reads:
Ã¢ÂÂNo person, or agent or officer thereof, shall issue in payment of wages due, or to become due, or as an advance on wages to be earned:
Ã¢ÂÂ (a) [Requisites: Sufficiency of funds for payment.] Any order, check, draft, note, memorandum, or other acknowledgment of indebtedness, unless it is negotiable and payable in cash, on demand, without discount, at some established place of business in the State, the name and address of which must appear on the instrument, and at the time of its issuance and for a reasonable time thereafter, which must be at least 30 *885days, the maker or drawer has sufficient funds in, or credit, arrangement, or understanding with the drawee for its payment.
Ã¢ÂÂ(b) [Instruments redeemable in merchandise.] Any script, coupon, cards, or other thing redeemable, in merchan-' dise or purporting to be payable or redeemable otherwise than in money.
Ã¢ÂÂ[Protest or dishonor.] Where an instrument mentioned in subdivision (a) is protested or dishonored, the notice or memorandum of protest or dishonor is admissible as proof of presentation, nonpayment and protest and is presumptive evidence of knowledge of insufficiency of funds or credit with the drawee.Ã¢ÂÂ
The several counts are identical save for the dates alleged and the names of the persons whose wages were involved, so, for our purposes, it is sufficient to have before us, as illustrative, the charging words of count I, which were that the defendant Ã¢ÂÂdid wilfully and unlawfully in the City of Los Angeles, issue to Humberto Munoz in payment of wages due and to become due, and as an advance on wages to be earned, an order, check, draft, note, memorandum and other acknowledgment of indebtedness which was not them and there negotiable and payable in cash on demand, without discount, at some established place of business in the State of California, and in which at the time of the issuance thereof, and for at least thirty (30) days thereafter, the maker and drawer thereof had sufficient funds or credit, arrangement or understanding with the drawee, for the payment thereof, and having on the said instrument the name and address of the established place of business whereat said order, cheek, draft, note, memorandum and other acknowledgment of indebtedness was payable.Ã¢ÂÂ
Hereafter, in this opinion, except where need for a more particular expression of thought is required, we shall use the word Ã¢ÂÂinstrumentÃ¢ÂÂ as a substitute for Ã¢ÂÂorder, check,Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ etc.
It is rather obvious that the Legislature did not use the word Ã¢ÂÂdraweeÃ¢ÂÂ in its technical sense, where it appears at the end of section 212 and before that near the close of subdivision (a). Plainly it is not correctly used with reference to the maker of a note, and unless the word is given a general and not a technical meaning, it does not serve the unmistakable purpose of the section, which is to require that any instrument used in the immediate place of money to pay wages, shall be readily converted into money at an established *886place of business, prepared to pay over the money on demand of the holder of the instrument.  It is fair to sum up the provisions of the section as forbidding a person to issue in payment of wages an instrument that is not (1) negotiable, (2) payable in cash, (3) on demand, (4) without discount, (5) at an established place of business in the State, (6) the name and address of which appears on the instrument, and (7) which place of business has been prepared, by the deposit of funds, the establishment of credit, or by some arrangement or understanding, to pay the money called for by the instrument.
If any one of the seven requirements is missing, the issuance of the instrument is in violation of the section, and a violation is, by virtue of section 215, of the Labor Code, a misdemeanor.  In charging a violation it would, of course, be fairer to a defendant not to use the shotgun method of pleading, but to point the particular or particulars in which it is claimed that the instrument fails to measure up to the requirements of the section. The complaint before us, we note, does not call attention to any particular shortcoming, but lists all seven of the requirements conjunctively, with the prefatory statement that the instrument issued did Ã¢ÂÂnot then and thereÃ¢ÂÂ meet the requirements. A defendant who pleads guilty to such a complaint, which states a public offense, without attacking it hy a demurrer, is in no position to complain that his precise offense is not pinpointed.
 The appealing defendant contends either that knowledge that he has not provided funds for the payment of the instrument is a requirement of the section, in which event the complaint is faulty because it contained no allegation that he had that knowledge, or the section is invalid because it, in effect, provides imprisonment for debt. The only basis for his first position is the presumption declared in the concluding paragraph of the section. We do not find in the declaration of the presumption any intention that the provisions of subdivision (a), respecting the sufficiency of funds at the established place of business, shall not be required unless the issuer of the instrument knew that sufficient funds were not on hand. Knowledge is not required by the wording of subdivision (a), and whatever the purpose of the presumption, its appearance in the concluding paragraph does not suffice to write it into the earlier passage, where it does not appear.
*887Nor do we entertain any doubt that even though knowledge of insufficient funds in the hands of the Ã¢ÂÂdraweeÃ¢ÂÂ is not required, the section is constitutional. It is to be noted that it does not purport to inflict punishment for failure to pay wages, but for undertaking to pay them by the issuance of some instrument. One who chooses to make use of an instrument instead of cash, may constitutionally be charged with first knowing that the instrument he issues conforms to the requirements of the code, and his ignorance of the fact that if funds are needed, they are insufficient, is not made an excuse by the section nor required by any constitutional principle.
We have considered defendantÃ¢ÂÂs further attacks upon the complaint and find none to be a valid ground for a reversal, and none to justify comment lengthening this opinion. The judgment and sentence [see People v. Tokich (1954), 128 Cal.App.2d 515, 519 [275 P.2d 816, 818] ; People v. Ramirez (1956), 143 Cal.App.2d 554, 555 [300 P.2d 106, 109]] are affirmed.

Defendant appeals from judgments of conviction on both counts of a complaint which contains the following charges: Count OneÃ¢ÂÂOn or about February 1, 1961, he carried on his profession of practice of the law in the City of Oakland without the license prescribed by section 5-1.02 of the Oakland Municipal Code thereby violating section 16240 of the California Business and Professions Code, a misdemeanor. Count TwoÃ¢ÂÂOn or about February 1, 1961, he practiced law in the City of Oakland without the license prescribed by section 5-1.02 of the Oakland Municipal Code thereby committing a misdemeanor under the penal provisions of said code. He admits that he practiced law at that time and place without obtaining such a license. The only issues raised are:
1. Do the penal provisions in the Oakland Business Licensing Law render it invalid ?
2. Do the convictions constitute double punishment for a single act on appellantÃ¢ÂÂs part?
Is the Oakland Business Licensing Law Valid ?
Appellant concedes that the City of Oakland may collect a tax from him for practicing law within the city and that a proper ordinance could be enacted to effect the raising of revenue by such means (In re Groves, 54 Cal.2d 154 [4 Cal.Rptr. 844, 351 P.2d 1028]). But he contends that the Oakland Business Licensing Law, purporting to be a revenue measure, is in fact a regulation of the practice of the law in that city.
The State of California has preempted the field of regulating and licensing persons entitled to practice law within the state (Bus. & Prof. Code, ÃÂ§ 6000 et seq.). Under such circumstances no city can impose restrictions upon persons duly licensed by the state, except to require them to pay a tax for the privilege of maintaining within the city a place in which, or from which, they practice their profession. Any other restriction would conflict with the general law of the state (Cal. Const., art. XI, ÃÂ§ 11; Franklin v. Peterson, 87 Cal.App.2d 727, 732 [197 P.2d 788]).
Municipal ordinances have been held invalid where qualifications or tests have been required, other than the possession *915of a license to carry on the business or profession duly issued by the state. (See Horwith v. City of Fresno, 74 Cal.App.2d 443 [168 P.2d 767]; City & County of San Francisco v. Boss, 83 Cal.App.2d 445 [189 P.2d 32]; Lynch v. City of Los Angeles, 114 Cal.App.2d 115 [249 P.2d 856]; Agnew v. City of Los Angeles, 51 Cal.2d 1 [330 P.2d 385]; Agnew v. Culver City, 147 Cal.App.2d 144 [304 P.2d 788].) Therefore, we must accept as settled law that to uphold the validity of the ordinance in question it must be found to be, in fact, a purely revenue measure.
The ordinance professes, on its face, to be a revenue measure. Section 5-1.04 provides: Ã¢ÂÂThe term Ã¢ÂÂlicenseÃ¢ÂÂ as used in this Article shall not be construed to mean a permit. The fees prescribed by this Article constitute a tax for revenue purposes, and are not regulatory permit fees.Ã¢ÂÂ
Section 5-1.02 referred to in both counts of the complaint provides: Ã¢ÂÂLicense Required.Ã¢ÂÂIt shall be unlawful for any person either for himself or for any other person, to commence or carry on any business in this Article specified, in the City of Oakland, without first having procured a license from said city so to do, or without complying with any and all regulations of such business contained in this Article; and the carrying on of any business without first having procured a license from said city so to do, or without complying with any and all regulations of this Article, shall constitute a separate violation of this Code for each and every day that such a business is so carried on.Ã¢ÂÂ No other provisions of the article therein referred to affects the practice of law except section 5-1.29, which specifies the amount of license fee to be paid by professional men doing business within the city.
Section 16240 of the Business and Professions Code provides: Ã¢ÂÂEngaging in business, etc., without license: Misdemeanor. Every person who commences or carries on any business, trade, profession, or calling, for the transaction or carrying on of which a license is required by any law of this State, without taking out or procuring the license prescribed by such law, is guilty of a misdemeanor.Ã¢ÂÂ
A city ordinance is a law of this state within the meaning of this section of the Business and Professions Code (formerly Pen. Code, ÃÂ§ 435). In re Sweetman, 5 Cal.App. 577 [90 P. 1069]; In re Johnson, 47 Cal.App. 465 [190 P. 852]. But obviously a conviction under this provision of the state law would fail if the city ordinance relied on was invalid.
*916Section 1-3.01 of the Oakland Municipal Code provides: Ã¢ÂÂViolations, A Misdemeanor. Any person violating any of the provisions or failing to comply with any of the regulatory requirements of this Code, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. Any person convicted of a misdemeanor under the provisions of this code shall be punishable by a fine of not more than $500.00 or by imprisonment in the City Prison for a period of not more than six months, or by both such fine and imprisonment. Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ
Appellant cites cases where local ordinances have been held to be invalid where municipalities have sought to punish under local law, acts which are punishable by state law. Analysis of these eases reveals that each was an attempt to invade a field which had been preempted by the general law of the state. In re Portnoy, 21 Cal.2d 237 [131 P.2d 1], involves an attempt by the County of Riverside to make possession of a slot machine a misdemeanor. Such was already declared by the state to be a misdemeanor under section 330a of the Penal Code. Pipoly v. Benson, 20 Cal.2d 366 [125 P.2d 482, 147 A.L.R. 515], involves an attempt by the City of Los Angeles to impose additional traffic regulations to control public roadways in conflict with the California Vehicle Code. This would invade a field fully preempted by the state. The Oakland ordinance has none of the objectionable features discussed in these cases.
Section 37100 of the Government Code empowers municipal bodies to Ã¢ÂÂpass ordinances not in conflict with the Constitution and laws of the State or the United States.Ã¢ÂÂ Section 37101 of that code empowers them to Ã¢ÂÂlicense, for revenue and regulation, and fix the license tax upon, every kind of lawful business transacted in the city, including shows, exhibitions, and games.Ã¢ÂÂ
In re Groves, 54 Cal.2d 154 [4 Cal.Rptr. 844, 351 P.2d 1028], at page 156, states: Ã¢ÂÂWhether or not state law has occupied the field of regulation, cities may tax business carried on within their boundaries and enforce such taxes by requiring business licenses for revenue and by criminal penalties.Ã¢ÂÂ (Emphasis added.)
It has been pointed out that the Palm Springs ordinance involved in the Groves case differs from the Oakland ordinance in that the former expressly provides that Ã¢ÂÂThe criminal penalties provided for by this Code shall not be applied to businesses or professions requiring a State license as a condition precedent to doing business in the City, nor, as a *917method of obtaining collection of the license fees.Ã¢ÂÂ The Oakland ordinance specifically makes doing business without a city license a misdemeanor and specifies the penalty.
Appellant contends that by this device he can be incarcerated for failure to pay the tax and thus prevented from practicing law although he is duly licensed to do so by the state. Claiming that this, in effect, is regulative he cited two eases. But they are readily distinguished from the case at bar. City of Sonora v. Curtin, 137 Cal. 583 [70 P. 674], declares that the cityÃ¢ÂÂs authority to license attorneys falls under its taxing power and not its police power; the ordinance in question provides that Ã¢ÂÂevery lawyer shall pay a licenseÃ¢ÂÂ; this is a tax upon the person because he is a lawyer, which makes it invalid. It is to be distinguished from a license tax upon the business of practicing law which would be valid. (In re Johnson, 47 Cal.App. 465, 469 [190 P. 852].) City of San Mateo v. Mullin, 59 Cal.App.2d 652 [139 P.2d 351], declares that a business license law that fixes the tax in an unreasonable or arbitrary manner or which inadequately defines the subject of the tax is vulnerable to attack; but it held the San Mateo business licensing law to be a valid revenue measure.
The Supreme Court, in the Groves case, indicated that the applicable law was set forth in the habeas corpus proceedings brought by an attorney jailed in Los Angeles for practicing law without paying that cityÃ¢ÂÂs business license tax.  In re Galusha, 184 Cal. 697, 699 [195 P. 406] :
Ã¢ÂÂAs in the case of other professions or businesses which can be taxed by the state, the cases hold that the state can delegate to a municipality the power to impose a tax for the privilege of following the practice of the profession within the jurisdiction of the municipality. [Citations.]  The imposition of an occupational tax by a municipality upon those engaged in the practice of the legal profession is not an interference with state affairs.  The mere compliance with certain prerequisites, in return for which a license to practice law is granted by the state, does not place a person beyond the range of additional regulation of the conditions upon which the license may be used.  The municipality, in imposing an occupational tax upon attorneys, is not interfering with state regulations, for it is not attempting to prescribe qualifications for attorneys different from or additional to those prescribed by the state. It is merely providing for an increase in its revenue by imposing a tax upon those who, by pursuing their profession within its limits, are *918deriving benefits from the advantages especially afforded by the city. The tax is levied upon the business of practicing law, rather than upon a person because he is an attorney at law. [Citation.]  A license to practice does not carry with it exemption from taxation.Ã¢ÂÂ
Concurrent with the decision in the Galusha case, the Supreme Court upheld a conviction under the penal provisions of the Los Angeles business license law in another case. (In re Nowak, 184 Cal. 701 [195 P. 402].)
In re Johnson, 47 Cal.App. 465 [190 P. 852], involved a situation similar to the case at bar. Johnson had been convicted under the Marysville business license law which contained penal provisions. The court held that it was immaterial whether or not the city had such power or attempted to assert such power because the ordinance was deemed to be a law of the state and could be enforced as a misdemeanor under section 435 of the Penal Code. This Penal Code section was later repealed and is now embodied in section 16240 of the Business and Professions Code.  To the same effect see In re Diehl, 8 Cal.App. 51 [96 P. 98], and Ex parte Heylman, 92 Cal. 492 [28 P. 675], where city ordinances imposing business taxes and providing penal provisions for enforcing them were held to be valid.
Therefore the Oakland Business Licensing Law as set forth in its Municipal Code is valid and supports the conviction of Appellant for violating section 16240 of the Business and Professions Code as charged in Count One.
Does Conviction and Sentence on Count Two Constitute Double Punishment?
The record reveals that the trial court found appellant 'guilty on both counts of the complaint and fined him $105 or 20 days in the county jail on each count, to be served concurrently. The only conduct of appellant referred to in either count was practicing law in Oakland on or about February 1, 1961, without the license required under that cityÃ¢ÂÂs business licensing law. Having been convicted and sentenced for violating section 16240 of the Business and Professions Code in Count One, is it not double punishment to convict and sentence the Appellant under the penal provisions of the Oakland Municipal Code for the same conduct in Count Two?
Section 654 of the Penal Code provides that a single act by aÃ¢ÂÂdefendant cannot be punished more than once.
Ã¢ÂÂPunishment for two offenses arising from the same act is prohibited by the constitutional and common-law rule *919against multiple punishment for necessarily included offenses [citations] and by Penal Code, section 654, which provides that Ã¢ÂÂan act or omission which is made punishable in different ways by different provisions of this code may be punishable under either of such provisions, but in no ease can it be punished under more than one.Ã¢ÂÂ . . . Whether a course of criminal conduct is divisible and therefore gives rise to more than one act within the meaning of section 654 depends on the intent and objective of the actor. If all the offenses were incident to one objective, the defendant may be punished for any one of such offenses but not for more than one.Ã¢ÂÂ (Neal v. State of California, 55 Cal.2d 11, 18, 19 [9 Cal.Rptr. 607, 357 P.2d 839].)
If appellant had been charged with violating the provisions of the business licensing law at some other time in Count Two, some justification for the second conviction might be found. But certainly the record here shows no such factual situation.
Section 654 of the Penal Code refers to Ã¢ÂÂ [a]n act or omission which is made punishable in different ways by different provisions of this code ...Ã¢ÂÂ (emphasis added). Neither charge here is based upon violations of the Penal Code. Count One is based on the Business and Professions Code. Count Two is based on the Oakland Municipal Code. However, the legal principal involved is one based upon fundamental justice and the common law (People v. Tideman, 57 Cal.2d 574 [21 Cal.Rptr. 207, 370 P.2d 1007]).  The legislative intent expressed in section 654 is to prevent double punishment whether the crime is defined in the Penal Code or any other law of the state that properly defines a crime.
Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂIf only a single act is charged as the basis of the multiple convictions, only one conviction can be affirmed, notwithstanding that the offenses are not necessarily included offenses. It is the singleness of the act and not of the offense that is determinative.Ã¢ÂÂ (People v. Knowles, 35 Cal.2d 175, 187 [217 P.2d 1].)  Therefore the conviction and sentence on Count Two constitutes double punishment for the same act on appellantÃ¢ÂÂs part and should not be permitted to stand.
The judgment and sentence in Count One is affirmed. The judgment and sentence in Count Two is reversed with directions that said count be dismissed.

FRIEDMAN, J.
Code section 647 is the new disorderly conduct law, enacted in 1961, to replace the obsolete and partially unconstitutional vagrancy law (see In re Newbern, 53 Cal.2d 786 [3 Cal.Rptr. 364, 350 P.2d 116]). It provides in part: Ã¢ÂÂEvery person who commits any of the following acts shall be guilty of disorderly conduct, a misdemeanor: .... (e) Who loiters or wanders upon the streets or from place to place without apparent reason or business and who refuses to identify himself and to account for his presence when requested by any peace officer so to do, if the surrounding circumstances are such as to indicate to a reasonable man that the public safety demands such identification. 1 Ã¢ÂÂ
Defendant was convicted of violating the quoted provision and appeals. Primarily he contends that the evidence is insufficient to support his conviction.  He also argues inadequacy of the complaint. The latter contention, made for the first time on appeal, comes too late. (Penal Code, ÃÂ§ 1003; People v. Barry, 153 Cal.App.2d 193 [314 P.2d 531].) While *858asserting statutory vagueness, he expressly foregoes any constitutional attack on the statute.
A settled statement has been filed, outlining the following facts: Defendant was arrested in an unincorporated residential area at approximately 8 :50 p. m. on February 10, 1962. Earlier in the evening a Mr. Bill Little had pursued a man down one of the neighborhood streets. The man wore a dark jacket. Another resident of the neighborhood, Mrs. Fanger, saw a stranger in her garage. He wore a dark jacket and dark trousers with tapered legs. Mrs. Fanger telephoned the sheriffÃ¢ÂÂs office, reporting a prowler. Deputy Sheriff Kohlmeyer responded to the call and checked the neighborhood. Five blocks distant from the Fanger residence he saw defendant walking. Defendant told the officer that he had been visiting a friend named Mike; that he did not lmow where Mike lived and could give no address; that he was going to work at a cafÃÂ© in North Sacramento where he was employed as a dish washer. Defendant produced a social security card. He admitted that he was a parolee. Mrs. Fanger could not identify him as the man she had seen in her garage. Two aspects of the facts seem particularly noteworthy to us. First, at the time of stopping defendant the officer had no information as to the appearance of the person seen in Mrs. FangerÃ¢ÂÂs garage. Secondly, the officer had no awareness of the incident described by Mr. Little.
DefendantÃ¢ÂÂs brother-in-law, W. M. Thomason, lives in the same general area. Mr. Thomason testified that the defendant. had been his dinner guest and had started to walk to work at the Emerald CafÃÂ©; that Middlebury Road, where defendant was apprehended, was on the best route to the cafÃÂ©; that he Thomason, had offered to drive defendant to the cafÃÂ©, but the latter had decided to walk; that defendant cannot read. DefendantÃ¢ÂÂs sister, Mrs. Thomason, gave somewhat similar testimony. She stated that defendant was wearing a dark gray tweed sport coat and dark blue Ã¢ÂÂleviÃ¢ÂÂsÃ¢ÂÂ with tapered legs. Defendant testified that he had had dinner with his sister and her family; that he decided to walk to his employment from his sisterÃ¢ÂÂs home as he had on previous occasions; that he had not Ã¢ÂÂprowled.Ã¢ÂÂ He described his proposed route from the Thomason home to the Emerald CafÃÂ©, which route included the street on which Officer Kohlmeyer had stopped him. He also testified that he had a friend named Mike in North Sacramento ; that he did not know MikeÃ¢ÂÂs address or last name.
The night manager of the Emerald CafÃÂ© testified that *859defendant had been employed there for six months; that he was steady and faithful; that defendantÃ¢ÂÂs shift started at 10 p. m., but he usually appeared before 9 oÃ¢ÂÂclock. Defendant was due at work on the night of his arrest.
To produce a conviction under Penal Code section 647, subdivision (e) the prosecution must prove: (a) that the accused was loitering or wandering without apparent reason or business; (b) that, although requested by an officer, he refused to identify himself and account for his presence, and (c) that public safety considerations reasonably indicated a necessity for the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs identification.
Antiloitering statutes have been the source of much legislative and judicial difficulty (see In re Cregler, 56 Cal.2d 308 [14 Cal.Rptr. 289, 363 P.2d 305] ; Phillips v. Municipal Court, 24 Cal.App.2d 453 [75 P.2d 548] ; cf. Thompson v. City of Louisville, 362 U.S. 199 [80 S.Ct. 624, 4 L.Ed.2d 654, 80 A.L.R.2d 1355]). They represent an arena for conflict between healthy antipathy to the Ã¢ÂÂroustÃ¢ÂÂ or arrest on suspicion, on the one hand, and legitimate interests in crime prevention, on the other.  Security against arbitrary police intrusion is basic to a free society (Wolf v. Colorado, 338 U.S. 25, 27 [69 S.Ct. 1359, 93 L.Ed. 1782]). Thus, arrests on mere suspicion offend our constitutional notions. Frequently they amount to arrest for status or condition instead of unlawful conduct. Most of the provisions of the now-repealed vagrancy statute (former Pen. Code, ÃÂ§ 647) were concerned with status rather than conduct.
At the opposite side of the scale is the view that law enforcement officers need not wring their hands in constitutional frustration while nighttime prowlers and potential thieves and rapists skulk through our neighborhoods.  The usual accommodation between these warring notions is the concept of Ã¢ÂÂreasonable cause,Ã¢ÂÂ that is, an officer may properly inquire, search and sometimes arrest if he has reasonable cause to believe that a crime has been committed (People v. Simon, 45 Cal.2d 645 [290 P.2d 531]; People v. West, 144 Cal.App.2d 214 [300 P.2d 729]).
Section 647, subdivision (e) is itself the product of such a reconciliation. In its original form it was drafted by Professor Arthur Sherry of the University of California School of Law. (See, Sherry, Vagrants, Rogues and VagabondsÃ¢ÂÂOld Concepts in Need of Revision, 48 Cal.L.Rev. 557 (Oct. 1960).) As published by Professor Sherry, the draft read as follows: Ã¢ÂÂWho loiters or wanders upon the streets or from place to *860place without apparent reason or business and who refuses to identify himself and to account for his presence when requested by any peace officer so to do.Ã¢ÂÂ The Ã¢ÂÂreasonable manÃ¢ÂÂ clause which appears in the present statute was added to the Sherry draft by the Assembly Interim Committee on Criminal Procedure. (Assembly Interim Committee Reports, 1959-61, Vol. 22, No. 1, pages 14-18.) It was literally extracted from a dictum in Gisske v. Sanders, 9 Cal.App. 13, 16 [98 P. 43], which had been confirmed by the State Supreme Court in People v. Simon, 45 Cal.2d 645 [290 P.2d 531] : Ã¢ÂÂA police officer has a right to make inquiry in a proper manner of anyone upon the public streets at a late hour as to his identity and the occasion of his presence, if the surroundings are such as to indicate to a reasonable man that the public safety demands such identification.Ã¢ÂÂ
The Assembly committeeÃ¢ÂÂs draft was embodied in a bill which was subsequently enacted as Penal Code section 647. In effect, the statute as now drawn attempts to extend the power of inquiry and arrest to peace officers when demanded by reasonable considerations of public safety, while preventing the abuses inherent in arbitrary or dictatorial police interference. A statute which embodies these complex notions is difficult to draft and difficult to apply.
We consider whether the conduct of the defendant Bruno falls within the loitering or wandering clause of the statute. When accosted by the officer, Bruno was walking along a residential street in the early night hours. His counsel contends that Bruno was neither loitering nor wandering, but was walking to work, or, in statutory terms, that he had apparent reason for being on the street. The contention assumes acceptance of the defense testimony. BrunoÃ¢ÂÂs conviction by the trial court necessarily implies rejection of that testimony.  We must assume in favor of the conviction the existence of every fact which the trial court could have reasonably deduced from the evidence. (People v. Newland, 15 Cal.2d 678, 681 [104 P.2d 778].)  The test on appeal is whether there is substantial evidence to support the conclusion of the trier of fact. (People v. Daugherty, 40 Cal.2d 876, 885 [256 P.2d 911].)
In daily parlance Ã¢ÂÂwanderingÃ¢ÂÂ has a fairly innocent connotation. Here it appears in a criminal statute and is endowed with a somewhat more unpleasant color, indicative of one whose movements are coupled with criminal aims.  It has been held that Ã¢ÂÂloiteringÃ¢ÂÂ as used in a criminal statute *861has a sinister connotation, which includes waiting, but excludes the notion of waiting for a lawful purpose. (In re Cregler, supra, 56 Cal.2d 308, 312.) Similarly here, if prohibited loitering consists of waiting for evil purposes, so prohibited wandering consists of movement for evil purposes.  Three aspects of the testimony seem noteworthy at this point: First, defendant does not deny having told the officer he had been visiting Ã¢ÂÂMike,Ã¢ÂÂ although he now testifies, consistently with his sister and brother-in-law, that he had been at the latters Ã¢ÂÂ home for dinner. Second, defendant has never identified Mike or supplied MikeÃ¢ÂÂs address, other than by designating the general area of North Sacramento. Third, the location at which Deputy Kohlmeyer stopped defendant is on a possible, fairly direct route to defendantÃ¢ÂÂs place of employment. His proposed route, as actually described by him, is quite circuitous.
In view of the inconsistencies and contradictions which characterize defendantÃ¢ÂÂs statements to the officer and his testimony in court, there was substantial evidence to sustain the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs finding that his presence in the neighborhood constituted conduct within the meaning of the first clause of the statute.
Next we inquire whether there is substantial evidence of noncompliance with the second part of the statute, the requirement of identification and explanation. The defendant did show the officer his Social Security card. He did not, however, account for his presence other than to say that he had been visiting a friend whose last name and whereabouts he did not know. Such an obviously false account is no account at all. There is no basis for disturbing the implied finding of defendantÃ¢ÂÂs failure to account to the officer for his presence.
Lastly, we reach the third element of the statute, that is, whether the trial court was justified in finding that Ã¢ÂÂthe surrounding circumstances [were] such as to indicate to a reasonable man that the public safety demands such identification. Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ
In gauging the propriety of the officerÃ¢ÂÂs inquiry, the trier of fact cannot catalog Ã¢ÂÂsurrounding circumstancesÃ¢ÂÂ in the abstract. For statutory purposes, the surrounding circumstances are a relative quantity. They must be measured in relationship to time and state of mind. They must exist as of the time of arrest and cannot be assembled later as artificial justification for an arrest which was causeless when made. Further, they exist only with reference to the knowl*862edge, or state of mind, of one of the parties. But which party ?
The validity of an inquiry, search or arrest frequently turns on the officerÃ¢ÂÂs state of mind, that is, whether under the facts he had reasonable cause to believe that a crime had been committed or to suspect the defendant of a crime. (People v. Simon, supra, 45 Cal.2d 645, 650; People v. Harris, 146 Cal. App.2d 142, 145-146 [304 P.2d 178] ; People v. West, 144 Cal. App.2d 214, 218-219 [300 P.2d 729].)
Justice BrandÃÂ©is has said that the most valued right of civilized men is the right, as against the government, to be let alone (Olmstead v. United States, 277 U.S. 438, 478 [48 S.Ct. 564, 72 L.Ed. 944, 66 A.L.R. 376], dissent). But this right, like others, varies in inverse ratio to social necessity. At one end of the spectrum is the innocent citizen, faced with unjustified police action. At the other end is the criminal whose felonious act has been witnessed by a hotly pursuing policeman. The former has a complete right to be let alone; the latter has none. In the center of the spectrum are the various shadings of circumstance where investigating officers encounter their subjects in varying degrees of suspicion, on the one side, and constitutional immunity, on the other.
Arguably, the accosted citizen and not the officer is the Ã¢ÂÂreasonable manÃ¢ÂÂ meant by the statute. The innocent householder, strolling in the evening air, may insist on privacy, refusing to reveal his identity and business to an officer in hot pursuit of a fugitive. If ignorance can baffle inquiry, the legitimate objectives of law enforcement are frustrated. The statute was drawn in the light of court decisions dealing with Ã¢ÂÂreasonable causeÃ¢ÂÂ on the part of the officer. It was designed to prevent arbitrary, that is, causeless police action.
In short, propriety of the police inquiry turns on the knowledge of the officer. His information, none other, must meet the reasonable man standard. Facts outside his ken, however incriminating, cannot justify inquiry and arrest.
A search may not be justified by what it produces. (People v. Brown, 45 Cal.2d 640, 643 [290 P.2d 528].) Some of the suspicious circumstances produced hereÃ¢ÂÂthe tapered trousers, the probable falsehood regarding Ã¢ÂÂMike,Ã¢ÂÂ the running man described by Mr. Little, defendantÃ¢ÂÂs status as a paroleeÃ¢ÂÂwere unknown to the officer when he accosted defendant. These circumstances may not be used in retroactive support of a finding of reasonable cause.
The officer, however, had received a report of a male prowler. Although the hour was not late, it was dark.
*863He saw an isolated male pedestrian walking along the street in a suburban residential neighborhood at a point five blocks away from a reported prowling incident. It was the officerÃ¢ÂÂs duty to investigate the prowling complaint and to provide such protection to the community as was possible under the circumstances. He did not instigate a roadblock or a general roundup of unsuspecting citizenry. He did not indulge in indiscriminate stoppage of pedestrians brought outdoors by the presence of business establishments or public transportation facilities. The situation permitted a selective inquiry of a single pedestrian who might be or have knowledge of the prowler. We cannot label inquiry under these circumstances as arbitrary or offensive. Rather, the inquiry was in the area of reasonable public safety requirements.  The circumstances are strongly reminiscent of the Supreme CourtÃ¢ÂÂs statement in People v. Simon, supra, 45 Cal.2d 645, 650: Ã¢ÂÂThere is, of course, nothing unreasonable in an officerÃ¢ÂÂs questioning persons outdoors at night . . . and it is possible that in some circumstances even a refusal to answer would, in the light of other evidence, justify an arrest.Ã¢ÂÂ There was substantial evidence to sustain the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs finding under the third phase of the statute.
We have indulged in this tripartite and somewhat artificial dissection of the ease for the sake of clarity and because the statute has not yet been construed in any reported decision. We have also attempted to satisfy ourselves that we should not, on our own motion, engage in constitutional inquiries. Arguably the statute is an antiloitering law which permits arrests on suspicion alone.  Yet, it erects a built-in buffer against arbitrary police action. The ban against loitering and wandering cannot be isolated from the companion requirement of circumstances reasonably involving public safety. The statutory demand upon the private citizen for identification and explanation arises only in the context of the same circumstances. When the three parts of the statute are put together they present no patent constitutional objections and indeed seem to be consistent with doctrines stated in People v. Simon, supra, and similar cases. Under the circumstances, we see no reason to disturb the judgment on constitutional grounds.
Judgment affirmed.

SHABO, J.
The People appeal from an order of the trial court dismissing the charge of violating Vehicle Code section 23102, subdivision (a) (driving *Supp. 4under the influence of alcohol) and adding a charge of violating Vehicle Code section 23103 (reckless driving) as well as from the judgment based on that order. They contend that the court improperly amended the complaint, over the PeopleÃ¢ÂÂs objection, to allow defendant to plead nolo contendere to a lesser crime than the one with which he was originally charged. We agree and reverse the order and judgment. We also explain why we denied respondentÃ¢ÂÂs motion to dismiss the appeal.
The record reveals that on September 24, 1981, a complaint was filed against defendant in Rio Hondo Municipal Court charging him with one count of violating former section 23102, subdivision (a) (driving under the influence of alcohol) of the Vehicle Code. On March 25, 1982, defendant appeared in court with counsel and the following took place:
Ã¢ÂÂThe Court: On the trial calendar, Luis Hernandez.
Ã¢ÂÂMr. Rios: Ready for trial.
Ã¢ÂÂThe Court: Will your client plead to reckless driving?
Ã¢ÂÂMr. Rios: Yes.
Ã¢ÂÂThe Court: Mr. Hernandez, I am willing on the courtÃ¢ÂÂs own motion to reduce this offense to reckless driving only because you have no prior record and only because the damage has been paid in this accident in this case. I am doing this over the objection of the People. I donÃ¢ÂÂt normally do that, but in this case I feel that you have a lot of things going for you. That does not excuse your conduct on this particular date.
Ã¢ÂÂAlso, if the court calendar was not so crowded I would not be so inclined to do that.Ã¢ÂÂ
The deputy district attorney prosecuting the matter objected to the proposed disposition on the ground that the court was appropriating the role of the prosecuting agency by determining the nature of the charge to be filed and was thus violating the doctrine of separation of powers. The court proceeded to amend the complaint by interlineation, adding the reckless driving charge.1 Defendant pleaded no contest to the charge of reckless driving and was placed on probation on stated terms and conditions.
*Supp. 5Discussion
i . The Delay in the Appellate Process Did Not Justify Dismissal of the Appeal.
Relying primarily upon People v. Kerwin (1972) 23 Cal.App.3d 466 [100 Cal.Rptr. 240] and our decisions in People v. Ruhl (1976) 63 Cal.App.3d Supp. 6 [134 Cal.Rptr. 62] and People v. Bighinatti (1975) 55 Cal.App.3d Supp. 5 [127 Cal.Rptr. 310], respondent moved this court to dismiss the instant appeal. Respondent contended that his right to due process of law and to a speedy trial had been abridged by reason of a 14-month delay in processing the instant appeal.2 By a separate order we denied his motion. At his request, made on petition for rehearing, we now explain our reasons for doing so.
Although irregularities resulting in delay in the appellate process may, when meaningful appellate review is precluded thereby, constitute a violation of due process of law (see People v. Sylvia (1960) 54 Cal.2d 115, 125 [4 Cal.Rptr. 509, 351 P.2d 781]; People v. Ruhl, supra, 63 Cal.App.3d Supp. at p. 8), a defendant on appeal is not entitled to a reversal of the judgment of conviction by reason of the delay if the defendant secures an adequate hearing of the appeal. (People v. Sylvia, supra.) In the case at bench, the delay in the appellate process of which respondent complains has not defeated his right to an adequate hearing on appeal; thus, respondent has not established that the delay in any way prejudiced him on appellate review.  Indeed he states: Ã¢ÂÂIt is not respondentÃ¢ÂÂs position before this court that the delay in this case has prevented adequate review on appeal. It is rather respondentÃ¢ÂÂs position that the inordinate and unjustified delay in this case has violated his statutory and constitutional right to a speedy trial. Ã¢ÂÂ (Italics in original.) In essence respondent argues that the delay in the appellate process will result in respondentÃ¢ÂÂs excessively delayed trial, thereby depriving him of his Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial as well as his statutory right under Penal Code section 1382.
Because of respondentÃ¢ÂÂs posture in reference to his motion to dismiss, we need not decide whether the right to a speedy appeal emanates from the right to a speedy trial or from the constitutional guarantee of due process of law. We observe, however, that the vast majority of courts generally have rejected speedy trial as the constitutional basis for the right to a speedy appeal; instead they have recognized due process as the rightÃ¢ÂÂs foundationÃ¢ÂÂ at least in postjudgment appeals by the defendant. (See, e.g., People v. *Supp. 6Sylvia, supra, 54 Cal.2d 115; Commonwealth v. Pounds (1980) 490 Pa. 621 [417 A.2d 597]; Cunningham v. State (Tex.Crim.App. 1972) 484 S.W.2d 906; Zanders v.

In assessing the constitutional claim on due process grounds some courts have applied the factors set forth in Barker v. Wingo (1972) 407 U.S. 514, 530 [33 L.Ed.2d 101, 116-117, 92 S.Ct. 2182]; (see, e.g., State v. Files (1981) 183 Conn. 586 [441 A.2d 27, 27 A.L.R.4th 208]; Petition of Williams, supra, 393 N.E.2d at p. 355; Doescher v. Estelle, supra, 454 F.Supp. at p. 947; State v. Crabtree, supra, 625 S.W.2d at p. 674; Rheuark v. Shaw (5th Cir. 1980) 628 F.2d 297, 303; but see United States v. Alston, supra, 412 A.2d at pp. 357-359); an apparent minority of courts have focused essentially on the length of unjustified delay (Guam v. Olsen, supra, 462 F.Supp. 608; see, also, People v. Kerwin, supra, 23 Cal.App.3d 466; cf. State v. Files, supra, 441 A.2d 27). A majority of other jurisdictions, including California, seem to balance the factors of prejudice against justification for the delay. (See, e.g., People v. Sylvia, supra, 54 Cal.2d 115; People v. Missouri (1980) 100 Mich.App. 310 [299 N.W.2d 346, 352-353]; State v. Lagerquist, supra, 176 S.E.2d at p. 143; Gajdos v. State, supra, 462 N.E.2d at p. 1023; United States v. Alston, supra, 412 A.2d 351; State v. Chappie, supra, 660 P.2d at pp. 1225-1226; Dozie v. Cady, supra, 430 F.2d at p. 638; see, also, Commonwealth v. Swenson, supra, 331 N.E.2d at p. 901; Codispoti v. Howard, supra, 589 F.2d at p. 142); these courts *Supp. 7generally have considered prejudice in terms of the delayÃ¢ÂÂs impact upon the effectiveness and adequacy of appellate review (see, e.g., People v. Sylvia, supra, 54 Cal.2d 115; Commonwealth v. Dominico, supra, 306 N.E.2d at p. 855; Way v. Crouse, supra, 421 F.2d at p. 147), and have determined that the remedy for undue delay is review itself. (See, e.g., People v. Sylvia, supra; People v. Missouri, supra, 299 N.W.2d at p. 353; Commonwealth v. Dominico, supra, 306 N.E.2d at p. 855; see, also, State v. Crabtree, supra, 625 S.W.2d at p. 675; Layne v. Gunter, supra, 559 F.2d at p. 852; Reese v. State, supra, 481 S.W.2d at p. 843; Way v. Crouse, supra, 421 F.2d at p. 147.)
Because of respondentÃ¢ÂÂs contention and the procedural posture of the case as a PeopleÃ¢ÂÂs appeal, whose successful outcome will result in a probable future trial of respondent, an analysis grounded upon the right to a speedy trial is compelled.3 (See People v. Kerwin, supra, 23 Cal.App.3d 466; State v. Files, supra, 441 A.2d 27; Note, The Sixth Amendment Speedy Trial Guarantee: Delay Resulting From Interlocutory Appeals (1980) 60 B.U.L.Rev. 664.)  In California, the resolution of a constitutionally based claim of denial of a speedy trial requires that the court weigh the justification for delay against a showing of actual prejudice. (Scherling v. Superior Court (1978) 22 Cal.3d 493, 505 [149 Cal.Rptr. 597, 585 P.2d 219]; People v. Bradford (1976) 17 Cal.3d 8, 18-19 [130 Cal.Rptr. 129, 549 P.2d 1225]; Jones v. Superior Court (1970) 3 Cal.3d 734, 740 [91 Cal.Rptr. 578, 478 P.2d 10]; Overby v. Municipal Court (1981) 121 Cal.App.3d 377, 383, 385-387 [175 Cal.Rptr. 352].)  In this connection, it has been suggested by the author of the Boston University Law Review note that delay weighs against the prosecution; however, the author emphasizes that in determining the final weight to be attributed to this factor a court should look to the following four criteria: (1) the significance of the issue on appeal to maintaining the prosecution of the accused, i.e., could the prosecution proceed without an appeal of the adverse ruling? (See United States v. Herman, supra, 576 F.2d 1139, 1146-1147; cf. State v. Jenkins (1977) 29 Ore.App. 751 [565 P.2d 758, 761]); (2) the strength of the prosecutionÃ¢ÂÂs position in reference to the issue appealed; (see State v. Fernald (Me. 1979) 397 A.2d 194, 196; United States v. Herman, supra, *Supp. 8576 F.2d at p. 1146); (3) the dispatch with which the prosecution has pursued its appeal (see Day v. United States, supra, 390 A.2d 957, 967-968; United States v. Perry (D.D.C. 1973) 353 F.Supp. 1235, 1238); and (4) the seriousness of the offense charged. (United States v. Herman, supra, 576 F.2d at pp. 1146, 1147.) (See, also, Note, supra, at pp. 679-683.)
Applying the foregoing factors we conclude that the issue raised by the prosecution on this appeal was most significant, i.e., the power of a court to usurp the prosecutionÃ¢ÂÂs charging function and to dispose of the case by reaching a plea agreement with the accused over the PeopleÃ¢ÂÂs objection. (See People v. Orin (1975) 13 Cal.3d 937 [120 Cal.Rptr. 65, 533 P.2d 193].) Without appellate intervention the originally charged offense could not be tried by virtue of the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs unauthorized action. (See People v. Orin, supra, at p. 943.) Moreover, the prosecution engaged in no inordinate avoidable delay in prosecuting their appeal.4 Furthermore, the PeopleÃ¢ÂÂs position on appeal was unquestionably strong. Finally, the charged violation of former section 23102, subdivision (a) (now ÃÂ§ 23152, subd. (a)) of the Vehicle Code is among the most serious of misdemeanor offenses. Even weighing against the prosecution the 14-month delay on appeal from the time of filing the PeopleÃ¢ÂÂs notice of appeal, the foregoing circumstances did not warrant granting respondentÃ¢ÂÂs motion to dismiss. Indeed, as previously noted, respondent concedes that he has not been denied adequate appellate review.
None of the cases on which respondent relies requires a contrary determination. People v. Kerwin, supra, 23 Cal.App.3d 466, involved a PeopleÃ¢ÂÂs appeal of an order setting aside an information under Penal Code section 995 where, due to clerical error, the relevant period of unjustified delay in the appellate process exceeded by 30 days the 60-day time limit of section 1382, subdivision 2, which the Court of Appeal held was analogous, albeit imperfectly, to the constitutionally permissible period of delay under the state ConstitutionÃ¢ÂÂs right to a speedy trial. The defendant in Kerwin was unaware of the pendency of the PeopleÃ¢ÂÂs appeal. Unlike Kerwin the case at bench is not one in which the defendant was unaware of the pendency of the appeal.  Most significantly, however, the People in Kerwin conceded Ã¢ÂÂthat in the ordinary case a deprivation of a constitutional right to a speedy trial aborts the prosecution, whether or not prejudice is shown once it is established that there has been unreasonable delay.Ã¢ÂÂ That concession, based upon then prevailing law as set forth in Harris v. Municipal Court (1930) 209 Cal. 55, 64 [285 P. 699], and Rost v. Municipal Court (1960) 184 Cal.App.2d 507, 511 [7 Cal.Rptr. 869, 85 A.L.R.2d 974], no longer *Supp. 9represents the law in California. (Scherling v. Superior Court, supra, 22 Cal.3d 493, 505; Overby v. Municipal Court, supra, 121 Cal.App.3d 377, 383-387.) Moreover, the statutory period set forth in section 1382, although supplementary to a construction of the constitutional speedy trial provision, does not Ã¢ÂÂcarry the force or weight of constitutionally mandated imperatives.Ã¢ÂÂ (Townsend v. Superior Court (1975) 15 Cal.3d 774, 781 [126 Cal.Rptr. 251, 543 P.2d 619].)
Respondent misconstrues the holdings in People v. Bighinatti, supra, 55 Cal.App.3d Supp.5 and People v. Ruhl, supra, 63 Cal.App.3d Supp. 6, both of which involved inordinate delays in the appeals of minor traffic infractions. We ordered the appeals dismissed in the interests of justice. As we explained in Ruhl, the relatively minor traffic infraction did not justify the additional hardship on the accused which retrial would entail (63 Cal.App.3d Supp. at pp. 8-9.) We therefore exercised our discretionary power to dismiss the appeal. However, neither Bighinatti nor Ruhl support the proposition that inordinate and excessive delay in the appellate process alone requires dismissal of an appeal. (Cf. People v. Snowdy (1965) 237 Cal.App.2d 677, 683-684 [47 Cal.Rptr. 83].)
Having explained our reasons for denying respondentÃ¢ÂÂs motion, we now set forth our views of the responsibilities of the parties to an appeal and of the trial court in the hope of avoiding future needless delays in the appellate process.
The duty imposed upon the trial judge in settling the statement on appeal as expeditiously as possible is mandatory under rule 187 of the California Rules of Court. (People v. Bighinatti, supra, 55 Cal.App.3d Supp. 5, 7; see, also, People v. Ruhl, supra, 63 Cal.App.3d Supp. 6; People v. Jenkins (1976) 55 Cal.App.3d Supp. 55, 63-64 [127 Cal.Rptr. 870].) In Jenkins, supra, we noted that the trial judge, pursuant to rule 187, shall act expeditiously in setting a hearing to settle the statement on appeal or to certify the reporterÃ¢ÂÂs transcript. The judgeÃ¢ÂÂs duty is of course triggered by the timely service and filing of a proposed statement on appeal.  Under rule 184(d), an appellant has 15 days after the filing of notice of appeal to serve on the respondent and file with the trial court a proposed statement on appeal. If in such proposed statement appellant gives notice that the reporterÃ¢ÂÂs transcript is to be filed and made a part thereof, appellant may file within 15 days after the filing of the proposed statement a transcript of the evidence or other proceedings, and shall within five (5) days after such filing notify the respondent. An appellantÃ¢ÂÂs failure to comply with these time deadlines results in a default and dismissal of the appeal.
Under rule 185 respondent may within 15 days after such statement is filed, or notice is given of the filing of a reporterÃ¢ÂÂs transcript, serve on *Supp. 10appellant and file proposed amendments to the statement or transcript, or both.
The trial judge under rule 187 shall Ã¢ÂÂforthwithÃ¢ÂÂ fix a time for a hearing settling the statement or transcript, or both, Ã¢ÂÂwhich time shall be as early as the business of the court will permit . . the trial judge shall Ã¢ÂÂat the time fixed . . . settle the statement or transcript, or both, and the amendments proposed thereto, if any . . . .Ã¢ÂÂ
Although, unfortunately, the Rules of Court are silent on this point, we suggest that upon receipt of the proposed statement on appeal, the trial judge immediately set a hearing to settle the record on appeal and that the settlement hearing occur within 10 days of the filing of respondentÃ¢ÂÂs amendments to the proposed statement or transcript.
Moreover, the municipal court has the obligation to ensure that the record on appeal, once settled, is transmitted forthwith to the clerk of this court (rule 183(b)). In view of the delays in expeditiously processing appellate matters at the municipal court level, as exemplified by this case, we urge the municipal courts to undertake efforts at once to ensure adherence to the Rules of Court in preparing and transmitting the record on appeal. (See Christian, Delay in Criminal Appeals: A Functional Analysis of One CourtÃ¢ÂÂs Work (1971) 23 Stan.L.Rev. 676, 678-686.)
The municipal courtÃ¢ÂÂs observance of these time guidelines is indispensable to protecting the right of the parties to a speedy and effective appeal and to the efficient administration of the courtÃ¢ÂÂs business.
We hasten to add that the responsibility of the municipal court is a shared one: we have previously held the prosecution to the duty of monitoring cases in which a notice of appeal has been filed, and to petition the municipal court, if necessary, to obtain expeditious settlement of the record on appeal. (People v. Jenkins, supra, 55 Cal.App.3d Supp. 55, 67-68; see, also, People v. Ruhl, supra, 63 Cal.App.3d Supp. 6, 8.) We again emphasize the duty of the prosecution Ã¢ÂÂto insist upon an early hearing for the settlement of statements on appeal to avoid the dismissal of an otherwise flawless prosecution because of unnecessary procedural delaysÃ¢ÂÂ (People v. Ruhl, supra), and, following settlement of the statement on appeal, actively to insist that the municipal court Ã¢ÂÂforthwith transmit the record on appeal . . . to the clerk of [this] court.Ã¢ÂÂ (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 183(b).) Our emphasis upon the prosecutionÃ¢ÂÂs responsibility in this regard does not derogate from the corresponding responsibility of defense counsel on criminal appeals to insist upon timely preparation and transmission of the record on appeal. (See Christian, supra, at pp. 685-686.)
*Supp. 112. The Trial Court Erroneously Entered Into a Plea Bargain With Respondent.
The People contend on appeal that the trial court erred by engineering a plea bargain on its own motion and over the prosecutionÃ¢ÂÂs objection. We agree. The same issue was before the Court of Appeal in People v. Woodard (1982) 131 Cal.App.3d 107 [182 Cal.Rptr. 254]. In that case, the defendant was allowed to plead guilty to a burglary charge and a charge of child molestation was dismissed. The People had at first approved the arrangement but later, before the bargain was consummated, voiced their opposition. The Court of Appeal reversed, holding as follows: Ã¢ÂÂIt is well settled that a plea bargain is a tripartite agreement which requires the consent of the defendant, the People, and the court. (Pen. Code, ÃÂ§ 1192.5; People v. Orin (1975) 13 Cal.3d 937 [120 Cal.Rptr. 65, 533 P.2d 193].) The court has no authority to impose a bargain over the PeopleÃ¢ÂÂs objection nor to substitute itself as the representative of the People in the bargaining process. (People v. Anderson (1982) 129 Cal.App.3d 491 [181 Cal.Rptr. 68]; People v. Barnett (1980) 113 Cal.App.3d 563 [170 Cal.Rptr. 255].)Ã¢ÂÂ (Id., at p. 110.)
On the basis of the foregoing authority we hold that the trial court lacked authority, over the PeopleÃ¢ÂÂs objection, to add the count of violating Vehicle Code section 23103 and to permit the respondent to plead no contest thereto in lieu of the oifense which the prosecution had charged.
The order adding the charge of violating Vehicle Code section 23103 is reversed and the judgment based thereon is vacated. The matter is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
Reese, P. J., and Bernstein, J., concurred.

Page one of the docket sheet erroneously shows that the motion to amend the complaint was made by the People. The trial court later corrected this clerical error as reflected in the reporterÃ¢ÂÂs transcript.


The fault for the inordinate delay apparently lay with the municipal court for failing to settle the record on appeal and then in not properly transmitting it to our court.


Courts have held that the prosecutionÃ¢ÂÂs seeking of interlocutory review of an adverse order generally constitutes a valid reason justifying appropriate delay of trial. (See, e.g., Marcotte v. Municipal Court (1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 235, 240-243 [134 Cal.Rptr. 314]; People v. Superior Court (Mahle) (1970) 3 Cal.App.3d 476, 487-488 [83 Cal.Rptr. 771]; United States v. Herman (5th Cir. 1978) 576 F.2d 1139, 1146; United States v. Jackson (7th Cir. 1975) 508 F.2d 1001, 1005; cf. Day v. United States (D.C. App. 1978) 390 A.2d 957, 967-969; United States v. Bishton (D.C.Cir. 1972) 463 F.2d 887, 890.) Indeed, the American Bar Association Standards for Criminal Justice (2d ed. 1980), Volume II, Chapter 12, Speedy Trial, std. 2.3 recommends in computing the time for trial Ã¢ÂÂthat (a) [t]he period of delay resulting from . . . interlocutory appeals . . .Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂbe excluded.


Respondent has conceded the PeopleÃ¢ÂÂs compliance with the California Rules of Court in securing preparation of the record on appeal.

Opinion
BERNSTEIN, J.
Introduction
The instant case presents the question of the constitutionality of unlimited consecutive sentences for persons convicted of multiple misdemeanors. Appellant argues, inter alia, that because Penal Code section1 1170.12 prohibits the general application of unlimited consecutive sentences *Supp. 15to persons convicted of multiple felonies, the failure of the Legislature to extend the same sentencing limitations to convicted misdemeanants constitutes a violation of the equal protection clauses of the United States and California Constitutions. We agree, and remand for resentencing. Because *Supp. 16the offenses in this case were Ã¢ÂÂwobblersÃ¢ÂÂ, i.e., were offenses chargeable either as felonies or as misdemeanors, we limit our holding to such cases. We deal with the various contentions of the parties below.
Facts
Appellant, Charles Cornelius Powell, stands convicted on his plea of 13 counts of grand theft in violation of section 487, subdivision l.3
Section 4894 declares grand theft to be a Ã¢ÂÂwobbler,Ã¢ÂÂ i.e., an offense punishable as either a misdemeanor (with a maximum custodial sentence of one year in the county jail) or as a felony (state prison commitment of sixteen months, two years or three years; see ÃÂ§ 18). Because the People chose to file the charges against appellant as misdemeanors, to which appellant offered no objection, the offenses were fixed as misdemeanors for all purposes pursuant to section 17, subdivision (b)(4).5 The trial court sentenced appellant to six months in the county jail per count, the sentences to run consecutively. Thus, appellant presently faces as a condition of probation six and one-half years in the county jail. Following his release from jail, appellant would remain on probation for an additional six and one-half years.
AppellantÃ¢ÂÂs Contentions
On this appeal, appellant posits two contentions. The first is that the sentence in the instant matter violates article I, section 17 of the California *Supp. 17Constitution (the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment). The second contention, though not clearly articulated by appellant, appears to be that the sentence constitutes a violation of the equal protection clause (art. I, ÃÂ§ 7) of the state Constitution inasmuch as appellant asserts that he faces a lengthier period of confinement for his misdemeanor convictions than the maximum period of confinement he could lawfully have been sentenced to had the same charges been brought as felonies. Although we conclude that the cruel and unusual punishment argument advanced by appellant is devoid of merit, we are persuaded that state and federal constitutional equal protection guaranties require that appellant be resentenced.
The Sentence Does Not Constitute Cruel and Unusual Punishment Under Article I, Section 17 of the California Constitution
The stateÃ¢ÂÂs constitutional guaranty against imposition of cruel and unusual punishment has been construed most recently in People v. Dillon (1983) 34 Cal.3d 441 [194 Cal.Rptr. 390, 668 P.2d 697]. In Dillon, at pages 477-478, the California Supreme Court reaffirmed the rule, first adopted in In re Lynch (1972) 8 Cal.3d 410 at page 424 [105 Cal.Rptr. 217, 503 P.2d 921], that Ã¢ÂÂa punishment may violate ... the Constitution if, although not cruel or unusual in its method, it is so disproportionate to the crime for which it is inflicted that it shocks the conscience and offends fundamental notions of human dignity [fn. omitted].Ã¢ÂÂ
Measured against the applicable standard, it cannot be said that appellantÃ¢ÂÂs six-and-one-half-year jail term, imposed pursuant to his conviction on thirteen counts of grand theft, is Ã¢ÂÂso disproportionate to the crime for which it is inflicted that it shocks the conscience and offends fundamental notions of human dignity.Ã¢ÂÂ Thus, we reject this contention.
AppellantÃ¢ÂÂs Sentence Violates the Equal Protection Clause of the California Constitution
Appellant argues that his six-and-one-half-year county jail commitment violates the state ConstitutionÃ¢ÂÂs guaranty of equal protection of the law. This is so, according to appellant, because a sentence of that length could not, consistent with the provisions of section 1170.1, subdivision (a)6 have been imposed upon him had the same charges been filed as felonies. Appellant variously calculates his maximum Ã¢ÂÂfelonyÃ¢ÂÂ sentence to be between seven years and three years and two months. The People counter with *Supp. 18their own set of calculations in which they arrive at a figure of nine years as representing appellantÃ¢ÂÂs maximum permissible Ã¢ÂÂfelonyÃ¢ÂÂ sentence.
The precise question presented here appears to be one of first impression, although several decisions, including one of this court (People v. Haendiges (1983) 142 Cal.App.3d Supp. 9 [191 Cal.Rptr. 785]), bear upon closely related issues. Despite the PeopleÃ¢ÂÂs contention that Haendiges, supra, is controlling and compels rejection of appellantÃ¢ÂÂs challenge, we have concluded that neither Haendiges nor any other case has directly addressed the question of the constitutionality of misdemeanor jail sentences which exceed the statutory maximum term of confinement for the identical crimes when charged as felonies.7
Strong support for appellantÃ¢ÂÂs argument is found in an opinion issued by the California Attorney General (63 Ops. Cal. Atty. Gen. 199 (1980)). The opinion deals with the question of unlimited consecutive sentencing for convicted misdemeanants found to be mentally disordered sex offenders, and for persons found not guilty of misdemeanor charges by reason of insanity. The Attorney General noted that for multiple felony convictions, section 1170.1 limited the maximum term of imprisonment which could be imposed. The opinion states: Ã¢ÂÂOn its face section 1170.1 is not applicable to misdemeanors. Penal Code section 669 provides that a court may order the sentences on multiple convictions to run concurrently or consecutively. The Supreme Court in People v. Carr (1936) 6 Cal.2d 227 held that Penal Code section 669 permitted a court to impose consecutive one year maximum jail terms for multiple misdemeanor convictions. (See Pen. Code, ÃÂ§ 19a.) Accordingly, it appears that section 6316.1, subdivision (c) provides that the maximum length of each misdemeanor term is to be aggregated without limit to compute the Ã¢ÂÂmaximum term of commitment,Ã¢ÂÂ despite the fact that under subdivision (a) of the same section multiple felony terms are computed on the basis of the Penal Code section 1170.1 formula.
*Supp. 19Ã¢ÂÂTo accept this construction without limitation would lead to absurd and clearly unintended results in some cases. Take for example the case of an MDSO who has an underlying conviction on seven counts of unlawful intercourse, in violation of Penal Code section 261.5 which is punishable as either a felony (sixteen months, two years in state prison) or a misdemeanor (not more than one year in county jail) depending upon the recommendation of the jury. (See Pen. Code, ÃÂ§ÃÂ§ 18, 264.) Under the above interpretation of section 6316.1, if the MDSO were convicted of seven misdemeanor counts, his maximum term of commitment would be seven years (one year for each offense). However, if he were convicted of seven felony counts, his maximum term of [cojmmitment would be six years.Ã¢ÂÂ (Fn. omitted.) (Id., at p. 202, Italics added.)
The opinion further states: Ã¢ÂÂThere still remains the issue of whether there is any constitutional limit on the consecutive terms which a court could impose for multiple convictions where one or more of the offenses are misdemeanors. The principle of equal protection of laws guaranteed by both the state and federal Constitutions requires that persons similarly situated must receive like treatment under the law. (In re Moye, 22 Cal. 3d 457, 465-466; People v. Olivas (1976) 17 Cal.3d 236.) In People v. Olivas, supra, the court struck down a provision in the Welfare and Institutions Code which authorized the Youth Authority to maintain control over convicted misdemeanants committed to its care as youthful offenders for a period in excess of the maximum jail term permitted by statute for the offense or offenses committed. The court found the right to liberty to be a fundamental interest and that the state failed to establish a compelling interest justifying a statutory distinction which would permit a youthful offender to be subject to a longer period of confinement than a regular adult offender.

Ã¢ÂÂIn the case of an MDSO, we have seen that if section 6316.1 were construed literally without regard to constitutional limitations, in some cases an MDSO with underlying misdemeanor convictions would be subject to a longer maximum term of commitment than that to which he would have been subject had the crimes of which he was convicted been felonies. That interpretation clearly would violate the principle of equal protection of laws.

Ã¢ÂÂHowever, that interpretation is not required. A statute is presumed constitutional and must be interpreted in harmony with constitutional requirements. (California Housing Finance Agency v. Elliott (1976) 17 Cal.3d 575, 594.) Section 6316.1, subdivision (c) limits the maximum term of commitment for multiple misdemeanors to the maximum Ã¢ÂÂwhich could have been imposedÃ¢ÂÂ by the court. Although the court in In re Eric J. stated that the one-third formula of Penal Code section 1170.1 was not applicable to misdemeanor sentences, and that courts have a certain amount of discretion *Supp. 20with regard to choosing the length of a misdemeanor term up to the statutory maximum, it did not suggest that a court could constitutionally aggregate misdemeanor terms so that a defendant would receive a longer period of incarceration than had the crimes of which he was convicted been felonies. We also note that the court in In re Eric J. pointed out that an adult who received a misdemeanor sentence consecutive to a felony sentence would not be subject to a continuous period of confinement under the supervision of the same correctional agency. In the case of an MDSO commitment, the defendant is subject to a continuous period of confinement at a state hospital or other mental health facility irrespective of whether the underlying convictions are for felonies or misdemeanors. (See ÃÂ§ÃÂ§ 6316, 6325.1.) We conclude that the principle of equal protection of laws would preclude a court from sentencing a defendant to a continuous period of confinement in county jail on the basis of consecutive misdemeanor counts for a term longer than he would have received had the crimes of which he was convicted been felonies. The phrase, Ã¢ÂÂwhich could be imposed,Ã¢ÂÂ in section 6316.1 incorporates the same principle of equal protection into the computation of the maximum term of commitment by the Board.
Ã¢ÂÂWe conclude, therefore, that section 6316.1, when construed in light of the constitutional requirement of equal protection of laws, provides that when aggregating the terms of underlying misdemeanors to determine the maximum term of commitment, the Board must use the statutory maximum jail term for each misdemeanor offense. However, the maximum term of commitment may not exceed that which would obtain had the offenses of which the defendant was convicted been felonies. Thus, there is an upper limit on the maximum term of commitment in cases where one or more of several underlying offenses are misdemeanors. In the case of conviction for a misdemeanor where the offense has an alternate felony sentence, (see Pen. Code, % 17) an MDSOÃ¢ÂÂs maximum term may not exceed the maximum term which he would have received had the crimes of which he was convicted been determined to be felonies rather than misdemeanors. In the case of misdemeanors with no alternative felony punishment, the MDSOÃ¢ÂÂs maximum term may not exceed the maximum term which he would have received had the misdemeanors of which he was convicted been punishable as felonies under Penal Code section 18, i. e., with a minimum determinate sentence of sixteen months, two years or three years.Ã¢ÂÂ (Id., at pp. 205-207, italics added.)
The conclusion of the Attorney General was: Ã¢ÂÂThe maximum term of commitment within meaning of Welfare and Institutions Code section 6316.1 and Penal Code section 1026.5 with respect to misdemeanors is computed by adding the maximum jail term for each such misdemeanor to any maximum term of commitment for felonies as computed under those *Supp. 21sections provided that the resulting maximum term of commitment may not exceed that which would result if the same misdemeanor offenses had been punished as felonies. For the purpose of determining such limit on the maximum term of commitment, those misdemeanor offenses which do not have alternative felony terms prescribed by law should be treated as if they had been a felony with punishment as prescribed by Penal Code section 18.Ã¢ÂÂ (Id., at p. 200, italics added.)
It must be observed that the present state statutory scheme for sentencing persons convicted of crimes would seem to permit the imposition of unlimited consecutive sentences for multiple convictions of misdemeanor offenses. In particular, section 19a provides as follows: Ã¢ÂÂIn no case shall any person sentenced to confinement in a county or city jail, or in a county or joint county penal farm, road camp, work camp, or other county adult detention facility, or committed to the sheriff for placement in any such county adult detention facility, on conviction of a misdemeanor, or as a condition of probation upon conviction of either a felony or a misdemeanor, or upon commitment for civil contempt, or upon default in the payment of a fine upon conviction of either a felony or a misdemeanor, or for any reason except upon conviction of more than one offense when consecutive sentences have been imposed, be committed for a period in excess of one year; provided, however, that the time allowed on parole shall not be considered as a part of the period of confinement.Ã¢ÂÂ
When enacted in 1933 (Stats. 1933, ch. 848, ÃÂ§ 2, p. 2217), section 19a did not contain any language excepting Ã¢ÂÂconvictions of more than one offense when consecutive sentences have been imposed.Ã¢ÂÂ The statute was amended in 1957 to include this clarification (Stats. 1957, ch. 139, ÃÂ§ 2, p. 734. However, even before the 1957 amendment, section 19aÃ¢ÂÂs one-year maximum provision had been construed to mean one year per count in cases where multiple convictions had been suffered. (People v. Carr (1936) 6 Cal.2d 227, 228 [57 P.2d 489]; see, also, People v. Bailey (1983) 140 Cal.App.3d 828, 830 fn. 2 [189 Cal.Rptr. 918].)
It is plain that, prior to the enactment of the determinate sentencing law (hereinafter, DSL) (Stats. 1976, ch. 1139, ÃÂ§ 273, p. 5140), the imposition of unlimited consecutive sentences for multiple misdemeanor convictions did not run afoul of any constitutional protections afforded criminal defendants. Felons could be similarly sentenced for multiple convictions under the provisions of section 669.8 However, with the enactment of DSL, the Leg*Supp. 22islature abolished such sentencing practices as to felons (except under certain specified circumstances, see, e.g., ÃÂ§ÃÂ§ 667.5, 667.6). In so doing, the Legislature Ã¢ÂÂclearly indicated its intent that the aggregation provisions of Penal Code section 1170.1, which limit consecutive terms to one-third of the middle determinate term, apply only in imposing sentence for felonies.Ã¢ÂÂ (In re Eric J. (1979) 25 Cal.3d 522 at p. 537 [159 Cal.Rptr. 317, 601 P.2d 549].) Nevertheless, if a legislative action has the effect of denying to any person(s) rights secured under the federal or state Constitutions, it is of no moment that such denial may have in fact reflected the true intent of the Legislature. Thus, in Eric J., supra, the California Supreme Court held that the provisions of section 1170.1 limiting consecutive felony terms to one-third of the base term applied with equal force to a situation in which a defendant faced consecutive sentences for convictions of one felony and one misdemeanor. Accordingly, the Eric J. court treated the misdemeanor conviction as the Ã¢ÂÂsubordinateÃ¢ÂÂ term, and held that, as such, the term could not exceed one-third of the maximum sentence that could have been imposed had the misdemeanor alone been charged. (Id., 25 Cal.3d at pp. 536-538.)  it is clear that, to the extent it applies, the Eric J. decision is supportive of appellantÃ¢ÂÂs contention that unlimited consecutive sentencing of persons convicted of multiple misdemeanor offenses violates his right to equal protection of the law.9
*Supp. 23AppellantÃ¢ÂÂs Maximum Ã¢ÂÂFelonyÃ¢ÂÂ Sentence
Under section 1170.1, subdivision (a), subordinate terms for nonviolent felonies may not exceed five years, regardless of the number of such charges for which the defendant suffers conviction. Section 1170.1, subdivision (g)10 (formerly ÃÂ§ 1170.1, subd. (f)) further limits the total allowable period of confinement to twice the base term, absent certain conditions such as the imposition of any enhancements pursuant to section 12022, 12022.5, 12022.6, or 12022.7. Appellant was convicted of violation of section 487, subdivision 1 which, when tried as a felony, carries an upper term of three years. If appellantÃ¢ÂÂs sentence is controlled by section 1170.1, subdivision (g), his maximum possible Ã¢ÂÂfelonyÃ¢ÂÂ sentence would be limited to six years, or twice the base term.
However, the People argue that Ã¢ÂÂthe record before this courtÃ¢ÂÂ establishes that several of the counts to which appellant pleaded guilty involved a Ã¢ÂÂtakingÃ¢ÂÂ in excess of $25,000. Thus, the People argue, the provisions of section 12022.6, subdivision (a),11 are brought into play. Were we to accept this argument, its effect would be twofold: (1) it would add three years to appellantÃ¢ÂÂs sentence pursuant to the operation of the one-year enhancement periods provided for by that subsection; and, (2) it would operate to remove the Ã¢ÂÂtwice the base termÃ¢ÂÂ restriction of section 1170.1, subdivision (g). The only remaining restriction on the length of appellantÃ¢ÂÂs Ã¢ÂÂsentenceÃ¢ÂÂ would then be the five-year limit on subordinate terms provided for by section 1170.1, subdivision (a). Under these circumstances, appellantÃ¢ÂÂs maximum Ã¢ÂÂsentenceÃ¢ÂÂ would be the sum of the base term (three years), the subordinate terms (five years), and the enhancement imposed pursuant to section 12022.6, subdivision (a) (one year), for a total of nine years. The *Supp. 24People argue that Ã¢ÂÂit would be unfair to the People to base any ruling that the instant sentence exceeds the maximum possible felony sentence on the absence of evidence that the section 12022.6 enhancement would apply.Ã¢ÂÂ
We reject the PeopleÃ¢ÂÂs proposition. Before the enhancement of a felony sentence pursuant to the provisions of section 12022.6, subdivision (a) may occur, the statute requires that Ã¢ÂÂ[t]he additional terms provided in this section shall not be imposed unless the facts of the taking, damage, or destruction in excess of the amounts provided in this section are charged in the accusatory pleading and admitted or found to be true by the trier of fact.Ã¢ÂÂ Further, Ã¢ÂÂ[a] section 12022.6 enhancement must be proven beyond a reasonÃÂ¡ble doubt.Ã¢ÂÂ (People v. Kellett (1982) 134 Cal.App.3d 949, 958, fn. 2 [185 Cal.Rptr. 1].)
AppellantÃ¢ÂÂs plea of guilty to the charged thefts does not constitute an admission that the amounts alleged in the various counts of the complaint are correct.12
                   In a felony prosecution in which an enhanced sentence is sought, the defendant may choose to admit his guilt of the charge, but deny the allegations which would form the basis of the enhancement. If the prosecution still desires to seek an enhanced sentence, it must proceed to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the pleaded facts justifying an enhanced sentence are true. The defendant in such a case may of course present evidence to the contrary.  However, appellant herein, as a result of the PeopleÃ¢ÂÂs decision to institute only misdemeanor proceedings, has been afforded no opportunity to dispute the amounts alleged in the complaint. As stated, appellantÃ¢ÂÂs plea did not operate as an admission that the amounts alleged in the complaint against him were true, because these amounts were neither admitted nor proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Section 12022.6 thus cannot form the basis of any increase in appellantÃ¢ÂÂs sentence. Accordingly, we calculate appellantÃ¢ÂÂs maximum Ã¢ÂÂfelonyÃ¢ÂÂ sentence to be six years.
As to the period of probation imposed, since section 1203.1 governing probation in felony cases provides a maximum probationary period equivalent to the maximum permissible time of confinement as computed per section 1170.1, we hold that the maximum period of probation to which appellant could be subject is six years. We note that this holding creates no *Supp. 25conflict between section 1203.113 governing felony probation and section 1203a governing misdemeanor probation as both sections limit the maxi-
*Supp. 26mum period of probation to the maximum possible period of confinement which, in the instant case, is six years.
Finally, we note that the People express a valid concern over an Ã¢ÂÂanomalyÃ¢ÂÂ they fear will be created by the instant holding: Ã¢ÂÂConsecutive sentences on the most serious misdemeanor offenses, i.e., Ã¢ÂÂwobblers,Ã¢ÂÂ are to be limited . . . while consecutive sentences for the presumably less serious remaining misdemeanor offenses would remain unlimited.Ã¢ÂÂ Although the instant case involved Ã¢ÂÂwobblerÃ¢ÂÂ offenses, it is quite clear that unlimited consecutive sentencing could not constitutionally be abolished for persons convicted of Ã¢ÂÂwobblersÃ¢ÂÂ while remaining in force for persons convicted of other, less serious misdemeanors. Though we may only reach the question in dictum at this point, it appears that the solution to the problem is the one suggested by the California Attorney General at 63 Ops. Cal. Atty. Gen. 199, 207: Ã¢ÂÂIn the case of misdemeanors with no alternative felony punishment, the MDSOÃ¢ÂÂs maximum term may not exceed the maximum term which he would have received had the misdemeanors of which he was convicted been punishable as felonies under Penal Code section 18, i.e., with a minimum determinate sentence of sixteen months, two years or three years.Ã¢ÂÂ (Id., atpp. 205-207.)
Ã¢ÂÂFor the purpose of determining such limit on the maximum term of commitment, those misdemeanor offenses which do not have alternative felony terms prescribed by law should be treated as if they had been a felony with punishment as prescribed by Penal Code section 18.Ã¢ÂÂ (Id., at p. 200.)
The judgment is modified as to sentence, and as modified, is affirmed. On remand the trial court is instructed to resentence defendant in accordance *Supp. 27with the views expressed herein.
Reese, P. J., and Shabo, J., concurred.

Unless otherwise stated, all sections refer to the Penal Code.


Section 1170.1 provides as follows:
Ã¢ÂÂ(a) Except as provided in subdivision (c) and subject to Section 654, when any person is convicted of two or more felonies, whether in the same proceeding or court or in different proceedings or courts, and whether by judgment rendered by the same or by a different court, and a consecutive term of imprisonment is imposed under Sections 669 and 1170, the aggregate term of imprisonment for all such convictions shall be the sum of the principal term, the subordinate term and any additional term imposed pursuant to Section 667.5, 667.6, or 12022.1. The principal term shall consist of the greatest term of imprisonment imposed by the court for any of the crimes, including any enhancements imposed pursuant to Section 12022, 12022.3, 12022.5, 12022.6, 12022.7 or 12022.8. The subordinate term for each consecutive offense which is not a Ã¢ÂÂviolent felonyÃ¢ÂÂ as defined in subdivision (c) of Section 667.5 shall consist of one-third of the middle term of imprisonment prescribed for each other such felony conviction for which a consecutive term of imprisonment is imposed, and shall exclude any enhancements. In no case shall the total of subordinate terms for such consecutive offenses which are not Ã¢ÂÂviolent feloniesÃ¢ÂÂ as defined in subdivision (c) of Section 667.5 exceed five years. The subordinate term for each consecutive offense which is a Ã¢ÂÂviolent felonyÃ¢ÂÂ as defined in subdivision (c) of Section 667.5, including those offenses described in paragraph (8) of subdivision (c) of Section 667.5, shall consist of one-third of the middle term of imprisonment prescribed for each other such felony conviction for which a consecutive term of imprisonment is imposed, and shall include one-third of any enhancements imposed pursuant to Section 12022, 12022.5 or 12022.7.
Ã¢ÂÂ(b) When a consecutive term of imprisonment is imposed under Sections 669 and 1170
*Supp. 15for two or more conviction's for kidnapping, as defined in Section 207, involving both separate victims and separate occasions, the aggregate term shall be calculated as provided in subdivision (a), except that the subordinate term for each subsequent kidnapping conviction shall consist of the middle term for each kidnapping conviction for which a consecutive term of imprisonment is imposed and shall include one-third of any enhancements imposed pursuant to Section 12022, 12022.5, or 12022.7. The five-year limitation on the total of subordinate terms provided in subdivision (a) shall not apply to subordinate terms for second and subsequent convictions of kidnapping, as defined in Section 207, involving separate victims and separate occasions.
Ã¢ÂÂ(c) In the case of any person convicted of one or more felonies committed while such person is confined in a state prison, or is subject to reimprisonment for escape from such custody and the law either requires the terms to be served consecutively or the court imposes consecutive terms, the term of imprisonment for all such convictions which such person is required to serve consecutively shall commence from the time such person would otherwise have been released from prison. If the new offenses are consecutive with each other, the principal and subordinate terms shall be calculated as provided in subdivision (a), except that the total of subordinate terms may exceed five years. The provisions of this subdivision shall be applicable in cases of convictions of more titan one offense in different proceedings, and convictions of more than one offense in the same or different proceedings.
Ã¢ÂÂ(d) When the court imposes a prison sentence for a felony pursuant to Section 1170 the court shall also impose the additional terms provided in Sections 667.5, 12022, 12022.5, 12022.6, and 12022.7, unless the additional punishment therefore is stricken pursuant to subdivision (g). The court shall also impose any other additional term which the court determines in its discretion or as required by law shall run consecutive to the term imposed under Section 1170. In considering the imposition of such additional term, the court shall apply the sentencing rules of the Judicial Council.
Ã¢ÂÂ(e) When two or more enhancements under Sections 12022, 12022.5, and 12022.7 may be imposed for any single offense, only the greatest enhancement shall apply; however, in cases of robbery, rape or burglary, or attempted robbery, rape or burglary the court may impose both (1) one enhancement for weapons as provided in either Section 12022 or 12022.5 and (2) an enhancement for great bodily injury as provided in Section 12022.7.
Ã¢ÂÂ(f) The enhancements provided in Sections 667.5, 667.6, 12022, 12022.1, 12022.3, 12022.5, 12022.6, 12022.7, and 12022.8 shall be pleaded and proven as provided by law.
Ã¢ÂÂ(g) The term of imprisonment shall not exceed twice the number of years imposed by the trial court as the base term pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 1170 unless the defendant stands convicted of a Ã¢ÂÂviolent felonyÃ¢ÂÂ as defined in subdivision (c) of Section 667.5, or a consecutive sentence is being imposed pursuant to subdivision (c) of this section, or an enhancement is imposed pursuant to Section 12022, 12022.5, 12022.6 or 12022.7 or the defendant stands convicted of felony escape from an institution in which he is lawfully confined.
Ã¢ÂÂ(h) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the court may strike the additional punishment for the enhancements provided in Sections 667.5, 12022, 12022.5, 12022.6, and 12022.7 if it determines that there are circumstances in mitigation of the additional punishment and states on the record its reasons for striking the additional punishment.
Ã¢ÂÂ(i) For any violation of subdivision (2) or (3) of Section 261, Section 264.1, subdivision (b) of Section 288, Section 289, or sodomy dr oral copulation by force, violence, duress, menace or threat of great bodily harm as provided in Section 286 or 288a, the number of enhancements which may be imposed shall not be limited, regardless of whether such enhancements are pursuant to this or some other section of law. Each of such enhancements shall be a full and separately served enhancement and shall not be merged with any term or with any other enhancement. Ã¢ÂÂ


Section 487, subdivision 1 at the time in question provided as follows: Ã¢ÂÂGrand theft is theft committed in any of the following cases: [1] 1. When the money, labor or real or personal property taken is of a value exceeding four hundred dollars ($400); provided, that when domestic fowls, avocados, olives, citrus or deciduous fruits, other fruits, vegetables, nuts, artichokes, or other farm crops are taken of a value exceeding one hundred dollars ($100); provided, further, that when fish, shellfish, mollusks, crustaceans, kelp, algae, or other aquacultural products are taken from a commercial or research operation which is producing that product, of a value exceeding one hundred dollars ($100); provided, further, that where the money, labor, real or personal property is taken by a servant, agent or employee from his principal or employer and aggregates four hundred dollars ($400) or more in any 12 consecutive month period, then the same shall constitute grand theft.Ã¢ÂÂ


Section 489 provides as follows: Ã¢ÂÂGrand theft is punishable by imprisonment in the county jail for not more than one year or in the state prison.Ã¢ÂÂ


Section 17, subdivision (b)(4) provides as follows: Ã¢ÂÂ(b) When a crime is punishable, in the discretion of the court, by imprisonment in the state prison or by fine or imprisonment in the county jail, it is a misdemeanor for all purposes under the following circumstances: [f] (4) When the prosecuting attorney files in a court having jurisdiction over misdemeanor offenses a complaint specifying that the offense is a misdemeanor, unless the defendant at the time of his arraignment or plea objects to the offense being made a misdemeanor, in which event the complaint shall be amended to charge the felony and the case shall proceed on the felony complaint.Ã¢ÂÂ


See footnote 2.


Haendiges involved Ã¢ÂÂseveral offenses relating to his driving under the influence of drugs and alcohol, or both.Ã¢ÂÂ (142 Cal.App.3d Supp. 9). The Haendiges court cited as Ã¢ÂÂbinding precedentÃ¢ÂÂ two cases: People v. Fowler (1980) 109 Cal.App.3d 557 [167 Cal.Rptr. 235], and In re Eric J. (1979) 25 Cal.3d 522 [159 Cal.Rptr. 317, 601 P.2d 549]. Fowler concerned two concurrent misdemeanor sentences which were to be served consecutively to a state prison commitment which had been imposed for a separate felony conviction. The two misdemeanor convictions were for offenses (ÃÂ§ 192, subd. 3(a)) which could have been prosecuted as felonies under section 193, subdivision (c), and, as such, would have carried sentences of sixteen months, two years or three years. Fowler had received the middle term of two years for her felony conviction. Thus, the total time in custody to which Fowler was sentenced was three years. Had the Ã¢ÂÂwobblerÃ¢ÂÂ charges been prosecuted as felonies, Fowler could have received a maximum sentence of three years and four months. Clearly, Fowler has no application whatever to the issues presented by the instant case. The effect of In re Eric J. is discussed elsewhere in this opinion.


Section 669, prior to its amendment in 1978 to bring it in line with the provisions of the then newly enacted DSL, read as follows: Ã¢ÂÂWhen any person is convicted of two or more crimes, whether in the same proceeding or court or in different proceedings or courts, and whether by judgment rendered by the same judge or by different judges, the second or other *Supp. 22subsequent judgment shall direct whether the terms of imprisonment or any of them to which he is sentenced shall run concurrently, or whether the imprisonment to which he is or has been sentenced upon the second or other subsequent conviction shall commence at the termination of the first term of imprisonment to which he has been sentenced, or at the termination of the second or subsequent term of imprisonment to which he has been sentenced, as the case may be; provided, however, if the punishment for any of said crimes is expressly prescribed to be life imprisonment, whether with or without possibility of parole, then the terms of imprisonment on the other convictions, whether prior or subsequent, shall be merged and run concurrently with such life term. In the event that the court at the time of pronouncing the second or other judgment upon such person had no knowledge of a prior existing judgment or judgments, or having knowledge, fails to determine how the terms of imprisonment shall run in relation to each other, then, upon such failure so to determine, or upon such prior judgment or judgments being brought to the attention of the court at any time prior to the expiration of 6ÃÂ days from and after the actual commencement of imprisonment upon the second or other subsequent judgments, the court shall, in the absence of the defendant and within 60 days of such notice, determine how the term of imprisonment upon said second or other subsequent judgment shall run with reference to the prior incompleted term or terms of imprisonment. Upon the failure of the court so to determine how the terms of imprisonment on the second or subsequent judgment shall run, the term of imprisonment on the second or subsequent judgment shall run concurrently.
Ã¢ÂÂThe State Board of Prison Directors shall advise the court pronouncing the second or other subsequent judgment of the existence of all prior judgments against the defendant, the terms of imprisonment upon which have not been completely served.Ã¢ÂÂ


The People correctly argue that the Eric J. decision was not based upon a finding of a denial of equal protection. However, the equal protection issue in Eric J. hinged upon the courtÃ¢ÂÂs determination in that case that juveniles confined pursuant to the sustaining of a juvenile.court petition, and adults confined pursuant to criminal process, were not Ã¢ÂÂsimilarly situatedÃ¢ÂÂ for purposes of equal protecdon analysis. The Eric J. court found that the two groups were not confined for the saifie purpose [punishment is the declared purpose of *Supp. 23confining adults (ÃÂ§ 1170, subd. (a)(1)) whereas rehabilitation is the declared purpose of confining juveniles], and, moreover, that juveniles did not possess the fundamental liberty interest of adults. Thus, no violation of equal protection was found by the Eric J. court. On the other hand, the instant case necessitates a contrary finding. Felons and misdemeanants are confined for the same purpose, and both have identical fundamental liberty interests. Thus, the People suggest, the equal protection portion of Eric J. has no applicability to the instant case. We agree. Our discussion of Eric J. is merely for the purpose of illustrating that the Ã¢ÂÂexclusiveÃ¢ÂÂ application of section 1170.1 to felonies is not an absolute, regardless of what the legislative intent may have been. We do not suggest that Eric J. itself constitutes authority for our holding that equal protection guaranties require an end to unlimited consecutive sentencing in misdemeanor prosecutions so long as the Legislature has seen fit to so limit consecutive sentencing in felony prosecutions. Neither Eric J., nor, to our knowledge, any other post-DSL case addresses this question.


See footnote 2.


 Ã¢ÂÂAny person who takes, damages or destroys any property in the commission or attempted commission of a felony, with the intent to cause such taking, damage or destruction, and the loss exceeds: [1] (a) Twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000), the court shall in addition and consecutive to the punishment prescribed for the felony or attempted felony of which the defendant has been convicted impose an additional term of one year.Ã¢ÂÂ


The only Ã¢ÂÂamountÃ¢ÂÂ admitted by the guilty plea is that the takings exceeded the statutory minimum required for grand (as opposed to petty) theft. See section 487, subdivision 1.


Section 1203.1 provides as follows: Ã¢ÂÂThe court or judge thereof, in the order granting probation, may suspend the imposing, or the execution of the sentence and may direct that such suspension may continue for such period of time not exceeding the maximum possible term of such sentence, except as hereinafter set forth, and upon such terms and conditions as it shall determine. The court, or judge thereof, in the order granting probation and as a condition thereof may imprison the defendant in the county jail for a period not exceeding the maximum time fixed by law in the instant case; provided, however, that where the maximum possible term of such sentence is five years or less, then such period of suspension of imposition or execution of sentence may, in the discretion of the court, continue for not over five years; may fine the defendant in such sum not to exceed the maximum fine provided by law in such case; or may in connection with granting probation, impose either imprisonment in county jail, or fine, or both, or neither, shall provide for restitution in proper cases; and may require bonds for the faithful observance and performance of any or all of the conditions of probation.
Ã¢ÂÂThe court shall consider whether the defendant as a condition of probation shall make restitution to the victim or the Indemnity Fund if assistance has been granted to the victim pursuant to Article 1 (commencing with Section 13959) of Chapter 5 of Part 4 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code.' Any restitution payment received by a probation department in the form of cash or money order shall be forwarded to the victim within 30 days from the date the payment is received by the department. Any restitution payment received by a probation department in the form of a check or draft shall be forwarded to the victim within 45 days from the date the payment is received by the department. In cases where the court has ordered the defendant to pay restitution to multiple victims and where the administrative cost of disbursing restitution payments to multiple victims involves a significant cost, any restitution payment received by a probation department shall be forwarded to multiple victims when it is cost effective to do so, but in no event shall restitution disbursements be delayed beyond 90 days from the date the payment is received by the probation department. In counties or cities and counties where road camps, farms, or other public work is available the court may place the probationer in such camp, farms, or other public work instead of in jail, and Section 25359 of the Government Code shall apply to probation and the court shall have the same power to require adult probationers to work, as prisoners confined in the county jail are required to work, at public work as therein provided; and supervisors of the several counties are hereby authorized to provide public work and to fix the scale of compensation of such adult probationers in their respective counties. In all cases of probation the court is authorized to require as a condition of probation that the probationer go to work and earn money for the support of his or her dependents or to pay any fine imposed or reparation condition, to keep an account of his or her earnings, to report the same to the probation officer and apply such earnings as directed by the court.
Ã¢ÂÂIn all such cases if as a condition of probation a judge of the superior court sitting by authority of law elsewhere than at the county seat requires a convicted person to serve sentence at intermittent periods such sentence may be served on the order of the judge at the city jail nearest to the place at which the court is sitting, and the cost of his or her maintenance shall be a county charge.
Ã¢ÂÂThe court may impose and require any or all of the above-mentioned terms of imprisonment, fine and conditions and other reasonable conditions, as it may determine are fitting and proper to the end that justice may be done, that amends may be made to society for the breach of the law, for any injury done to any person resulting from such breach and generally and specifically for the reformation and rehabilitation of the probationer, that should the probationer violate any of the terms or conditions imposed by the court in the instant matter, it shall have authority to modify and change any and all such terms and conditions and to reimprison the probationer in the county jail within the limitations of the penalty of the public offense involved.

Ã¢ÂÂIf the court orders restitution to be made to the victim, the board of supervisors may add a fee to cover the actual administrative cost of collecting restitution but not to exceed 2 percent of the total amount ordered to be paid. The fees shall be paid into the general fund of the county treasury for the use and benefit of the county.
Ã¢ÂÂThis section shall remain in effect only until January 1, 1989, and as of that date is repealed, unless a later enacted statute which is chaptered before January 1, 1989, deletes or extends that date. Ã¢ÂÂ

Opinion
BERNSTEIN, J.Ã¢ÂÂIn
this appeal, we examine a Whittier Municipal Court Ã¢ÂÂpolicyÃ¢ÂÂ for sentencing defendants convicted of violating subdivision (b) of section 23152 of the Vehicle Code (driving with a blood-alcohol level of 0.10 percent).1
                   We conclude that the policy in question violates the right of defendants to individualized sentencing and due process.
*Supp. 3Appellant Justice entered a plea of nolo contendere to the charge of violating subdivision (b) of section 23152. At the time of sentencing, he requested probation pursuant to section 23161.2 If a court decides to place a defendant on probation for a first time conviction of subdivision (b) of section 23152, it has two options: 1) sentence the defendant to a minimum of 48 hours in county jail or 2) restrict the driving privilege for 90 days. In addition, the court can impose a fine under either option.
The trial court granted the appellantÃ¢ÂÂs request for probation but denied his request for the license restriction rather than the 48 hours jail time. The court based its decision on a policy which provides as follows: Ã¢ÂÂIt is the policy of the court and the District Attorney that there will be no license suspension option open to defendants on a first offense deuce on the date of trial if the matter has been pretried.Ã¢ÂÂ The appellant was placed on probation under the following conditions: that he attend a level I alcohol school, pay a fine of $390, plus a penalty of $272, and serve two days in custody.
It is well established that in sentencing a defendant, the trial judge is required to exercise discretion and impose a sentence based on the singular aspects of the case. In Pennsylvania v. Ashe (1937) 302 U.S. 51 [82 L.Ed. 43, 58 S.Ct. 59], the defendant challenged a state law authorizing the sentencing court to imprison convicts convicted of breaking out of the penitentiary for a period not to exceed the original sentence. In his petition for a writ of habeas corpus, Ashe argued that the law violated the equal protection clause of the federal Constitution because it permitted the trial judge to mete out different terms for two convicts who escape under identical circumstances. (Id., at p. 55 [82 L.Ed. at p. 46].) The offenderÃ¢ÂÂs past, the court suggested, Ã¢ÂÂindicate[s] his present purposes and tendencies and . . . suggests] the period of restraint and the kind of discipline that ought to be imposed on him.Ã¢ÂÂ (Ibid.)
*Supp. 4A practice, such as the Whittier court policy at issue, effectively removes the discretion of the trial judge to fashion a punishment which reflects both the peculiar circumstances of the crime and the characteristics of the defendant. (See People v. Cheatham (1979) 23 Cal.3d 829, 835 [153 Cal.Rptr. 585, 591 P.2d 1237]; People v. Lock (1981) 30 Cal.3d 454, 457, fa. 5 [179 Cal.Rptr. 56, 637 P.2d 292]; cf. People v. Arnold (1976) 58 Cal.App.3d Supp. 1, 7 [132 Cal.Rptr. 922].)
In In re Lewallen (1979) 23 Cal.3d 274 [152 Cal.Rptr. 528, 590 P.2d 383, 100 A.L.R.3d 823], the California Supreme Court vacated the sentence of a defendant who received much harsher punishment upon conviction after trial than the negotiated sentence offered him under a plea bargain. The court in Lewallen observed that: Ã¢ÂÂJust as a trial judge is precluded from offering an accused in return for a guilty plea a more lenient sentence than he would impose after trial, ... so he is precluded from imposing a more severe sentence because the accused elects to proceed to trial. Trial courts may not thus chill the exercise of the constitutional right to trial by jury.Ã¢ÂÂ (Id., at p. 281.) The Whittier court policy at issue permits the trial court to impose a harsher sentence because the defendant exercised his right to plead Ã¢ÂÂnot guiltyÃ¢ÂÂ and proceed to trial. This practice violates the right to trial by jury. (Ibid.; People v. Superior Court (Feldmann) (1976) 59 Cal.App.3d 270, 276 [130 Cal.Rptr. 548]; People v. Morales (1967) 252 Cal.App.2d 537, 544-547 [60 Cal.Rptr. 671].)
We conclude that the Whittier court policy in penalizing defendants who do not plead at an early stage of the proceedings infringes on the right to trial by jury and in limiting the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs discretion in the determination of sentence violates the established principle of individualized sentencing. We cannot tolerate a sentencing procedure which limits the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs discretion or is based on improper considerations which deny offenders the right to individualized treatment. We find equally offensive any efforts to facilitate court processes by offering offenders a bonus for an early plea and a penalty for a Ã¢ÂÂnot guiltyÃ¢ÂÂ plea.
We, therefore, hold that the Whittier court policy is clearly improper and an abuse of the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs discretion.
The judgment is modified as to sentence and as modified is affirmed. Upon remand the trial court is instructed to set aside the sentence and to resentence defendant/appellant in accordance with the views expressed in this *Supp. 5opinion. (People v. Bolton (1979) 23 Cal.3d 208, 218 [152 Cal.Rptr. 141, 589 P.2d 396].)
Reese, P. J., and Cooperman, J., concurred.

Section 23161, in pertinent part, provides: Ã¢ÂÂ(a) If the court grants probation to any person punished under Section 23160, in addition to the provisions of Section 23206 and any other terms and conditions imposed by the court, the court shall impose as a condition of probation that the person be subject to one of the following:
Ã¢ÂÂ(1) Be confined in the county jail for at least 48 hours but not more than six months and pay a fine of at least three hundred ninety dollars ($390) but not more than five hundred dollars ($500). The court may order the Department of Motor Vehicles to suspend the privilege to operate a motor vehicle pursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) of Section 13352 when this condition of probation is imposed.
Ã¢ÂÂ(2) Pay a fine of at least three hundred ninety dollars ($390) but not more than five hundred dollars ($500) and have the privilege to operate a motor vehicle restricted for 90 days to necessary travel to and from that personÃ¢ÂÂs place of employment and to and from the treatment program described in subdivision (b) and, if driving a motor vehicle is necessary to perform the duties of the personÃ¢ÂÂs employment, restricted to driving in that personÃ¢ÂÂs scope of employment.Ã¢ÂÂ

*Supp. 9Opinion
COUZENS, P. J.
In this appeal we examine that relatively rare circumstance where a jury verdict is returned in an amount that falls between offers to compromise made by plaintiff and defendants under Code of Civil Procedure section 998.1
Factual Background
Plaintiff filed an action to recover damages for personal injury arising out of an auto accident on December 11, 1982. Defendants filed an offer to compromise the case pursuant to section 998 for $2,755. Plaintiff filed a similar offer for $6,999. Neither offer was accepted. In the ensuing jury trial, a verdict of $2,400 was returned in favor of plaintiff. The trial court awarded costs to plaintiff in the sum of $2,667.81. Defendants appeal from that portion of the judgment which awarded costs. We will affirm the judgment, with a modification of costs awarded.
Discussion
Defendants contend (1) that plaintiff was not the Ã¢ÂÂprevailing partyÃ¢ÂÂ under section 1031; (2) that the trial court improperly added certain preoffer costs to the jury verdict to provide plaintiff Ã¢ÂÂa more favorable judgmentÃ¢ÂÂ than defendantsÃ¢ÂÂ section 998 offer; (3) that neither party Ã¢ÂÂprevailedÃ¢ÂÂ and, therefore, the costs should be equitably apportioned between the parties; and (4) that certain specific costs were improperly allowed. We reject all but a portion of the last contention.
I
The awarding of costs in municipal or justice court actions is controlled initially by section 1031. That section provides that Ã¢ÂÂ[t]he prevailing party . . . is entitled to his costs and necessary disbursements.Ã¢ÂÂ  Defendants argue that since the juryÃ¢ÂÂs verdict of $2,400 was less than defendantsÃ¢ÂÂ section 998 offer of $2,755, plaintiff cannot be considered the Ã¢ÂÂprevailing party.Ã¢ÂÂ Defendants are wrong. The Ã¢ÂÂprevailing partyÃ¢ÂÂ is simply that party in whose favor the judgment is entered. (See Hyatt v. Sierra Boat Co. (1978) 79 Cal.App.3d 325, 350 [145 Cal.Rptr. 47]; Ferraro v. Southern Cal. Gas Co. (1980) 102 Cal.App.3d 33, 52 [162 Cal.Rptr. 238]; Strickland v. Becks (1979) 95 Cal.App.3d Supp. 18 [157 Cal.Rptr. 656]; 4 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (2d ed. 1971) Judgment, ÃÂ§ 84, p. 3245.) Plaintiff in the present action claimed monetary damages; defendants denied them; the jury agreed *Supp. 10with plaintiff. Plaintiff clearly Ã¢ÂÂprevailedÃ¢ÂÂ in the action. The concept of Ã¢ÂÂprevailing partyÃ¢ÂÂ bears no relationship to the Ã¢ÂÂmore favorable judgmentÃ¢ÂÂ language contained in section 998. As we shall discuss below, section 998 supplements section 1031, but does not define its terms. Costs, therefore, were allowable to plaintiff under section 1031, subject to adjustment pursuant to the provisions of section 998.
II
Section 9982 provides initially that Ã¢ÂÂcosts allowed under Sections 1031 and 1032 shall be withheld or augmentedÃ¢ÂÂ as provided in that section. Since each party is permitted to submit offers to take judgment Ã¢ÂÂin accordance with the terms and conditions stated at that time,Ã¢ÂÂ it is appropriate to review the terms of the offers made by each party in light of the juryÃ¢ÂÂs verdict. Such an analysis will determine whether plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs section 1031 costs should be Ã¢ÂÂwithheld or augmented.Ã¢ÂÂ
Plaintiff offered to take judgment against defendants for the sum of $6,999, each party to bear its own costs and fees. Ã¢ÂÂIf an offer made by a plaintiff is not accepted and the defendant fails to obtain a more favorable judgment,Ã¢ÂÂ the court can compel the defendant to pay certain expert witness costs. (ÃÂ§ 998, subd. (d).) Since the juryÃ¢ÂÂs verdict was less than $6,999, the defendants did obtain a more favorable judgment. Accordingly, section 998, subdivision (d) will not modify the award of costs specified by section 1031.
Defendants offered to take judgment against them for Ã¢ÂÂ$2,755.00, which sum includes taxable costs incurred to date of judgment.Ã¢ÂÂ (Italics added.) Ã¢ÂÂIf an offer made by a defendant is not accepted and the plaintiff fails to *Supp. 11obtain a more favorable judgment, the plaintiff shall not recover his costs and shall pay the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs costs from the time of the offer.Ã¢ÂÂ (ÃÂ§ 998, subd. (c).) Since defendantsÃ¢ÂÂ offer includes consideration of taxable costs, we look not only to the amount of the jury award of damages but also to those costs which otherwise would be allowable to plaintiff under section 1031, as of the date of the offer. (Shain v. City of Albany (1980) 106 Cal.App.3d 294, 299 [165 Cal.Rptr. 69]; Bennett v. Brown (1963) 212 Cal.App.2d 685, 688-689 [28 Cal.Rptr. 485].)
DefendantsÃ¢ÂÂ offer was made April 13, 1984. As of that date plaintiff had accrued the following costs: filing fee, $42; service fees, $19.05; and deposition fees, $329.3 The total costs of $390.05, when added to the juryÃ¢ÂÂs verdict of $2,400, exceeds defendantsÃ¢ÂÂ section 998 offer by $35.05. Since plaintiff did obtain a more favorable judgment than the offer, the provisions of section 998, subdivision (c) will not modify the award of costs specified by section 1031.
When, as in the present case, both parties obtain judgments more favorable than their opponentsÃ¢ÂÂ section 998 offers, there is neither an augmentation or reduction of the costs normally allowed by sections 1031 and 1032. Rather, the allowance of costs is limited solely to the provisions of those sections. DefendantsÃ¢ÂÂ suggestion that the court equitably apportion the costs between the parties is contrary to the well established principle that the allowance of costs is strictly a matter of statute and is to be limited by such authority. (Williams v. Atchison etc. Ry. Co. (1909) 156 Cal. 140, 141 [103 P. 885]; Duncan v. Torney (1932) 125 Cal.App. 207, 209 [13 P.2d 765].) Since plaintiff Ã¢ÂÂprevailedÃ¢ÂÂ under section 1031 and Ã¢ÂÂobtained a more favorable judgmentÃ¢ÂÂ than defendantsÃ¢ÂÂ section 998 offer, it is clearly inappropriate to require plaintiff to pay any of defendantsÃ¢ÂÂ costs or to reduce any of the costs normally allowable to plaintiff under section 1031.
III
Finally, defendants challenge the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs decision to award specified costs for witnesses Nativo and Stresser as either excessive or entirely inappropriate.
A. Witness Nativo. Plaintiff claims $675 paid as a witness fee to Nativo for his attendance at a deposition. Plaintiff argues that Nativo, a *Supp. 12physical therapist, was listed as a defense expert and that the fee was reasonably necessary in order to take his deposition. While the entire fee was necessary as a practical matter in order to take the deposition, nevertheless it is not an allowable cost to the extent it exceeds the ordinary statutory witness fee.
The allowance of costs of depositions is generally governed by section 1032.7: Ã¢ÂÂAny person allowed costs under the provisions of this chapter shall, in addition to other costs, be entitled to the reasonable cost of taking and transcribing depositions. ...Ã¢ÂÂ  Ordinarily the allowance of costs is a matter firmly within the courtÃ¢ÂÂs discretion and any award will not be reversed absent a showing of abuse of that discretion. (County of Kern v. Ginn (1983) 146 Cal.App.3d 1107, 1113 [194 Cal.Rptr. 512].)  We find, however, that the matter of expert witness fees for attendance at a deposition is strictly limited by Government Code section 68092.5, subdivision (a): Ã¢ÂÂA person who is not a party to the action and who is required to testify before any court... or in the taking of a deposition, in any civil action or proceeding, solely as to any expert opinion which he holds . . . shall receive reasonable compensation for his entire time required to travel to and from the . . . place of taking such deposition. . . . [S]uch fees shall be paid by the party requiring such witness to attend, but such fees shall not be allowable costs or disbursements. Ã¢ÂÂ4 (Italics added.)
PlaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs reliance on section 2037.75 as authority for allowing such expenses as costs is misplaced. While that section clearly requires a party to pay a fee when taking the deposition of an opposing partyÃ¢ÂÂs expert witness, such a requirement is not consistent with Government Code, section 68092.5, subdivision (a). Unlike section 68092.5, subdivision (a), section 2037.7 contains no reference to the fee being taxable as a cost. Section 68092.5 being the more specific provision relating to allowance of expert *Supp. 13witness fees as costs, that section controls. (Rose v. State of California (1942) 19 Cal.2d 713, 723-724 [123 P.2d 505].) Accordingly, the trial court erred in allowing the $675 expert witness fee.
It is both appropriate and reasonable, however, to allow as a cost the ordinary statutory witness fee authorized by Government Code section 68093.6 (See 1 Hogan, Modern Cal. Discovery (3d ed. 1981) Oral Depositions, ÃÂ§ 2.37, p. 159.) Section 1986.5 provides that Ã¢ÂÂ[a]ny person who is subpoenaed and required to give a deposition shall be entitled to receive the same witness fees and mileage as if the subpoena required him to attend and testify before a court. ...Ã¢ÂÂ Ordinary witness fees and mileage are allowable as costs. (People v. McFarlane (1945) 71 Cal.App.2d 535 [162 P.2d 937]; People v. Bowman (1959) 173 Cal.App.2d 416 [343 P.2d 267].)
B. Witness Stresser. Stresser was a California Highway Patrol officer who investigated the accident. He was subpoenaed to trial by plaintiff. The trial court awarded $648.56 for costs incurred in connection with his appearance. Defendants argue that the fee should be limited to the statutory witness fee provided by Government Code section 68093. We disagree.
The party issuing a subpoena for a peace officer at a civil trial is required to reimburse the public entity employing the officer his salary and necessary travel expenses paid in connection with the court appearance. (Gov. Code, ÃÂ§ 68097.2.) The amount paid is a taxable cost. (Gov. Code, ÃÂ§ 68097.8.) Since we have determined that plaintiff prevailed, the entire cost of StresserÃ¢ÂÂs appearance was properly allowed.
C. Service of Process on Officer Stresser. Finally, defendants object to the claim of $30 for costs incurred by a registered process server to obtain service on Officer Stresser. Defendants contend that the fee should be limited to that allowed by Government Code, section 26721.7 Section 1032.8, subdivision (b) provides, however, that registered process servers are entitled to recover reasonable expenses in effecting service, such expenses being recoverable as costs.8 Defendants have failed to demonstrate any abuse of discretion by the trial court in awarding the costs of service.
*Supp. 14The judgment is affirmed, except as to the award of costs regarding witness Nativo. The matter is remanded to the trial court to modify the judgment in accordance with this opinion.
Garbolino, J., and Yonehiro, J.,* concurred.

All statutory references are to the Code of Civil Procedure unless otherwise indicated.


The section provides, in part: Ã¢ÂÂ(a) The costs allowed under Sections 1031 and 1032 shall be withheld or augmented as provided in this section.
Ã¢ÂÂ(b) . . . [A]ny party may serve an offer in writing upon any other party to the action to allow judgment to be taken in accordance with the terms and conditions stated at that time.
Ã¢ÂÂ(c) If an offer made by a defendant is not accepted and the plaintiff fails to obtain a more favorable judgment, the plaintiff shall not recover his costs and shall pay the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs costs from the time of the offer. In addition, in any action or proceeding other than an eminent domain action, the court, in its discretion, may require the filing of the complaint and a reasonable sum to cover costs of the services of expert witnesses, who are not regular employees of any party, actually incurred and reasonably necessary in either, or both, the preparation or trial of the case by the defendant.
Ã¢ÂÂ(d) If an offer made by a plaintiff is not accepted and the defendant fails to obtain a more favorable judgment, the court in its discretion may require the defendant to pay a reasonable sum to cover costs of the services of expert witnesses, who are not regular employees of any party, actually incurred and reasonably necessary in either, or both, the preparation or trial of the case by the plaintiff, in addition to plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs costs.
Ã¢ÂÂ(g) The costs for services of expert witnesses for trial under subdivisions (c) and (d) shall not exceed those specified in Section 68092.5 of the Government Code.Ã¢ÂÂ


Plaintiff also claimed $108 in travel expenses incurred by plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs counsel in attending an out-of-town deposition. That item was denied by the trial court in ruling on defendantsÃ¢ÂÂ motion to tax costs and is not at issue in this appeal. We note in passing, however, that such expenses incurred by an attorney have been allowed as costs, within the courtÃ¢ÂÂs discretion. (Marollo v. Ford Motor Co. (1970) 7 Cal.App.3d 84, 97-98 [86 Cal.Rptr. 526]; Hoge v. Lava Cap Gold Min. Corp. (1942) 55 Cal.App.2d 176, 188 [130 P.2d 470].)


PIaintiff argues that section 68092.5 is inapplicable since Nativo was not Ã¢ÂÂhisÃ¢ÂÂ expert witness, but rather was listed as a defense expert. The distinction is without significance. Section 68092.5 applies to the witnessÃ¢ÂÂs status as an expert without regard to who called him to testify.


Section 2037.7, subdivision (a), provides: Ã¢ÂÂAny other provision of law notwithstanding, in any case other than a workersÃ¢ÂÂ compensation case governed by the provisions of subdivision (b), any party desiring to take the deposition of a person retained as an expert by another party to the case, solely for the purpose of obtaining any expert opinion which the deponent holds upon the basis of his or her special knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, shall pay the expert a reasonable fee not exceeding his or her customary hourly or daily fee for the time reasonably and necessarily spent in connection with such deposition including time spent in travel to and from the deposition, but excluding time spent in preparation. A fee based upon the anticipated length of the deposition shall be tendered to the expert. In the event the examination and necessary cross-examination of the expert takes longer than originally anticipated, the balance of the fee due the expert shall be paid by the party who noticed the deposition within five days of receipt of an itemized statement from the expert.Ã¢ÂÂ


Ã¢ÂÂExcept as otherwise provided by law, witnessÃ¢ÂÂ fees for each dayÃ¢ÂÂs actual attendance, when legally required to attend a civil action or proceeding in the superior, municipal, and justice courts, are thirty-five dollars ($35) a day and mileage actually traveled, both ways, twenty cents ($0.20) a mile.Ã¢ÂÂ (Gov. Code, ÃÂ§ 68093.)


Ã¢ÂÂExcept as provided in this article, the fee for serving or executing any process or notice required by law or the litigants to be served is fourteen dollars ($14).Ã¢ÂÂ (Gov. Code, ÃÂ§26721.)


Section 1032.8, subdivision (b) provides: Ã¢ÂÂWhen any process is served by a registered process server . . ., the court in which the action is pending shall allow as recoverable costs such sums as are reasonably incurred in effecting service, including, but not limited to, a stakeout or other reasonable means employed in locating the person to be served.Ã¢ÂÂ

Facts
On February 27, 1984, appellant was cited by the California Highway Patrol for violating Vehicle Code section 26708, subdivision (a), in that he was operating a vehicle with its front side windows tinted. On June 1, 1984, appellant moved to dismiss on the grounds that this Vehicle Code section was unconstitutional. A hearing was held on appellantÃ¢ÂÂs motion, testimony was taken, and the trial court thereafter denied the motion. Appellant then submitted the issue of his guilt or innocence on the evidence produced during the motion, and was found guilty and sentenced to pay a fine of $25 (or in the alternative to remove the tinted material).
At the hearing the following facts were established. Appellant is a resident of the State of Arizona who had traveled into the State of California with a material affixed or applied upon the side windows of his vehicle which provided a Ã¢ÂÂtintingÃ¢ÂÂ effect. Vehicle Code section 26708, subdivision (a) makes it unlawful to drive any vehicle in California which has my material affixed to or applied to the side front windows which obstruct or reduce the driverÃ¢ÂÂs view through the windshield or side windows. The section in this *Supp. 18regard provides in pertinent part: Ã¢ÂÂ1. No person shall drive any motor vehicle with any object or material placed, displayed, installed, affixed, or applied upon the windshield or side or rear windows, [ÃÂ¶] 2. No person shall drive any motor vehicle with any object or material placed, displayed, installed, affixed, or applied in or upon the vehicle which obstructs or reduces the driverÃ¢ÂÂs clear view through the windshield or side windows.Ã¢ÂÂ
A reading of section 26708.5 of the Vehicle Code makes it clear that within the above definition of a material which Ã¢ÂÂobstructs or reduces the driverÃ¢ÂÂs clear viewÃ¢ÂÂ transparent material if it Ã¢ÂÂalters the color or reduces the light transmittance of the . . . windows.Ã¢ÂÂ Thus, Vehicle Code section 26708, subdivision (a) proscribes the operation of vehicles which have tinted side windows in California, while section 26708.5 makes it unlawful to place, install, affix or apply any transparent material reducing light transmittance. Thus, while appellant was not cited for section 26708.5, the court looked to that section as it defined material which would reduce a driverÃ¢ÂÂs vision within the meaning of section 26708, subdivision (a).
Only one witness was called for the hearing and trial, one Jay Calvin Hill. Mr. Hill was called by appellant. Respondent offered no evidence at all during the hearing and trial. Mr. Hill was accepted by the trial court as an expert in the area of window-tinting legislation, and as to safety/danger factors involved in window tinting. In this regard, Mr. Hill testified that he had been involved in window tinting for some 10 years and had assisted legislatures in 30 states with their window-tinting legislation. Some states, moreover, have actually enacted his exact draft of legislation without any change. Mr. Hill testified that appellantÃ¢ÂÂs vehicle complied with the specific requirements of the Arizona statute which permitted tinted windows with a light transmission as low as 34 percent. AppellantÃ¢ÂÂs expert further opined that testing for safety is possible with regard to window tinting. He noted that some 33 states specifically allow tinting with a light transmission as low as 32 percent, and that most other states allow it indirectly by not prohibiting tinting. Most states specify a range of light transmission for compliance while the California Vehicle Code section makes no reference to the amount of visible light transmission allowed. He defined the term Ã¢ÂÂlight transmissionÃ¢ÂÂ by percentage, to mean the percentage of visible light that is transmitted through a specimen of window tinting when the tinting is mounted on a three millimeter piece of glass. In Mr. HillÃ¢ÂÂs expert opinion the degree of light transmission determines the degree of safety, and he used samples to show the court different percentages of light transmission. In this regard, appellantÃ¢ÂÂs expert testified that a light transmission percentage as low as 34 percent would be safe for driving during the day and night and under all conditions.
*Supp. 19Finally, Mr. Hill testified that window tinting might well enhance safety since: (1) it increases the comfort of the driver, making him actually more alert and therefore safer; and (2) since tinting would reduce glare to the driver, to that extent his vision would be enhanced. Moreover, while not directly related to driving safety, tinted windows would be of benefit to citizens in that they would reduce the incidence of skin cancer, many eye diseases which are aggravated by increased glare of light, and specifically the incidence of a disease known as Lupus.

Appellant maintains that the California statute in question substantially interferes with and restricts the freedom to travel of Arizona residents, and others who may have tinted windows on their vehicles which comply with their own state statutes, and that this burden on interstate commerce is clearly excessive in relation to any local putative benefits. We are asked therefore to invalidate the statute since it is claimed to conflict with the commerce clause of the United States Constitution. Moreover, appellant likewise asserts that the California statute violates the privileges and immunities clause of the United States Constitution, since the effect of the statute impedes appellantÃ¢ÂÂs constitutional rights to travel unfettered from state to state, a basic privilege of national citizenship guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.
By its terms the commerce clause grants Congress the power Ã¢ÂÂto regulate commerce . . . among the states. . . .Ã¢ÂÂ It is well settled that even in the absence of a congressional exercise of this power, the commerce clause prevents the states from erecting barriers to the free flow of commerce. (Raymond Motor Transportation, Inc. v. Rice (1978) 434 U.S. 429 [54 L.Ed.2d 664, 98 S.Ct. 787].) At the same time, however, it has never been doubted that a state may enact legislation designed to serve a legitimate state interest such as safety or preservation of highways which, if applied *Supp. 20without discrimination against interstate commerce, may not violate the commerce clause even though it affects commerce.
Both appellant and the state concede that a balancing test has been used by the courts to evaluate state statutes facing a commerce clause challenge. (Southern Pacific Company v. Arizona (1945) 325 U.S. 761, 775-776 [89 L.Ed. 1915, 1928, 65 S.Ct. 1515, 1523], Raymond Motors Transportation, Inc. v. Rice, supra, 434 U.S. 429; Bibb v. Navajo Freightlines, Inc. (1959) 359 U.S. 520 [3 L.Ed.2d 1003, 79 S.Ct. 962].) This weighted balancing test has been referred to as a Ã¢ÂÂprocess of delicate adjustment,Ã¢ÂÂ and although courts have used various tests to express the distinction between permissible and impermissible impact on interstate commerce, the most recent decisions have made it clear that the inquiry necessarily involves a sensitive consideration of the weight and nature of the state regulatory concern weighed against the burden imposed on the course of interstate commerce. As the court stated in Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc. (1970) 397 U.S. 137 [25 L.Ed.2d 174, 90 S.Ct. 844]: Ã¢ÂÂ. . . [w]here the statute regulates evenhandedly to effectuate a legitimate local public interest, and its effects on interstate commerce are only incidental, it will be upheld unless the burden imposed on such commerce is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits.Ã¢ÂÂ (P. 142 [25 L.Ed.2d p. 178].) Where there is a legitimate local purpose Ã¢ÂÂthen the question becomes one of degree and the extent of the burden that will be tolerated will of course, depend on the nature of the local interest involved, and on whether it could be promoted as well with a lesser impact on interstate activities.Ã¢ÂÂ (Ibid.)
The state thus argues that on the whole record we must conclude that the total effect of the law as a safety measure outweighs any burden it may have on interstate commerce and cites Raymond Motors Transportation, Inc. v. Rice, supra, 434 U.S. 429, for the proposition that Ã¢ÂÂthose who would challenge regulations said to promote highway safety must overcome a strong presumption of their validity.Ã¢ÂÂ (Accord Bibb v. Navajo Freightlines, supra, 359 U.S. 520.) The state, moreover, reminds us of the language of Southern Pacific Co. v. Arizona, supra, 325 U.S. 761, where the court adopted the principle that Ã¢ÂÂunless we can conclude on the whole record that the total effect of the law as a safety measure in reducing accidents and casualties is so slight or problematical as not to outweigh the national interest in keeping interstate commerce free from interferences which seriously impede it . . . we must uphold the statute.Ã¢ÂÂ
We, of course, acknowledge that this court must be guided by the foregoing principles and that we must engage in a Ã¢ÂÂdelicate weighing and balancing processÃ¢ÂÂ in testing the validity of the California legislation.
*Supp. 21Turning first to the question of whether or not the particular Vehicle Code even promotes safety, we note that the state, for reasons unexplained, made no effort to produce any evidence that the California statute promoted highway safety, nor, indeed, to contradict appellantÃ¢ÂÂs evidence that window tinting may actually enhance highway safety and promote better health for its citizens by reducing eye disease and the malady referred to as Lupus. The state now urges this court, however, to presume that the California LegislatureÃ¢ÂÂs judgment (concerning whether highway safety is promoted by the stateÃ¢ÂÂs statute) is supported by facts known to the Legislature, unless facts are proved which preclude that possibility. The state therefore asserts that since nothing in the record precludes that possibility here, that the legislative judgment was supported by facts known to the Legislature, and hence we should presume the statuteÃ¢ÂÂs validity. The state cites to us South Carolina State Highway Dept. v. Barnwell Bros. (1938) 303 U.S. 177 [82 L.Ed. 734, 58 S.Ct. 510], for this proposition. However, in that case, not only did the record exclude that possibility, it showed affirmatively that there was adequate support for the legislative judgment regarding the statute in question (namely weight and size limitations of motor trucks). Moreover, although we accept the general principle announced in the case, our inquiry does not end with the assumption that the legislative action was based upon facts presumed to support the enacted statute. The courts are, nevertheless, free to determine whether or not the statute is reasonable, and whether or not on the whole record the burden on interstate commerce exceeds or outweighs the benefits to be gained by the state as a safety measure.
With the above principles in mind, we examine the record in the trial court. First, there was testimony that some 33 states have passed legislation allowing after-market films to be affixed to vehicles with a light transmission of 32 percent or higher. Most of these states, as conceded by respondent, have based their actions on testing which has shown that after-market tinting with a 32 percent or higher light transmission is in fact safe. Testing included the driving of such vehicles equipped with after-market tinting at different light transmission percentages, at different times of the day or night, and in different terrain and locales. Moreover, these tests were conducted by trained and experienced personnel, and by various law enforcement and regulatory agencies. Finally, there was evidence that hearings had been conducted by the American Association of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers (A.A.M.V.A.) a federally chartered body, and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration regarding whether there was any evidence of safety-related or vehicle-tinting-related accidents and that those bodies found no evidence of any vehicle accidents attributable to window tinting.
In the instant case, appellant does not dispute that the state has a legitimate interest in regulating vehicles in order to promote highway safety. He ar*Supp. 22gues, however, that the burden imposed on interstate commerce here is, in the language of Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., supra, 397 U.S. 137, 142 [25 L.Ed.2d 174, 178] Ã¢ÂÂclearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits.Ã¢ÂÂ Here there was no evidence of any putative local benefits since the statute was shown by uncontradicted evidence to make no contribution to highway safety, or at best an extremely minimal contribution as it might prevent the operation of vehicles having less than the minimum light transmission standards acknowledged to be safe as those standards have been adopted by at least 33 states. What enforcement of the California statute does is to prevent the operation of vehicles with window tinting installed which meet the minimum standards of these 33 other states, as well as of vehicles from most other states with tinting having no statute prohibiting such materials. Thus, there has been no showing that this statute contributes to highway safety, although it is clear that the burden on interstate commerce is substantial. In this regard, it is obvious that any individual wishing to bring his vehicle, equipped with after-market tinting legal in his state into California has but two choices: (1) do not travel into California at all; or (2) remove the tinting. While there was no direct evidence of the actual expense or delay in removing such material from a vehicle, it is obvious that such removal and reinstallation when the driver returns to his home state can not be said to be insubstantial.
As we have shown appellant has produced credible and virtually uncontradicted evidence to disprove the stateÃ¢ÂÂs assertion that the statute makes any meaningful contribution to highway safety, and the state for its part has virtually defaulted in its defense of the statute as a safety measure. The statute is thus unconstitutional as it unduly burdens interstate commerce.
Since we have decided this case on the basis that the statute unduly bur- - dens interstate commerce, we need not address the question of whether or not the statute violates the privileges and immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment as claimed by appellant. The judgment of the justice court is therefore reversed.'

*Supp. 3Opinion
HAMRICK, Acting P. J.
The plaintiff appeals from a municipal court judgment holding that the defendant, a condominium owner who is a member of the homeowners association and who has accepted the covenants, conditions and restrictions pertaining to his condominium has no personal liability for his share of maintenance assessments levied by the association after he vacates his condominium.
Facts of the Case
On November 29, 1974, a declaration of covenants, conditions and restrictions (CC&Rs) of Cerro de Alcala was filed in the county recorderÃ¢ÂÂs office for the County of San Diego. On or about February 2, 1982, respondent, Harry Burns, agreed to purchase a Cerro de Alcala condominium unit. According to the escrow instructions respondent agreed to become a member of the homeowners association and be bound by the CC&Rs. Respondent received and accepted a deed to the condominium unit and personally received and signed for the subject CC&Rs which expressly provide in part as follows: Ã¢ÂÂ. . .by acceptance of a deed for a unit herein . . . each owner will promptly pay in full all dues, fees and assessments . . . .Ã¢ÂÂ
After close of escrow respondent took possession of his condominium unit and remained in possession for five and one-half months. While respondent occupied his condominium, he paid to the homeowners association his share of assessments which were levied against his condominium unit. However, on August 4, 1982, respondent vacated his condominium unit after the holder of the first trust deed note, Home Federal Savings, notified respondent that it was enforcing the Ã¢ÂÂdue on sale clauseÃ¢ÂÂ and would be commencing foreclosure proceedings. Respondent remained the record title owner of the condominium unit until November 10, 1983, when title was transferred pursuant to foreclosure by a trusteeÃ¢ÂÂs deed. Respondent did not pay any assessment fees levied against his condominium from August 1982, through November 1983, which amount, after certain credits, was stipulated to be $1,265.02.
The municipal court found that respondent was not personally liable for the assessments as he had ceased enjoying the benefits of the condominium when he vacated same.
Discussion
Civil Code section 1466 provides in part that Ã¢ÂÂ[n]o one, merely by reason of having acquired an estate subject to a covenant running with the *Supp. 4land, is liable for a breach of the covenant . . . after he has parted with it or ceased to enjoy its benefits.Ã¢ÂÂ
It is undisputed that the maintenance assessments are in fact covenants running with the land as the CC&Rs include a provision that each homeowner was to pay his or her proportionate share of maintenance fees. The intent that the Cerro de Alcala covenants were to run with the land was expressly manifested in the deed through which Burns acquired title. Further, maintenance assessments Ã¢ÂÂtouch and concern the landÃ¢ÂÂ as the payments go directly to the maintenance of the grounds and the making of necessary repairs. Finally, the covenants specifically bound all successors without distinction as to how the property is acquired.
Respondent, however, asserts that because he Ã¢ÂÂvacatedÃ¢ÂÂ the premises in August 1982, after being advised of foreclosure proceedings, Civil Code section 1466 was triggered, releasing him of any further liability. Thus, the key issue is whether a vacating of the premises constitutes either a parting or ceasing of enjoyment of the property (as described in Civ. Code, ÃÂ§ 1466).
We hold that it does not. Abandonment of a right or property is the voluntary relinquishment thereof by its owner with the intention of terminating his ownership, possession and control and without vesting ownership in another person. (Carden v. Carden (1959) 167 Cal.App.2d 202, 209 [334 P.2d 87].) In the present case, there simply is no showing of such intent. In order for an owner to abandon a unit in a community association so as to divest himself of the duty to pay assessments, the owner must give the association record notice of the abandonment through the recording of a quitclaim deed, notice of abandonment or other recorded instrument which makes it clear that the owner is relinquishing all of the rights of ownership. Thus, vacating of the premises (mere relinquishment of possession) does not release a homeowner of liability arising from maintenance assessments becoming due.
Although respondent ceased to enjoy the possession of his property, he continued to enjoy other aspects of ownership until the very moment of recordation of the trusteeÃ¢ÂÂs deed which effected a transfer of the property. As the record owner of the property, respondent continued to benefit from the homeowners associationÃ¢ÂÂs ongoing schedule of maintenance and repairs to the common areas. In addition, respondent benefited from the protection of a policy of general liability insurance maintained by the homeowners association. Also, at all times prior to the transfer of title, respondent was entitled to lease, encumber, assign, exchange or sell the property as well as *Supp. 5reoccupy the unit at no expense. Thus, it is clear that respondent did not cease to enjoy the benefits of the estate by voluntarily vacating the premises.
It should be noted that Civil Code section 1356, which gives the homeowners association the right to collect assessments made in conformity with their CC&Rs specifically makes this obligation a Ã¢ÂÂdebt of the ownerÃ¢ÂÂ at the time the assessment is made. Therefore, such obligation is personal in nature, even though it may also become a lien against the property under circumstances as provided in that code section.
RespondentÃ¢ÂÂs final contention is that Code of Civil Procedure section 580b precludes a deficiency judgment after a sale of real property for failure of the purchaser to complete his contract of sale. This code section has no application to the instant case as this is not an action for deficiency pursuant to a default of a purchase price. Rather this is an action arising from an independent covenant. Unlike the first trust deed holder, the homeowners association is not a party to the sale transaction, nor is the association a lender of funds. In addition, a homeowners association does not have the ability to demand security from the buyer and the association must accept the buyer and cannot avoid the transaction. Therefore, the association is not a member of the class intended to be affected by the transactions covered by Code of Civil Procedure section 580b, nor are the protections afforded by Code of Civil Procedure section 580b intended to defeat the interest of the homeowners associations.
Based on the foregoing we hold that an owner of a condominium unit and a member of the homeowners association retains substantial benefits of ownership notwithstanding the relinquishment of physical possession of the condominium unit and may not avoid payment of maintenance assessments levied pursuant to CC&Rs accepted by the owner merely by physically removing himself from the property.
Accordingly, judgment of the lower court is reversed with instructions to enter judgment in favor of plaintiff/appellant, Cerro de Alcala Homeowners Association, in the stipulated amount of $1,865.02, less a $600 credit for a net amount of $1,265.02.

Opinion
BERNSTEIN, J.
Defendant Roman Alberto Gerardo was charged in a misdemeanor complaint with a violation of section 9.16.053 of the City of *Supp. 4Commerce Municipal Code (hereafter section 9.16.053), which prohibits the carrying of knives or dirks in plain view.1 Specifically, Los Angeles County Sheriff Department complaint report, No. 184-07639-0242-152, alleges that two sheriffÃ¢ÂÂs deputies were patrolling Whittier Boulevard on a crowded and dangerous Ã¢ÂÂcruise nightÃ¢ÂÂ on May 28, 1984, at 1:10 a.m. The deputies saw defendant, a member of the El Sereno gang, wearing a hunting knife with a six-inch blade on his belt.
On July 19, 1984, defendant filed a written demurrer to the complaint on the ground that the latter failed to allege a public offense. (Pen. Code, ÃÂ§ 1004, subd. 4.) Defendant took the position that section 9.16.053 is invalid for the dual reasons that its proscription against carrying knives or dirks in plain view is in direct conflict with state law and that the state has impliedly preempted the field of knife, dirk, and dagger regulation.
With regard to his first reason, defendant pointed out that in enacting Penal Code section 12020, which proscribes the carrying of any dirk or dagger upon the person, inter alia, the Legislature expressly exempted Ã¢ÂÂ[k]nives carried in sheaths which are worn openly suspended from the waist of the wearerÃ¢ÂÂ from being considered to be Ã¢ÂÂconcealed within the meaning of this section.Ã¢ÂÂ (Pen. Code, ÃÂ§ 12020, subd. (e).) Defendant also pointed out that Ã¢ÂÂknives which are carried openly in sheaths suspended from the waist of the wearerÃ¢ÂÂ are likewise excluded from the proscription in Penal Code section 12025 against the carrying of a weapon concealed within a vehicle or upon the person of someone who has no license to carry it. (Pen. Code, ÃÂ§ 12025, subd. (c).)
With regard to the second reason, defendant argued that since the Legislature has formulated a broad and comprehensive scheme of regulating the possession and carrying of dangerous weapons, including dirks and daggers, the Legislature clearly intended to preempt the field and thus preclude local *Supp. 5regulation of such matters, such as section 9.16.053. In support, defendant referred to the fact that Ã¢ÂÂTitle 2 of Part 4 of the Penal Code, in which the LegislatureÃ¢ÂÂs prohibition [against] concealed possession of dirks and daggers is found (Pen. Code, ÃÂ§ 12020, subd. (a)), is not merely concerned with knives, but is entitled Ã¢ÂÂThe Dangerous Weapons Control LawÃ¢ÂÂ (Pen. Code, ÃÂ§ 12000).Ã¢ÂÂ In particular, he referred to the provisions in that part which regulate Ã¢ÂÂthe manufacture, sale and possession of blackjacks, metal knuckles, explosives, sawed-off shotguns, dirks and daggers (Pen. Code, ÃÂ§[ÃÂ§] 12020, 12025), the carrying of loaded weapons (Pen. Code, ÃÂ§ 12031), and the licensing and sale of concealed weapons (Pen. Code, ÃÂ§[ÃÂ§] 12050-12079).Ã¢ÂÂ
On August 16, 1984, a hearing was held on the demurrer. The People argued that section 9.16.053, which proscribes the carrying of knives or dirks in plain view, does not conflict with Penal Code section 12020 since the latter only covers concealed weapons. In support they cited the court to Yuen v. Municipal Court (1975) 52 Cal.App.3d 351 [125 Cal.Rptr. 87]. The defense reiterated their arguments on state preemption and conflict with state law. The defense also argued that defendant had a constitutional right Ã¢ÂÂto bear arms,Ã¢ÂÂ and thus section 9.16.053 was an abridgment of that right. The People then argued that no state preemption was involved since the state Legislature did not address itself to the regulation of unconcealed knives.
In sustaining the demurrer the court expressly found Ã¢ÂÂthat based on defenseÃ¢ÂÂs written motion and oral arguments . . . [the] [S]tate has pre-empted [the] field dealing with dangerous weapons, so the ordinance [is] in conflict with [s]tate [l]aw.Ã¢ÂÂ The court then dismissed the case on its own motion.
On appeal the People assert that the court erred in sustaining the demurrer. We agree and reverse.
Initially, we must preface our discussion of the matters raised in defendantÃ¢ÂÂs demurrer by acknowledging that the ordinance in question is invalid to the extent that it defines Ã¢ÂÂknives and daggersÃ¢ÂÂ to include Ã¢ÂÂany spring-blade, switch-blade or snap-blade knife; any locking-blade knife; any knife any blade of which is automatically released by a spring mechanism or other mechanical device.Ã¢ÂÂ (City of Commerce Mun. Code, ÃÂ§ 9.16.051.)
Article XI, section 7 of the California Constitution provides, Ã¢ÂÂA county or city may make and enforce within its limits all local, police, sanitary and other ordinances and regulations not in conflict with general laws.Ã¢ÂÂ
From our review of Penal Code section 653k and its legislative history we conclude that the Legislature intended to except these particular types *Supp. 6of knives from local regulation, and thus the City of Commerce ordinanceÃ¢ÂÂs attempt to proscribe such knives directly conflicts with state law covering the same subject matter.
When enacted in 1957, Penal Code section 653k declared it to be a misdemeanor for anyone to carry concealed upon his person a switch-blade knife having a blade over two inches in length. However, in 1959, the Legislature caused the word Ã¢ÂÂconcealedÃ¢ÂÂ to be deleted, thus expressing its intent to proscribe such switch-blades whether they were concealed or in plain view. Subsequently, that section was again amended to broaden further the kinds of knives the Legislature intended to fall within the scope of section 653k, which, as amended in 1981, and as it currently stands, provides: Ã¢ÂÂEvery person who carries upon his person, and every person who sells, offers for sale, exposes for sale, loans, transfers, or gives to any other person a switch-blade knife having a blade over two inches in length is guilty of a misdemeanor, [f] For the purposes of this section a Ã¢ÂÂswitchblade knifeÃ¢ÂÂ is a knife having the appearance of a pocketknife, and shall include a spring-blade knife, snapblade knife, gravity knife or any other similar type knife, the blade or blades of which are two or more inches long and which can be released automatically by a flick of a button, pressure on the handle, flip of the wrist or other mechanical device, or is released by the weight of the blade or by any type of mechanism whatsoever.Ã¢ÂÂ
This invalidity, however, is of no avail to defendant. He was not charged with carrying or wearing a Ã¢ÂÂswitch-bladeÃ¢ÂÂ or similar type of knife. We find this invalid portion to be severable from the remainder of the ordinance.
Ã¢ÂÂIt is a general rule supported by an unbroken line of decisions that a provision in, or a part of, an act may be unconstitutional without invalidating the entire act. The accepted doctrine in such case is that the constitutional portions of a statute may stand alone and remain in force, if they can be separated from the portions that are void. In other words, the valid portions of a statute will be upheld if they are severable from the invalid portions and constitute a completely operative expression of the legislative intent. . . .
Ã¢ÂÂThe constitutional and unconstitutional provisions of a statute may be included in one and the same section and yet be severable. Also, statutes may be unconstitutional and void as to their application to a part of the subject matter and valid as to other parts; legislation may also be constitutional in operation with respect to some persons and states of fact and unconstitutional as to others.
*Supp. 76<
Ã¢ÂÂThe rules as to partial unconstitutionality apply with the same force to county and city ordinances and city charters as to legislative acts generally.
Ã¢ÂÂA court will not consider the asserted unconstitutionality of portions of an act that do not affect the rights of the party raising the question, where such portions, if unconstitutional, would fall without affecting the validity of the remainder of the statute.Ã¢ÂÂ (13 Cal.Jur.3d, Constitutional Law, ÃÂ§ 84, pp. 152-153, fns. omitted.)
Having thus disposed of these preliminary matters, we turn now to the validity of the City of Commerce Municipal CodeÃ¢ÂÂs proscription against the carrying of knives or daggers in plain view on the person in the context of defendantÃ¢ÂÂs demurrer and the complaint against him.
We find no merit in defendantÃ¢ÂÂs contention that section 9.16.053 conflicts with state law. Penal Code sections 12020 and 12025 only prohibit the carrying of concealed dirks and daggers and expressly exclude from their purview Ã¢ÂÂknives which are carried or worn openly suspended in sheaths from the waist of the wearer.Ã¢ÂÂ It is therefore abundantly clear that section 9.16.053Ã¢ÂÂs proscription is entirely different from and in no way touches upon the proscriptions covered by those Penal Code sections.
From our analysis, post, we conclude that defendantÃ¢ÂÂs remaining ground is also without merit. Local regulation of knives, dirks, or daggers carried or worn in plain view has not been precluded by virtue of state preemption of the field. Accordingly, section 9.16.053 is not invalid as a usurpation of the stateÃ¢ÂÂs prerogative in that area.
In reaching this latter conclusion we are not unmindful of our earlier decision in People v. Bass (1963) 225 Cal.App.2d Supp. 777 [33 Cal.Rptr. 365], or the fact that the Bass decision was mentioned in footnote 5 in Galvan v. Superior Court (1969) 70 Cal.2d 851, 862 [76 Cal.Rptr. 642, 452 P.2d 930] as holding: Ã¢ÂÂthe state has preempted the field of knife-like weapons.Ã¢ÂÂ
In Bass, 225 Cal.App.2d Supp. 777, the defendant was prosecuted for carrying a concealed knife with a blade at least three inches long. The local ordinance in that case purported to prohibit the wearing or carrying of any dirk or dagger, or any knife with a blade three inches or more in length, inter alia, concealed upon the person. (Pp. 778-779.) We invalidated the ordinance on state preemption grounds after finding that Ã¢ÂÂthe Legislature has determined by implication that such conduct shall not be criminal in this *Supp. 8state.Ã¢ÂÂ (P. 782.) We reasoned that the Legislature intended to preempt the field based on its enactment of the Ã¢ÂÂDangerous WeaponsÃ¢ÂÂ Control LawÃ¢ÂÂ (Pen. Code, ÃÂ§ÃÂ§ 12000-12520) and Penal Code section 653k, which prohibits the carrying of a switch-blade knife having a blade over two inches in length concealed upon the person. We concluded that: Ã¢ÂÂ[T]he Legislature, having prohibited the carrying of dirks, daggers, and switchblade knives, has not only itself forbidden one to carry the knife possessed by defendant, but has shut off the power of the city to forbid it.Ã¢ÂÂ (Ibid.)
In Bass we relied upon In re Lane (1962) 58 Cal.2d 99 [22 Cal.Rptr. 857, 372 P.2d 897] wherein a local ordinance, making sexual intercourse between unmarried people a crime, was declared invalid because the field of what constituted a sexual offense was preempted by the general laws. Lane, in supporting its opinion, cited approximately a page and one-half of cases dealing with sexual offenses. The exhaustive enumeration of sexual offenses by the Legislature led the Lane court to hold that by implication the conduct proscribed by the county ordinance was not to be considered criminal. It was preemption by implication and the Bass court interpreted the Lane holding to mean that anything not specifically denominated as illegal by the Legislature was therefore legal notwithstanding any county ordinance to the contrary. Bass is an example of the doctrine of preemption by implication gone wild, for when it comes to the open possession of knives, the Legislature continues to be almost completely silent.
Penal Code section 12000 et seq., otherwise known as the Dangerous Weapons Control Law, never mentions a knife. Penal Code section 12020 does prohibit the concealed carrying of any Ã¢ÂÂdirk or dagger.Ã¢ÂÂ The total failure of the Legislature to address itself to the problem of knives as weapons has resulted in a whole line of cases wherein the courts were compelled to call ordinary kitchen knives and carving knives, and other knife-like weapons capable of inflicting mortal wounds, Ã¢ÂÂdirks and daggers.Ã¢ÂÂ People v. Ferguson (1970) 7 Cal.App.3d 13, 19-20 [86 Cal.Rptr. 383]; People v. Forrest (1967) 67 Cal.2d 478 [62 Cal.Rptr. 766, 432 P.2d 374]; People v. Cabral (1975) 51 Cal.App.3d 707 [124 Cal.Rptr. 418]; People v. Villagren (1980) 106 Cal.ÃÂpp.3d 720 [165 Cal.Rptr. 470]. The aforementioned cases are but a sample of the struggle courts and juries have had turning knives into Ã¢ÂÂdirks or daggersÃ¢ÂÂ in order to protect citizens from those who carry death-dealing weapons. Indeed the Legislature has never dealt with the knife genre, but only with specifically designated weapons designed for stabbing, i.e., dirk, dagger, switch-blade. (In all fairness, the knife did get mentioned in 1974 with the passage of Pen. Code, ÃÂ§ 626.10, which made it illegal to bring or possess any knife having a blade longer than three and one-half inches onto the grounds of or within any public school.)
*Supp. 9Subsequent to the decision in Bass, we were provided with a set of criteria for determining the question of preemption in In re Hubbard (1964) 62 Cal.2d 119, 128 [41 Cal.Rptr. 393, 396 P.2d 809]. The three criteria in Hubbard were as follows: Ã¢ÂÂ(1) [T]he subject matter has been so fully and completely covered by general law as to clearly indicate that it has become exclusively a matter of state concern; (2) the subject matter has been partially covered by general law couched in such terms as to indicate clearly that a paramount state concern will not tolerate further or additional local action; or (3) the subject matter has been partially covered by general law, and the subject is of such a nature that the adverse effect of a local ordinance on the transient citizens of the state outweighs the possible benefit to the municipality.Ã¢ÂÂ (At p. 128.)
Applying the criteria set forth in Hubbard, it is clear that the subject matter, i.e., carrying and possession of knives, has not been fully and completely covered by general law so as to indicate that it is a matter exclusively of state concern. As to the second criteria, the subject matter of knives as a classification cannot even be considered partially covered by general law and there is nothing to indicate that regulation in the area of knives is of such paramount state concern that additional local action cannot be tolerated. The third criteria requires an analysis of whether the ordinancesÃ¢ÂÂ prohibition on the carrying of knives and daggers in plain view would work such a hardship on transient citizens that it outweighs any benefit to the municipality. What is the hardship that the ordinance imposes upon a transient? It is that he cannot come into the county carrying knives or daggers in plain view unless he can demonstrate that those implements are essential to a recognized religious practice or are to be used in a lawful occupation or for the purpose of lawful recreation. This court finds no adverse effect on the transient citizen other than being required to justify the possession of the proscribed dangerous weapons. Certainly the benefit to the municipality far outweighs the inconvenience to the transient citizen.
Thus, this court finds that under the criteria delineated in In re Hubbard, supra, 62 Cal.2d 119, the subject of the open possession of knives has not been preempted by the Legislature.
In Yuen v. Municipal Court (1975) 52 Cal.App.3d 351 [125 Cal.Rptr. 87] a municipal ordinance made it an offense to loiter while carrying a concealed weapon. The court held that the local ordinance was not preempted by either the state law governing vagrancy or the state law governing the possession of knives. Although the court in Yuen did distinguish the ordinance it dealt with from the ordinance dealt with in Bass, it nevertheless did analyze the question of preemption and at page 356 it said: Ã¢ÂÂWe next examine whether the Legislature has pre-empted the control of knives and *Supp. 10knife-like objects as dangerous or deadly weapons.Ã¢ÂÂ Its examination came up negative on the question of state preemption in the field of control of knives.
Under Auto Equity Sales, Inc. v. Superior Court (1962) 57 Cal.2d 450, 456 [20 Cal.Rptr. 321, 369 P.2d 937], this court is not compelled by the rule of stare decisis to follow the holding in Bass, supra, 225 Cal.App.2d Supp. 777. Furthermore, it finds that footnote 5 in Galvan, supra, 70 Cal.2d at p. 862, is by no means a clear approval of the holding in Bass; if anything it is equivocal, and equivocal dictum at best.
The order of dismissal is reversed with directions to vacate the order sustaining defendantÃ¢ÂÂs demurrer and to substitute therefor an order overruling the demurrer.
Cooperman, P. J., concurred.

 The following sections of the City of Commerce Municipal Code, drawn from ordinance No. 345, section 2 (1984), delineate its prohibition on carrying knives or daggers in plain view:
Ã¢ÂÂ9.16.051 Knives and daggers defined. As used in this chapter, the terms Ã¢ÂÂknives and daggersÃ¢ÂÂ shall include any knife, dirk or dagger having a blade of three inches or more in length; any spring-blade, switch-blade or snap-blade knife; any locking-blade knife; any knife any blade of which is automatically released by a spring mechanism or other mechanical device; any ice pick or similar sharp stabbing tool; any straight-edge razor or any razor blade fitted to a handle.
Ã¢ÂÂ9.16.053 Carrying knives and daggers in plain view prohibited. It is unlawful for any person to carry on his person, in plain view, any knife or dagger.
Ã¢ÂÂ9.16.054 Exceptions to applicability. The provisions of Sections 9.16.051 through 9.16.053 shall not be deemed to prohibit the carrying of ordinary tools or equipment for use in a lawful occupation or for the purpose of lawful recreation, or where the carrying of a knife or dagger is a recognized religious practice.Ã¢ÂÂ

FREDMAN, J.
Earl Chris Laursen (defendant) appeals from his conviction by a jury of violation of Vehicle Code sections 23101 (reckless driving) and 20002, subdivision (a) (hit-run, property damage), in the San Luis Ob-ispo County Municipal Court.
Defendant and the asserted victims, Amador Rubio, father, and Mark Rubio, son, had been involved in a dispute regarding defendantÃ¢ÂÂs right to access to an easement for a water well and its associated equipment. The dispute was the subject of a civil action between the defendant and the Rubios. On April 1, 1984, defendant drove a Ford Ranchero vehicle to the site. A verbal altercation developed between him and Amador Rubio. Ama-dor Rubio told the defendant not to leave, that his son had gone to call the sheriff.
The defendant started his car and backed into Mark RubioÃ¢ÂÂs Volkswagen, parked a few feet away. The Ranchero then accelerated forward, striking *Supp. 3Amador RubioÃ¢ÂÂs Volkswagen, parked about 10 to 15 feet in front of defendant. After striking both vehicles, the defendant left at a rapid rate of speed. He neither reported the incident to any law enforcement agency, nor left any means of identifying himself with either of the Rubios as required by Vehicle Code section 20002, subdivision (a). The defendant was charged with, and acquitted of, Penal Code section 245, subdivision (a)Ã¢ÂÂassault with a deadly weapon.

IV.

Was There an Ã¢ÂÂAccidentÃ¢ÂÂ Within the Meaning of Vehicle Code Section 20002, Subdivision (a)?

Defendant contends that an Ã¢ÂÂaccidentÃ¢ÂÂ did not occur within the meaning and intent of Vehicle Code section 20002, subdivision (a).1 He claims that an Ã¢ÂÂaccident,Ã¢ÂÂ by definition, cannot be the result of an intended act. The property damage inflicted here being purposeful on defendantÃ¢ÂÂs part, he claims that application of the statute to include intentional acts renders the section unconstitutionally vague.
At trial, defendant admitted that he Ã¢ÂÂpushedÃ¢ÂÂ one Rubio vehicle back some distance and struck the other, while clearing his own vehicle to effect an Ã¢ÂÂescapeÃ¢ÂÂ from the wrath of the Rubios. Amador Rubio had to jump from the path of defendantÃ¢ÂÂs vehicle to avoid being run down.
*Supp. 4The Legislature has not defined the term Ã¢ÂÂaccidentÃ¢ÂÂ in its Vehicle Code context. Prior to 1965, the section read: Ã¢ÂÂ(a) The driver of any vehicle which collides with any vehicle which is unattended, etc. ...Ã¢ÂÂ (Italics added.) Without explanation Statutes 1965, chapter 872, section 3, amended the section to read: Ã¢ÂÂ(a) The driver of any vehicle involved in an accident resulting in damage, etc. . . .Ã¢ÂÂ (Italics added.) This amendment conformed the property damage statute to those relating to injury and death. The requirement that the Ã¢ÂÂvictimÃ¢ÂÂ vehicle be unattended has been eliminated.
Dictionary sources have defined the word Ã¢ÂÂaccidentÃ¢ÂÂ in relation to its several general meanings.2
People v. Green (1950) 96 Cal.App.2d 283 [215 P.2d 127], cited by defendant, decided the issue of whether or not the injury to a passenger who jumped from a vehicle triggered the mandatory reporting requirements of then section 482, subdivision (a), a predecessor reporting statute.
The court in Green took a broad view of the meaning of the statute, holding that the injuries to the victim required application of the mandatory assistance provisions and that an Ã¢ÂÂaccidentÃ¢ÂÂ in fact occurred within the meaning of the Vehicle Code provisions. The Green court relied on People v. Kinney (1938) 28 Cal.App.2d 232, 237 [82 P.2d 203], another case involving injury to a passenger. The court there stated: Ã¢ÂÂIt is asserted that section 482 of the Vehicle Code does not require the rendering of assistance to one who is injured by an automobile unless the accident occurs by striking a pedestrian or injuring the driver or occupant of another vehicle with which the machine collides. In other words, it is claimed the statute does not require the driver of an automobile who is involved in a casualty other than *Supp. 5a collision or the striking of a pedestrian to render assistance to a person who is injured while riding in his machine as a guest. We are of the opinion that is too narrow a construction of the statute in question. That limitation of the application of section 482 of the Vehicle Code would defeat, to a substantial extent, the very purpose for which it was enacted. The statute evidently was intended to require the furnishing of information by the driver of any vehicle involved in an automobile accident of any kind in which another person is injured, so as to identify the driver and fix the responsibility therefor on the culpable party.Ã¢ÂÂ (Italics added.)
The appellate courts of other jurisdictions have addressed the same issue as presently faces us.
In State v. Smyth (1979) 121 R.I. 188 [397 A.2d 497], the Supreme Court of Rhode Island posited the issueÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂWe are asked to decide whether a defendant who intentionally drives his truck into the rear of an automobile, causing personal injury to the occupants of that automobile, and then departs the scene without identifying himself or rendering aid, can be convicted of leaving the scene of an accident under GL 1956 (1968 Reenactment) ÃÂ§ 31-26-1.Ã¢ÂÂ For the purpose of this discussion, the provisions of the Rhode Island statute are akin to the California section under scrutiny.
The Rhode Island court reviewed the literature and case precedents defining the word Ã¢ÂÂaccidentÃ¢ÂÂ in various contextsÃ¢ÂÂworkersÃ¢ÂÂ compensation, insurance policies, and penal statutes, etc.
The court reasoned, in reaching its conclusion, that the statuteÃ¢ÂÂs reporting requirements should not depend solely on the mental state of the actor involved in a vehicular collision. Ã¢ÂÂFrom the viewpoint of the perpetrator of an intentional act, the act is surely not an accident within the more common definition of the term. But from the perspective of the injured victim, the primary beneficiary of the statute, he or she has been involved in an accident and needs the same protections afforded other highway casualties. Therefore, we believe that the legislature intended the term Ã¢ÂÂaccidentÃ¢ÂÂ to include all automobile highway collisionsÃ¢ÂÂintentional as well as unintentionalÃ¢ÂÂ where personal injury occurs.Ã¢ÂÂ
In State v. Liuafi (1981) 1 Hawaii App. 625 [623 P.2d 1271], the Intermediate Court of Appeals of Hawaii dealt with a similar issue. The defendant was convicted of attempted murder and of failure to render assistance to a person injured in an Ã¢ÂÂaccident.Ã¢ÂÂ He asserted that his conviction of attempted murder by vehicle precluded conviction for failing to render assistance. The attempted murder involved a volitional act on his part, and *Supp. 6such an act did not come within the intended legislative meaning when defining the duties of a driver in an Ã¢ÂÂaccident.Ã¢ÂÂ
The Hawaii court relied primarily on dictionary definitions of the term Ã¢ÂÂaccident,Ã¢ÂÂ and concluded that the use of that word in the statute excluded the events which transpired in the case before them. They affirmed the attempted murder conviction and vacated the judgment for failing to render assistance.
More recently, the Supreme Court of Oregon was called upon to decide a similar issue in State v. Parker (1985) 299 Ore. 534 [704 P.2d 1144], affirming the decision of the Oregon Court of Appeals (1984) 70 Ore.App. 397 [689 P.2d 1035]. The facts involved a defendant charged with intentional damage of anotherÃ¢ÂÂs motor vehicle and with failure to report the Ã¢ÂÂaccident.Ã¢ÂÂ The defendant claimed, as does defendant here, that his failure to report the Ã¢ÂÂaccidentÃ¢ÂÂ was inconsistent with the initial criminal mischief charge, and that the former pleading was demurrable. The Oregon and California statutes are basically similar regarding reporting requirements after an Ã¢ÂÂaccident.Ã¢ÂÂ
The Oregon court noted the Liuafi decision and rejected its reasoning, saying, Ã¢ÂÂWhen taken in its natural and obvious sense, Ã¢ÂÂaccidentÃ¢ÂÂ can mean Ã¢ÂÂif happening wholly or partly through human agency, an event which under the circumstances is unusual and unexpected by the person to whom it happens.Ã¢ÂÂ BlackÃ¢ÂÂs Law Dictionary, supra.3 This sense of the word harmonizes well with the purpose for enacting the statute which was to establish a comprehensive body of law covering all aspects of traffic on Oregon highways. . . . From this all-encompassing perspective, it seems logical that the legislature would intend to use the broadest sense of the word Ã¢ÂÂaccidentÃ¢ÂÂ; one which includes intentional as well as unintentional conduct. To interpret Ã¢ÂÂaccidentÃ¢ÂÂ so as to include only unintentional conduct would exclude some of the situations for which the law was enacted. As the Court of Appeals stated, Ã¢ÂÂ[I]t makes no sense to read the statute as imposing duties on persons who negligently injure others or damage their property but as absolving persons who do so intentionally from any such duties.Ã¢ÂÂ 70 Or.App. at 402, 689 P.2d at 1038.Ã¢ÂÂ
In comparing these diverse views from jurisdictions half a world apart, we consider the Rhode Island and Oregon cases to be better reasoned and consonant with the import of the two California cases cited, People v. Green and People v. Kinney, supra. The intended benefit of the statute flows to the victim, not to the perpetrator. In the case now before us, we conclude *Supp. 7that the California Legislature intended to protect the victims of property damage incidents as well as those suffering personal injury.  Further, it is clear that the lawmakers intended to extend the application of the provisions of section 20002, subdivision (a), to volitional, intended, and purposeful acts, as well as those resulting from unintentional or negligent conduct.
Where terms used in a penal statute have a commonly accepted meaning or are understood by persons of ordinary intelligence, they pass constitutional muster. (1 Witkin, Cal. Crimes (1963) Introduction, ÃÂ§ 26, p. 29; People v. Calimee (1975) 49 Cal.App.3d 337, 341 [122 Cal.Rptr. 658]; People v. Kirk (1975) 49 Cal.App.3d 765, 769 [122 Cal.Rptr. 653]; Los Angeles v. Silver (1979) 98 Cal.App.3d 745, 751 [159 Cal.Rptr. 762].)
Here, a person of normal intelligence and understanding would and should recognize that his damaging of property of another by either intended or unintended use of a motor vehicle requires a response in compliance with section 20002, subdivision (a). DefendantÃ¢ÂÂs contentions represent the strained response of a structured and legally trained mind rather than the common understanding of lay persons who use the public highways subject to the reporting requirements of the Vehicle Code. Defendant was required to make the statutory response or risk the criminal sanctions imposed by law for his failure to do so.

Section 20002, subdivision (a), provides in part: Ã¢ÂÂ(a) The driver of any vehicle involved in an accident resulting in damage to any property, including vehicles, shall immediately stop the vehicle at the scene of the accident and shall then and there do one of the following:
Ã¢ÂÂ(1) Locate and notify the owner or person in charge of such property of the name and address of the driver and owner of the vehicle involved. . . .
Ã¢ÂÂ(2) Leave in a conspicuous place on the vehicle or other property damaged a written notice giving the name and address of the driver and of the owner of the vehicle involved and a statement of the circumstances thereof and shall without unnecessary delay notify the police department of the city wherein the collision occurred or, if the collision occurred in unincorporated territory, the local headquarters of the Department of the California Highway Patrol.
Ã¢ÂÂAny person failing to comply with all the requirements of this section is guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof shall be punished by imprisonment in the county jail for not to exceed six months or by a fine of not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000) or by both.Ã¢ÂÂ


WebsterÃ¢ÂÂs Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary (1985) defines Ã¢ÂÂaccidentÃ¢ÂÂ as: Ã¢ÂÂl.a: an unforeseen and unplanned event or circumstance b: lack of intention or necessity: Chance (met by chance rather than design) 2.a: an unfortunate event resulting esp. from carelessness or ignorance b: an unexpected happening causing loss or injury which is not due to any fault or misconduct on the part of the person injured but for which legal relief may be sought.
BlackÃ¢ÂÂs Law Dictionary (5th ed. 1979) states: Ã¢ÂÂIn its most commonly accepted meaning, or in its ordinary or popular sense, the word may be defined as meaning: a fortuitous circumstance, event, or happening; an event happening without any human agency, or if happening wholly or partly through human agency, an event which under the circumstances is unusual and unexpected by the person to whom it happens; an unusual, fortuitous, unexpected, unforeseen, or unlooked for event, happening or occurrence; an unusual or unexpected result attending the operation or performance of a usual or necessary act or event; chance or contingency, fortune; mishap; some sudden or unexpected event taking place without expectation, upon the instant, rather than something which continues, progresses or develops; something happening by chance; something unforeseen, unexpected, unusual, extraordinary or phenomenal, taking place not according to the usual course of things or events, out of the range of ordinary calculations; that which exists or occurs abnormally, or an uncommon occurrence. . . .Ã¢ÂÂ (Italics added.)

DUFFY, J.
The People appeal an order dismissing the case against defendant after granting a motion to suppress evidence pursuant to Penal Code section 1538.5.
*Supp. 10Facts of the Case
At approximately 2:15 a.m. on May 31, 1984, Officer Alvernaz observed an orange Opel automobile driven by respondent eastbound on Interstate 8. The officerÃ¢ÂÂs attention was drawn to the vehicle because of a Ã¢ÂÂpronounced weavingÃ¢ÂÂ within the lane. The officer described the drift as being two feet in each direction. The officer followed the vehicle while it was weaving for about three quarters of a mile. Due to the weaving observed by the officer the vehicle was stopped. The detention was predicated on the officerÃ¢ÂÂs belief that the driver was under the influence of alcohol.
The municipal court found that the detention was unlawful and that weaving alone within a marked lane was not sufficient cause to stop the vehicle.
Discussion
The sole issue raised on appeal is whether pronounced weaving within a lane provides an officer with reasonable cause to stop the vehicle on suspicion of driving under the influence where such weaving continues for a substantial distance, in this case for about three-quarters of a mile.
It has been firmly established that when a police officer detains a citizen the Fourth Amendment is triggered. Terry v. Ohio (1968) 392 U.S. 1 [20 L.Ed.2d 859, 88 S.Ct. 1868]. A detention occurs Ã¢ÂÂwhenever a police officer accosts an individual and restrains his freedom to walk away,Ã¢ÂÂ (People v. Aldridge (1984) 35 Cal.3d 473, 477 [198 Cal.Rptr. 538, 674 P.2d 240], relying on Terry v. Ohio, supra, 392 U.S. at p. 16 [20 L.Ed.2d at p. 903]) or when an officer stops an individual because that person Ã¢ÂÂmay be personally involved in some criminal activity.Ã¢ÂÂ (In re Tony C. (1978) 21 Cal.3d 888, 892 [148 Cal.Rptr. 366, 582 P.2d 957].)
In order to justify a detention Ã¢ÂÂthe circumstances known or apparent to the officer must include specific and articulable facts causing him to suspect that 1) some activity relating to a crime has taken place or is occurring or is about to occur, and 2) the person he intends to stop or detain is involved in that activity. Not only must he subjectively entertain such a suspicion, but it must be objectively reasonable for him to do so: the facts must be such as would cause any reasonable police officer in a like position, drawing when appropriate on his training and experience [citation] to suspect the same criminal activity. ...Ã¢ÂÂ (People v. Aldridge, supra, 35 Cal.3d at p. 478; People v. Lowen (1983) 35 Cal.3d 117, 123 [196 Cal.Rptr. 846, 672 P.2d 436]; In re Tony C., supra, 21 Cal.3d at p. 893.)
 Although it has been clearly established in this state that weaving from one lane to another justifies an investigatory stop (see Kiskey v. *Supp. 11State of California (1984) 36 Cal.3d 415 [204 Cal.Rptr. 428, 682 P.2d 1093]; People v. Weaver (1983) 143 Cal.App.3d 926 [192 Cal.Rptr. 436]; People v. Goldbreath (1980) 104 Cal.App.3d 988 [164 Cal.Rptr. 116]; People v. Tennessee (1970) 4 Cal.App.3d 788 [84 Cal.Rptr. 697]), no court in California has yet addressed the issue of whether an officer may lawfully detain a driver who has been observed to be weaving within his lane. However, a motorist driving in an Ã¢ÂÂeccentric mannerÃ¢ÂÂ on a freeway has been deemed to be indicative of one driving under the influence justifying an investigatory stop. (People v. Manis (1969) 268 Cal.App.2d 653 [74 Cal.Rptr. 423].) In addition, decisions from outside this jurisdiction have routinely held that weaving within oneÃ¢ÂÂs lane for substantial distances are facts which give rise to a reasonable suspicion that one is driving under the influence. For instance, in State v. Bailey (1981) 51 Or.App. 173 [624 P.2d 663], an Oregon court held that weaving within a lane for a period of four or five blocks justified an investigatory stop. Similarly, in Ebona v. State (Alaska 1978) 577 P.2d 698, the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs vehicle was Ã¢ÂÂcontinually weavingÃ¢ÂÂ but at all times remained in its lane. The court ruled that the reoccurring weaving justified the officerÃ¢ÂÂs detention. In State v. Dorendorf (N.D. 1984) 359 N.W.2d 115, an officer observed a vehicle weaving within its own lane of traffic for approximately one-eighth to one-quarter of a mile. Here too the court determined that such facts gave rise to a reasonable belief that the driver was under the influence, rejecting the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs argument that a smooth continuous weaving within a traffic lane does not give cause to detain. (See also State v. Kvam (Minn. 1983) 336 N.W.2d 525.)
Respondent urges this court to affirm the dismissal in this case contending that in the absence of a traffic violation there could not be any justification for stopping the vehicle. This same argument was rejected in State v. Kvam, supra, at p. 527. The court in Kvam noted that the court should consider that a trained law enforcement officer be permitted to make inferences and deductions that might well elude an untrained person. In the present case, the detaining officer has been a police officer for seven and one-half years and has had extensive training and experience in dealing with driving under the influence cases. Included in his training was driving under the influence enforcement and a drug-alcohol recognition training seminars. The officer presently conducts in-service training of driving under the influence seminars to other officers. The officer inferred from his observation of respondentÃ¢ÂÂs vehicle based on his training and experience that the driver exhibited signs of intoxication. Such opinion was based on the observation of pronounced weaving which continued for about three-quarters of a mile. We conclude that the officerÃ¢ÂÂs actions were proper and hold that pronounced weaving within a lane provides an officer with reasonable cause to stop a vehicle on suspicion of driving under the influence where such weaving continues for a substantial distance.
*Supp. 12In addition, we note that an officer is also justified in stopping a vehicle in such instance to investigate the cause of such weaving as the weaving is also indicative of possible equipment violations (i.e., faulty wheel alignment, problem in the steering mechanism or defect in the tires). The officer had the right to determine exactly what was causing the vehicle to weave.
Accordingly, the ruling of the lower court is reversed.
McConnell, P. J., and Hamrick, J., concurred.

CHAPMAN, J.
The People of the State of California appeal from an order of the Municipal Court for the Santa Clara Judicial District of Santa Clara County dismissing a felony complaint against the respondent, Alonzo Cham-blis, pursuant to Penal Code section 1385.
Before the appeal can be decided on its merits, the court must determine a threshold question of jurisdiction, i.e., is the appellant pursuing the correct remedy?
A casual reading of Penal Code section 1466 might suggest that an appeal might be taken from an order of the municipal court dismissing a felony complaint pursuant to Penal Code section 1385. Section 1466 provides in part: Ã¢ÂÂAn appeal may be taken from a judgment or order of an inferior court, in a criminal case, to the superior court of the county in which such inferior court is located, in the following cases, (a) By the people. (1) From an order or judgment dismissing or otherwise terminating the action before the defendant has been placed in jeopardy. . . .Ã¢ÂÂ (Italics added.)
However, it is well settled that when a municipal court judge processes a felony complaint he does not sit as a court but as a magistrate. Ã¢ÂÂThe words Ã¢ÂÂinferior courtÃ¢ÂÂ or Ã¢ÂÂinferior courtsÃ¢ÂÂ include municipal courts, justice courts, city courts, police courts, police judgeÃ¢ÂÂs courts, and all courts other than superior courts, having jurisdiction to try misdemeanor charges. Ã¢ÂÂ (People v. Peters (1978) 21 Cal.3d 749, 752 [147 Cal.Rptr. 646, 581 P.2d 651].) (Italics that of the Supreme Court.)
*Supp. 15In People v. Peters, supra, the Supreme Court held that the language of Penal Code section 1385, as it was then written, did not give authority to municipal court judges, sitting as magistrates, to dismiss an action in the interest of justice. The reason being that section 1385 then provided that Ã¢ÂÂThe court may ... in the furtherance of justice, order an action to be dismissed.Ã¢ÂÂ The Supreme Court held that the word Ã¢ÂÂcourtÃ¢ÂÂ did not include a magistrate.
In 1980 Penal Code section 1385 was amended to provide: Ã¢ÂÂThe judge or magistrate may ... in the furtherance of justice, order an action to be dismissed.Ã¢ÂÂ
Apparently recognizing that such an order by a magistrate would not be appealable under Penal Code section 1466 because it would not be an Ã¢ÂÂorder of an inferior court,Ã¢ÂÂ the Legislature provided a statutory remedy for the review of an order of a magistrate dismissing an action pursuant to section 1385. As part of the same legislative package in 1980, the Legislature created a new procedure providing for a motion to reinstate. Section 871.5, subdivision (a) provides in part: Ã¢ÂÂWhen an action is dismissed by a magistrate pursuant to Section . . . 1385 ... the prosecutor may make a motion in the superior court within 15 days to compel the magistrate to reinstate the complaint. ...Ã¢ÂÂ (Italics added.)
In the instant case the prosecutor did not attempt to move pursuant to section 871.5, subdivision (a) to reinstate the complaint. Instead, the prosecutor sought to appeal from a nonappealable order. The notice of appeal was filed more than 15 days after the dismissal was ordered by the magistrate and, therefore, would not have been timely even if correctly framed as a motion to reinstate.
For the foregoing reasons, the appeal by the People of the State of California in the above entitled action is dismissed.
The court at this time does not comment on the prosecutorÃ¢ÂÂs right to refile the action pursuant to Penal Code section 1387.

SILVER, P. J.-
Introduction
The People of the State of California appeal from an adverse judgment entered upon the order of the municipal court sustaining WilliamsÃ¢ÂÂ demurrer, without leave to amend, to the PeopleÃ¢ÂÂs complaint. Williams was cited for travelling 65 miles per hour, 10 miles per hour faster than the maximum speed limit in violation of California Vehicle Code section 22348, subdivision (a). The demurrer raised two constitutional objections to this stateÃ¢ÂÂs 55-mile-per-hour maximum speed law:
(1) California adopted the maximum speed limit as the result of federal coercion and in violation of the Tenth Amendment to the federal Constitution; and
(2) California impermissibly delegated its legislative authority to Congress by conditioning repeal of the state speed limit upon federal repeal of the national speed limit.
For reasons discussed below, we reject respondentÃ¢ÂÂs constitutional challenge and reverse the decision of the trial court.
The constitutional issues raised by Williams in the instant action are not novel. The extent to which Congress may in the exercise of its delegated powers utilize the states and their political machinery to pursue federal policy goals has been the subject of much litigation and commentary. The issues are complex and the courts have experienced difficulty in striking an appropriate balance between the federal interest in establishing uniform national policy and local concerns of states necessitating peculiarly local resolution. (Compare National League of Cities v. Usery (1976) 426 U.S. 833 [49 L.Ed.2d 245, 96 S.Ct. 2465] with Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority (1985) 469 U.S. 528 [83 L.Ed.2d 1016, 105 S.Ct. 1005].) We respect the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs concern over these issues and recognize the constitutional importance of striking an appropriate balance between federal and state power.
*Supp. 21Legislative History
On January 2, 1974, during the embargo of oil sales to the United States by Arab members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), the United States Congress established a national 55-mile-per-hour speed limit in the Emergency Highway Energy Conservation Act (Pub.L. No. 93-239, 87 Stat. 1046). The law was an emergency measure designed to reduce the nationÃ¢ÂÂs fuel consumption during the embargo. (1973 U.S. Code Cong. & Admin. News, pp. 3344, 3345.) Section 2(a) of the act conditioned the receipt of federal funds upon each state establishing a 55 miles per hour maximum speed limit upon the public highways within its jurisdiction.1 Section 2(e) provided that the emergency act was subject to termination by executive order when the President had determined that the fuel shortage crisis had passed or, alternatively, automatic termination on June 30, 1975, whichever date occurred first. (1973 U.S. Code Cong. & Admin. News, pp. 1170, 1171.) Section 3 made available to the states 90-percent federal funding for approved demonstration projects designed to encourage the use of car pools in urban areas. (Id., at pp. 1171-1172.)
California quickly followed suit, enacting Vehicle Code section 22348, subdivision (a) by emergency legislation on January 1, 1974. (Stats. 1973, ch. 1218, ÃÂ§ 1, p. 2935.) Section 4 of the legislation declared its purpose to be the institution of Ã¢ÂÂmore realistic reduced speed limits as a measure to help alleviate serious and far-reaching fuel shortages . . . .Ã¢ÂÂ (Id., ÃÂ§4, p. 2935.) Section 1 of the 1973 legislation provided that Vehicle Code section 22348 would remain in effect only until June 30, 1975, unless extended by a later enactment.
One year later (Jan. 4, 1975) Congress acted to make permanent a national 55-mile-per-hour speed limit by continuing an incentive approach which barred federal highway aid to states which failed to enact a maximum state speed limit of 55 miles per hour. (Pub.L. No. 93-643, 88 Stat. 2281, ÃÂ§11.) Ã¢ÂÂThe legislative history of this bill clearly shows that Congress sought this more permanent 55 m.p.h. speed limit for both highway safety and fuel conservation reasons.Ã¢ÂÂ (Marks v. Mobil Oil Corp. (E.D.Pa. 1983) 562 F.Supp. 759, 771, affÃ¢ÂÂd 727 F.2d 1100.) As the House Public Works Committee stated in its report on the bill: Ã¢ÂÂThe benefits of the lower maximum speed limit has [sic] been so substantial that the Committee is proposing that it be continued until such time as the Congress declares by *Supp. 22concurrent resolution that it is no longer necessary. [ÃÂ¶] According to reports from the Federal Energy Administration, over five million gallons of fuel have been saved daily as a result of the reduction in speeds and travel on the highways. This should be reason enough to maintain the lower speed limits; however, there has also been a sharp reduction in highway fatalities. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has estimated a 20-percent drop in traffic fatalities, which represents 1,000 fewer Americans being killed each month. [ÃÂ¶] . . . Results of a National Safety Council study indicate that 46 percent of the reduction is the result of reduced speeds .... A recent study by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials found that approximately half of the reduction in traffic fatalities is the result of reduced speeds and more uniform speeds . . . .Ã¢ÂÂ (House Report No. 93-1567, reprinted in 1974 U.S. Code Cong. & Admin. News, at p. 8019.)
The bill added section 154 to chapter 1 of title 23 of the United States Code providing that the Secretary of Transportation could not approve any project under section 106 of title 232 in any state which has a maximum speed limit on any public highway within its jurisdiction in excess of 55 miles per hour. (Pub.L. No. 93-643, ÃÂ§ 114, reprinted at 1974 U.S. Code Cong. & Admin. News, at p. 2657.) The bill also added section 141 which requires states to certify annually that they were enforcing the 55-miles-per-hour speed limit. (Pub.L. No. 93-643, ÃÂ§ 107, reprinted at 1974 U.S. Code Cong. & Admin. News, at p. 2654.)
Due to the impending repeal of the California legislation on June 30, 1975, the California Legislature by emergency legislation extended the date of repeal until June 30, 1978. (Stats. 1975, ch. 153, ÃÂ§ 1, p. 285.) The federal legislation no longer had a termination date. Three years later, the California Legislature, facing automatic repeal of section 22348, again acted to preserve the 55-mile-per-hour speed limit. In apparent response to the permanency of the federal legislation they enacted section 2 of Statutes 1978, chapter 217 (at p. 467) as follows: Ã¢ÂÂIt is the intent of the Legislature, in enacting this act, to recognize that the 55-mile-per-hour national maximum speed limit, as specified in Section 154 of Title 23 of the United States Code, which, when originally enacted would have terminated on June 30, 1975, no longer contains an automatic termination date. In recognition of this, the Legislature finds it appropriate to amend Section 22348 of the Vehicle Code accordingly. [ÃÂ¶] It is the further intent of the Legislature that if such 55-mile-per-hour maximum speed limit is ever revised by either increasing or decreasing such limit, the Legislature will review the provisions of Section 22348 of the Vehicle Code to ascertain whether it would be appropriate to amend such provisions.Ã¢ÂÂ
*Supp. 23Accordingly the Legislature added subdivision (c) to California Vehicle Code section 22348 which provided that section 22348 Ã¢ÂÂshall remain in effect 120 days from the date that the 55-mile-per-hour national maximum speed limit, as specified in section 154 of Title 23 of the United States Code, is repealed.Ã¢ÂÂ (Stats. 1978, ch. 217, ÃÂ§ 1, p. 466.)

The Enactment of Vehicle Code Section 22348, Subdivision (c) Did Not Constitute a Delegation of Legislative Power to the Federal Government.

Article IV, section 1 of the California Constitution provides that: Ã¢ÂÂ[t]he legislative power of this State is vested in the California Legislature . . . .Ã¢ÂÂ The power to declare whether or not there shall be a law, to determine the general purpose or policy to be achieved by the law and to fix the limits of its operation cannot be delegated.
Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂAn unconstitutional delegation of legislative power occurs when the Legislature confers . . . unrestricted authority to make fundamental policy decisions. [Citations.]Ã¢ÂÂ In order to avoid an unlawful delegation of its authority, the Legislature must first resolve the Ã¢ÂÂtruly fundamental issues,Ã¢ÂÂ and must then Ã¢ÂÂestablish an effective mechanism to assure the proper implementation of its policy decisions.Ã¢ÂÂ (Kugler v. Yocum, [(1968)] 69 Cal.2d [371,] at pp. 376-377 [71 Cal.Rptr. 687, 445 P.2d 303].)Ã¢ÂÂ (Wilkinson v. Madera Community Hospital (1983) 144 Cal.App.3d 436, 442 [192 Cal.Rptr. 593].)
The fact that a third party, whether private or governmental, performs some role in the application and implementation of an established legislative scheme does not render the legislation invalid as an unlawful delegation. (Kugler v. Yocum (1968) 69 Cal.2d 371, at pp. 379-380 [71 Cal.Rptr. 687, 445 P.2d 303]; Salmon Trollers Marketing Assn. v. Fullerton (1981) 124 Cal.App.3d 291, 299 [177 Cal.Rptr. 362].)  Ã¢ÂÂIn order to hold a statute invalid as an unlawful delegation of legislative power, it must be clear that without the exercise of legislative power by the person or body to whom the delegation has been made, the statute remains incomplete so that the legislative will has not been fully made known.Ã¢ÂÂ (16 C.J.S., Constitutional Law, ÃÂ§ 137, pp. 448-449, fn. omitted.)
In this case the California Legislature has not delegated its Ã¢ÂÂlegislative powerÃ¢ÂÂ to enact laws for the regulation of speed laws in California or its Ã¢ÂÂfunctionÃ¢ÂÂ to determine the contents of those speed laws. In enacting the 55-mile-per-hour speed limit the Legislature declared its purpose to be the institution of Ã¢ÂÂmore realistic reduced speed limits as a measure to help alleviate serious and far-reaching fuel shortages . . . .Ã¢ÂÂ (Stats. 1973, ch. 1218, ÃÂ§ 4, at p. 2935.) The exercise of legislative discretion was in the determination that the policy of California will be to conform its maximum *Supp. 24speed limit upon public highways with the national standard as a joint effort with the federal government to curtail the national fuel shortage and to encourage traffic safety upon public highways. The fact that California has adopted legislation conforming to federal standards does not, in and of itself render the legislation invalid. (See, e.g., Brock v. Superior Court (1937) 9 Cal.2d 291 [71 P.2d 209]; Salmon Trollers Marketing Assn. v. Fullerton, supra, 124 Cal.App.3d 291 [177 Cal.Rptr. 362].) Further, the California Legislature may condition the continued validity of a statute upon a state of events in the control of a third party, be it a private or governmental agency, as long as California retains control over fundamental policy decisions, insures against abuses of the delegated power, and makes no attempt to enact future regulations of another jurisdiction as part of state law. Here California has retained absolute authority to establish speed limits within its territorial boundaries, thus ensuring that the federal government cannot arbitrarily impose a maximum speed limit in California. The California statute does not provide that, if the federal maximum speed limit is ever revised, such amendment will be automatically applicable in California. The Legislature declared Ã¢ÂÂthat if [the] 55-mile-per-hour maximum speed limit is ever revised by either increasing or decreasing such limit, the Legislature will review the provisions of Section 22348 of the Vehicle Code to ascertain whether it would be appropriate to amend such provisions. Ã¢ÂÂ (Stats. 1978, ch. 217, ÃÂ§ 2, p. 467, italics added.) To accomplish this review the statute provided that the 55-mile-per-hour speed limit would remain in effect 120 days after any federal change in the national speed limit. (Id., ÃÂ§ 1, p. 466.)
The statutory scheme at issue here is similar to that upheld by the Supreme Court of Kansas in State v. Dumler (1977) 221 Kan. 386 [559 P.2d 798], and significantly different from that overturned by the Supreme Court of Montana in Lee v. State (1981) 195 Mont. 1 [635 P.2d 1282], cert. den. 456 U.S. 1006 [73 L.Ed.2d 1300, 102 S.Ct. 2295].
In response to the 1974 federal legislation, Kansas, like California, adopted legislation establishing a maximum speed limit of 55 miles per hour (Laws 1974, chs. 29 and 30, codified at Kan.Stat.Ann. 1974 Supp. 8-1336), and authorized revision of the statutory maximum speed limit if Congress decided to alter the limit: Ã¢ÂÂIn the event that Congress of the United States shall establish a maximum speed limit greater or less than the limit prescribed by this paragraph, the state highway commission may adopt a resolution, subject to the approval of the governor, establishing such speed limit as the maximum speed limit of this state.Ã¢ÂÂ (Kan.Stat.Ann. 1974 Supp. 8-1336, subd. (3).)
The Kansas legislation Ã¢ÂÂsuspendedÃ¢ÂÂ the operation of its existing speed laws and the power of the state highway commission or local authorities to *Supp. 25establish maximum speed limits until the date upon which Congress removed all restrictions upon maximum speed laws. (Kan.Stat.Ann. 1974 Supp. 8-1340.) Section 8-1340 provided in pertinent part: Ã¢ÂÂThe provisions of this act shall expire on the date when the Congress of the United States shall remove all restrictions on maximum speed limits, and until said date [the statutes] of this State establishing or authorizing the state highway commission or local authorities to establish maximum speed limits are hereby suspended.Ã¢ÂÂ
The Kansas Supreme Court rejected the appellantÃ¢ÂÂs contention that the new maximum speed law was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power of the State of Kansas to the United States. Appellant contended then, as Williams does here, that by making the maximum highway speed limit in Kansas contingent upon future actions of the United States Congress, it would be Congress which would dictate the Kansas maximum speed limit.
In rejecting this contention the Kansas Supreme Court stated: Ã¢ÂÂIn analyzing 8-1336 and 8-1340 it is clear that the Kansas legislature has by no means totally yielded to the Congress its authority to establish maximum speed limits in Kansas. By virtue of 8-1340 the supplemental act, which creates the 55 miles per hour speed limit, expires on the date when the Congress of the United States shall remove regulations on maximum speed limits and the provisions of 8-1557, 8-1558, 8-1559, and 8-1560 [establishing a daytime speed limit of 70 miles per hour and a 60 mile-per-hour limit during the nighttime] immediately come into operation. Should Congress prescribe a different maximum speed limit for a state to qualify for federal highway funds, such action does not per se establish a new maximum speed limit in Kansas. When congressional action occurs, it is the state highway commission (secretary of transportation) acting pursuant to statute who has authority to establish the maximum speed limits of this state. Here the legislature, rather than delegating legislative power to the Congress, has simply enacted a law to become operational on the happening of a certain contingency or future event.Ã¢ÂÂ (State v. Dumler, supra, 559 P.2d at p. 804.) The California statutes provide a similar scheme of review.
In comparison, the Montana Supreme Court invalidated legislation granting the United States Congress unrestricted authority to establish speed limits within the State of Montana. The Montana Legislature mandated that the Attorney General, by proclamation, change the speed limit on public highways to equal the maximum speed limit established by the federal government whenever the federal government established such a maximum speed limit as a condition to the stateÃ¢ÂÂs continuing eligibility to receive funds authorized by the Federal Aid Highways Act of 1973, and to terminate the proclaimed speed limit Ã¢ÂÂwhenever such a speed is no longer required by *Supp. 26federal law.Ã¢ÂÂ (Mont.Code Ann., ÃÂ§ 61-8-305(2).) The court distinguished Dumler. In the Kansas legislation the power granted to a state official or body to adopt speed limits was couched in permissive instead of mandatory terms. (Lee v. State, supra, 635 P.2d at p. 1286; cf. City of Princeton v. Francisco (S.D. Iowa 1978) 454 F.Supp. 33, 34.) Had the Legislature itself established the speed limit, the court would have upheld the statuteÃ¢ÂÂs constitutionality. Ã¢ÂÂWe want to state clearly that had the legislature itself established the speed limit originally or at any subsequent session, we should then have found such enactment constitutional, even though it may have been in response to the federal requirements.Ã¢ÂÂ (Lee v. State, supra, 635 P.2d at p. 1287.) CaliforniaÃ¢ÂÂs legislation is not only permissive but provides for a 120-day delay and review period.

CongressÃ¢ÂÂ Adoption of 23 United States Code, Section 154(a), Conditioning State Receipt of Federal Aid for State Highway Projects Under the Federal-Aid Highway Act (23 U.S.C. ÃÂ§ 101 et seq.) Upon Participating States Ã¢ÂÂ Enforcement of a 55-mile-per-hour Maximum Speed Limit Within Their Territorial Limits Is a Valid Exercise of Congressional Power Under the Spending Clause (U.S. Const., art. I, ÃÂ§ 8, cl. 1).

A legislative act is presumed to be constitutional. Ã¢ÂÂ[NJothing but a clear violation of the Constitution will justify a Court in overruling the legislative will.Ã¢ÂÂ (People v. Parks (1881) 58 Cal. 624, 635; see FERC v. Mississippi (1982) 456 U.S. 742, 754 [72 L.Ed.2d 532, 543, 102 S.Ct. 2126], reh. den. 458 U.S. 1131 [73 L.Ed.2d 1401, 103 S.Ct. 15].) Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂUnconstitutionality must be clearly shown, and doubts will be resolved in favor of its validity.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ (Salmon Trollers Marketing Assn. v. Fullerton, supra, 124 Cal.App.3d 291, 299 [177 Cal.Rptr. 362], quoting 5 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (8th ed. 1974) Constitutional Law, ÃÂ§43, p. 3281; Kizziah v. Department of Transportation (1981) 121 Cal.App.3d 11, 18 [175 Cal.Rptr. 112].)
The spending power is encompassed in article I, section 8, clause 1, of the United States Constitution and states that the Ã¢ÂÂCongress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes . . . to . . . provide for the . . . general Welfare of the United States . . . .Ã¢ÂÂ  Although article I, section 8 lists certain specific areas for which Congress has the Ã¢ÂÂpower to spend,Ã¢ÂÂ it has been held that the Ã¢ÂÂpower to spendÃ¢ÂÂ encompassed within the Ã¢ÂÂgeneral welfareÃ¢ÂÂ clause is not limited to these specific areas. The Ã¢ÂÂgeneral welfare clauseÃ¢ÂÂ is itself an independentÃ¢ÂÂand expansiveÃ¢ÂÂsource of CongressÃ¢ÂÂ spending authority. (Buckley v. Valeo (1976) 424 U.S. 1, 90-91 [46 L.Ed.2d 659, 728, 96 S.Ct. 612]; State of Okl. v. Schweiker (D.C. Cir. 1981) 655 F.2d 401, 405.) Moreover, Congress may attach conditions to the disbursement of federal funds as long as those conditions are related to a legitimate national *Supp. 27goal in providing for the general welfare of the nation, have a rational relationship to the purpose of the federal funds whose receipt is conditioned, and are unambiguous. (Pennhurst State School v. Halderman (1981) 451 U.S. 1, 17 [67 L.Ed.2d 694, 707, 101 S.Ct. 1531]; Oklahoma v. Civil Service CommÃ¢ÂÂn. (1947) 330 U.S. 127, 143 [91 L.Ed. 794, 806, 67 S.Ct. 544]; Steward Machine Co. v. Davis (1937) 301 U.S. 548, 590-593 [81 L.Ed. 1279, 1293-1294, 57 S.Ct. 883].) The conditions need not be restricted to those areas over which Congress has direct regulatory authority. (State of Okl. v. Schweiker, supra, at p. 406.)  Moreover, when Congress is legislating for the Ã¢ÂÂgeneral welfare,Ã¢ÂÂ the means chosen by Congress to effectuate the congressional purpose are necessarily valid if Congress could reasonably conclude that Ã¢ÂÂthe means are Ã¢ÂÂnecessary and properÃ¢ÂÂ to promote the general welfare.Ã¢ÂÂ (Buckley v. Valeo, supra, at p. 91 [46 L.Ed.2d at p. 728].) The concept of the general welfare is not a static one. Ã¢ÂÂNeeds that were narrow or parochial a century ago may be interwoven in our day with the well-being of the nation. What is critical or urgent changes with the times.Ã¢ÂÂ (Helvering v. Davis (1937) 301 U.S. 619, 641 [81 L.Ed. 1307, 1315, 57 S.Ct. 904].)
There appear to be four prerequisites to a finding that a spending clause measure and condition attached to it are valid: (1) The federal power is used for a legitimate national purpose, i.e., promotion of the general welfare (Oklahoma v. Civil Service CommÃ¢ÂÂn., supra, at p. 143 [91 L.Ed. at p. 806]; Steward Machine Co. v. Davis, supra, at pp. 585-590 [81 L.Ed. at pp. 1290-1293]); (2) the condition is related to a legitimate national goal (Steward Machine Co. v. Davis, supra, at pp. 590-591 [81 L.Ed at pp. 1292-1293]; Note, Federal Grants and the Tenth Amendment: Ã¢ÂÂThings As They AreÃ¢ÂÂ and Fiscal Federalism (1981) 50 Fordham L.Rev. 130, 140-141); (3) the condition is related to the purpose of the federal funds whose receipt is conditioned (FCC v. League of Women Voters (1984) 468 U.S. 407 [82 L.Ed.2d 278, 309] (Rehnquist, J., dis.); State of Okl. v. Schweiker, supra, 655 F.2d at pp. 407, 411); and (4) the condition is unambiguous (Pennhurst State School v. Halderman, supra, 451 U.S. at p. 17 [67 L.Ed.2d at p. 707].)
Each of the foregoing prerequisites is satisfied in the instant case. Preservation of the nationÃ¢ÂÂs fossil fuels and reduction of traffic fatalities are matters of national concern. It has been stated that a Ã¢ÂÂproblem is national where its solution requires uniform treatment throughout the nation and remedial legislation by the one body that can give uniform controlÃ¢ÂÂthe Congress.Ã¢ÂÂ (2 Antieau, Modern Constitutional Law (1969) ÃÂ§ 10.28, p. 58.) The fuel conservation measures necessitated by the OPEC crisis required the attention of the federal government both on a domestic and international *Supp. 28level. The states were completely ill-equipped to handle such a crisis; it cannot be disputed that the matter was of national concern.
Second, the condition here is reasonably tailored to effectuate the national goal. The statistics from the Federal Energy Administration establish that automobile speed is a significant factor in fuel economy and, necessarily, in preserving the nationÃ¢ÂÂs fuel reserves. The reduced automobile speed was also correlated with a drastic reduction in traffic fatalities indicating that the nationÃ¢ÂÂs interest in the public health of its citizens was also being served by the legislation.
Third, the condition in this instance (compliance with a national 55-mile-per-hour speed limit), is reasonably related to one of the purposes of the federal spending measure (Federal Aid Highway Act) because it promotes traffic safety. Section 105(f) of title 23 of the United States Code requires the Secretary of Transportation to Ã¢ÂÂgive priority to those projects which incorporate improved standards and features with safety benefits.Ã¢ÂÂ Since one of the principle purposes of the Emergency Highway Energy Conservation Act is to promote safer conditions on roadways by reducing automobile speed, its purpose is necessarily correlated with that of the Federal-Aid Highway Act funding provision which also has as one of its principle purposes the improvement of roadways to improve traffic safety.
Fourth, the condition upon which highway funds are to be appropriated is clear and unambiguous: a 55-mile-per-hour speed limit must be enacted by the states as to all Ã¢ÂÂhighwaysÃ¢ÂÂ as defined in title 23 of the United States Code, section 101(a), or the Secretary of Transportation shall not approve any project under 23 United States Code section 106 in that state. (23 U.S.C. ÃÂ§ 154(a).) Congress has therefore acted within its delegated power under the spending clause to condition state receipt of federal highway aid upon state assent to the federal national speed limit on all public highways within the state.

CongressÃ¢ÂÂ Conditional Grant of Federal Highway Monies to States Adopting the 55-mile-per-hour Speed Limit Does Not Unconstitutionally Infringe Upon State Sovereignty Under the Tenth Amendment.

The extent to which the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution acts as a limitation upon the enumerated powers of Congress has been the subject of much debate. The Tenth Amendment to the Constitution provides: Ã¢ÂÂThe powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.Ã¢ÂÂ Up until the latter half of the 1970Ã¢ÂÂs the United States Supreme Court cases interpreted the Tenth Amendment as a mere truism: *Supp. 29Ã¢ÂÂ[A]ll is retained which has not been surrendered.Ã¢ÂÂ (United States v. Darby (1941) 312 U.S. 100, 124 [85 L.Ed. 609, 622, 61 S.Ct. 451]; see also, Sperry v. Florida (1963) 373 U.S. 379, 403 [10 L.Ed.2d 428, 442-443, 83 S.Ct. 1322].) The Tenth Amendment was not seen as establishing any constitutional limitation on the delegated powers of Congress beyond those already existent. Not surprisingly, the cases interpreting the extent of congressional power under the spending clause followed the reasoning of Darby, supra. In Oklahoma v. Civil Service CommÃ¢ÂÂn., supra, 330 U.S. 127, the Supreme Court upheld against Tenth Amendment challenge the provisions of the Hatch Act prohibiting officers and employees of state or local agencies, whose principal employment was in connection with any activity which was financed in whole or in part by federal funds, from taking any active part in political management or in political campaigns. A member of a state highway commission was also chairman of the Democratic State Central Committee and participated in political fund raising activities. Highway commission activities were financed by allotment of federal funds. The state refused to remove the official and the Civil Service Commission, pursuant to statutory authority, certified that state highway funds in an amount equal to two yearÃ¢ÂÂs compensation of the official at the time of the violation should be withheld.
The Supreme Court held that the actÃ¢ÂÂs provisions were constitutional even though the action taken by Congress did affect local political activities. The court noted that Ã¢ÂÂ[w]hile the United States is not concerned with, and has no power to regulate, local political activities as such of state officials, it does have power to fix the terms upon which its money allotments to states shall be dispursed.Ã¢ÂÂ (Id., at p. 143 [91 L.Ed. at p. 806].) The court continued with the observation that Ã¢ÂÂ [t]he offer of benefits to a state by the United States dependent upon cooperation by the state with federal plans, assumedly for the general welfare, is not unusual.Ã¢ÂÂ (Id., at p. 144 [91 L.Ed. at p. 807], fn. omitted that cites Steward Machine Co. v. Davis, supra, 301 U.S. at pp. 593-598 [81 L.Ed. at pp. 1294-1296, 57 S.Ct. 883]; United States v. Bekins (1938) 304 U.S. 27, 51-54 [82 L.Ed. 1137, 1143-1145, 58 S.Ct. 811].) The objective of the Hatch Act was to promote Ã¢ÂÂbetter public service by requiring those who administer funds for national needs to abstain from active political partisanship.Ã¢ÂÂ (Oklahoma, supra, at p. 143 [91 L.Ed. at p. 806].) As a legitimate concern of Congress in promoting the public welfare, the offer of benefits to the state conditioned upon cooperation with federal plans was legitimate. (Id., at p. 144 [91 L.Ed. at p. 807].) Even though Congress did not have authority to directly regulate the political activities of employees in state and local public agencies, it could condition the receipt of federal highway funds upon acceptance of federal standards. Thus, if the spending clause measure itself was valid and the states were free to accept or reject both the optional condition and the spending *Supp. 30measure upon which the condition was attached, the Tenth Amendment was not violated.
In Steward Machine Co. v. Davis, supra, 301 U.S. 548 [81 L.Ed. 1279, 57 S.Ct. 883] the court upheld the tax imposed as part of the Social Security Act of 1935 (49 Stat. 620, current version at 42 U.S.C. ÃÂ§ 301 et seq.) which established a tax and credit system to induce states to set up unemployment compensation programs in accordance with federal guidelines.
The Supreme Court held that the statute did not call for surrender by the states of powers essential to their quasi-sovereign existence. The conditions imposed were limited to assuring the effectiveness of the state unemployment insurance laws and final discretion as to the type of statute to be adopted to serve this purpose was left to the states. (Steward Machine Co. v. Davis, supra, 301 U.S. at pp. 593-594 [81 L.Ed. at p. 1294].)
In 1976, the United States Supreme Court, reacting to an apparent growing concern for state interests, in interpreting the Tenth Amendment, held that Congress may not exercise its delegated powers in a fashion that impairs the statesÃ¢ÂÂ integrity or their Ã¢ÂÂability to function effectively in a federal system.Ã¢ÂÂ (National League of Cities v. Usery, supra, 426 U.S. at p. 852 [49 L.Ed.2d at p. 257, 96 S.Ct. 2465].)
In National League of Cities, several cities, states and organizations thereof had sued to test the validity of the 1974 amendments of the Fair Labor Standards Act (29 U.S.C. ÃÂ§ 201 et seq.). This act extended statutory minimum wage and maximum hours provisions to employees of states and their political subdivisions. The court held that the amendments exceeded CongressÃ¢ÂÂ power under the commerce clause in that they forced directly upon the states CongressÃ¢ÂÂ choices as to how essential decisions regarding the conduct of integral governmental functions were to be made. The court noted that the extension of the wage provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act imposed substantial cost upon the states and their political subdivisions and displaced state policies regarding the manner in which they could structure governmental services. For instance, the court stated the act would forbid states from offering part-time or summer employment at a figure less than the minimum wage and states would have to structure work periods in some employment areas, like police and fire protection, in a manner substantially different from previous practice. The court held that the effect of the amendments was to unconstitutionally interfere with an integral governmental function of the states. (Id., at p. 852.) National League of Cities Ã¢ÂÂtherefore drew from the Tenth Amendment an Ã¢ÂÂaffirmative limitation on the exercise of [congressional power] . . . .Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ (EEOC v. Wyoming (1983) *Supp. 31460 U.S. 226, 236 [75 L.Ed.2d 18, 29, 103 S.Ct. 1054] quoting National League of Cities, supra, at p. 841.)
Although National League of Cities was a commerce clause case which expressly reserved judgment on the application of the Tenth Amendment to other delegated powers, including the spending power (426 U.S. at p. 852, fn. 17 [49 L.Ed.2d at p. 258, fn. 17]), it was a new starting pointing in recognizing the Tenth Amendment as an active limitation on the exercise of federal powers. (See Pennhurst State School v. Halderman, supra, 451 U.S. at p. 17, fn. 13 [67 L.Ed.2d at p. 707, 101 S.Ct. 1531].)
Since the decision in National League of Cities was handed down, the frequency of Tenth Amendment challenges to conditions attached to various federal grant programs increased dramatically. Yet no case has been cited which invalidated a funding condition. (See State of Okl. v. Schweiker, supra, 655 F.2d at p. 406, fn. 9 and cases cited therein.) Instead, the federal courts have chosen to rely on the distinction drawn between direct regulation over a particular area traditionally reserved to the sovereign authority of states, and the use of the federal largesse to indirectly Ã¢ÂÂinduceÃ¢ÂÂ states to support certain federal policies. As long as the states are free to accept or reject the federally funded program and conditions attached to that program, state sovereignty is not invaded. (Florida Dept. of Health, etc. v. Califano (N.D. Fla. 1978) 449 F.Supp. 274, 284-285, cert. den. 441 U.S. 931 [60 L.Ed.2d 659, 99 S.Ct. 2051]; see City of Macon v. Marshall (M.D.Ga. 1977) 439 F.Supp. 1209, 1217-1218.) As was said by the Nebraska Supreme Court in State v. Padley (1976) 195 Neb. 358 [237 N.W.2d 883] in rejecting a similar Tenth Amendment challenge to the same federal legislation challenged herein: Ã¢ÂÂWe are at a loss to follow this reasoning. It is the privilege of Congress to fix the terms upon which federal money allotments to the states shall be made and it is entirely optional with the states to accept or reject such offers. There is no coercion and each state acts of its own volition.Ã¢ÂÂ (State v. Padley, supra, 237 N.W.2d at p. 885. Accord People v. Austin (1983) 111 Ill.App.3d 213 [443 N.E.2d 1107, 1108].)
Whatever significance National League of Cities had as establishing a Tenth Amendment limitation of federal powers was erased in Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, supra, 469 U.S. 528 [83 L.Ed.2d 1016, 105 S.Ct. 1005].
In Garcia, the Court rejected the constitutional interpretation of the Tenth Amendment as a limitation on the delegated powers of Congress under the commerce clause as espoused in National League of Cities. The majority concluded that the holding of National League was unmanageable on a prac*Supp. 32tical level. It would prevent a court from Ã¢ÂÂaccommodating changes in the historical functions of StatesÃ¢ÂÂ and was unnecessary for the protection of state interests. (Garcia, supra, 469 U.S. at p. Ã¢ÂÂ [83 L.Ed.2d at pp. 1029-1031].) The majority found that the limitations on the exercise of delegated powers found in the Constitution itself and active representation of state interests by representatives in federal government through the political process would ensure that state sovereignty would not be unduly infringed by Congress in the exercise of its delegated powers. (Id., at p. Ã¢ÂÂ [83 L.Ed.2d at pp. 1034-1035].)
In Garcia, the specific question before the court was the propriety of the 1974 amendments to the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) subjecting employees of public mass transit and virtually all state and local government employees, including the San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority (SAMTA), to the minimum-wage and overtime requirements of the FLSA. (See 29 U.S.C. ÃÂ§ 203(d) and (x).) The court noted that SAMTA, as a qualifying mass-transit program under the Urban Mass Transportation Act (UMTA) (49 U.S.C. ÃÂ§ 1601 et seq.) received approximately 75 percent of its operating expenses through federal subsidies and local sales tax. SAMTA complied with the above provisions of the FLSA until 1976 when the high court held in National League of Cities that the FLSA could not be applied constitutionally to the Ã¢ÂÂtraditional governmental functionsÃ¢ÂÂ of state and local governments. (National League of Cities, supra, at p. 852 [49 L.Ed.2d at p. 258].) Four months after National League of Cities was decided, SAM-TA informed its employees that the decision relieved SAMTA of its overtime obligations under the FLSA. However, in 1979 the Wage and Hour Administration of the Department of Labor issued an opinion that SAMTAÃ¢ÂÂs operations were not constitutionally immune from the application of the FLSA under National League of Cities. SAMTA filed an action against the Secretary of Labor seeking a declaratory judgment that National League of Cities precluded the application of the FLSAÃ¢ÂÂs overtime requirements to SAMTA. The secretary counterclaimed for enforcement of the overtime and record-keeping requirements of the FLSA and Garcia and several employees of SAMTA filed separate suit seeking overtime pay and intervened as defendants in the action between SAMTA and the secretary.
Relying upon National League of Cities the district court granted SAM-TAÃ¢ÂÂs motion for summary judgment. The Secretary and Garcia both appealed directly to the Supreme Court. During the pendency of those appeals Transportation Union v. Long Island R. Co. (1982) 455 U.S. 678 [71 L.Ed.2d 547, 102 S.Ct. 1349] was decided. In that case the court ruled that commuter rail service provided by the state-owned Long Island Railroad did not constitute a Ã¢ÂÂtraditional governmental functionÃ¢ÂÂ and hence did not enjoy constitutional immunity, under National League of Cities, from the *Supp. 33requirements of the Railway Labor Act. (Id., at p. 685 [71 L.Ed.2d at p. 553].) Based on this holding the Supreme Court in Garcia vacated the district courtÃ¢ÂÂs judgment and remanded for further consideration in light of Long Island. (457 U.S. 1102 [73 L.Ed.2d 1309, 102 S.Ct. 2897].) The district court adhered to its original position, finding that historically Congress had established a longstanding federal interest and regulatory presence in the railway industry in contrast to the only recent involvement of the federal government in establishing wages of public mass transit employees, and that the pattern of state regulation of mass transit gave rise to an inference of state sovereignty in the field within the meaning of National League of Cities. (San Antonio Met. Transit Authority v. Donovan (W.D.Tex. 1983) 557 F.Supp. 445.) The Secretary and Garcia again appealed to the Supreme Court.
Initially the court stated that under the summary of National League of Cities contained in Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Recl. Assn. (1981) 452 U.S. 264 [69 L.Ed.2d 1, 101 S.Ct. 2352], four conditions had to be satisfied before a state activity could be deemed immune under the Tenth Amendment from a particular federal regulation under the commerce clause. Ã¢ÂÂFirst, it is said that the federal statute at issue must regulate Ã¢ÂÂthe Ã¢ÂÂStates as States.Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ Second, the statute must Ã¢ÂÂaddress matters that are indisputably Ã¢ÂÂattribute[s] of state sovereignty.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ Third, state compliance with the federal obligation must Ã¢ÂÂdirectly impair [the StatesÃ¢ÂÂ] ability Ã¢ÂÂto structure integral operations in areas of traditional governmental functions.Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ [Fourth], the relation of state and federal interests must not be such that Ã¢ÂÂthe nature of the federal interest . . . justifies state submission.Ã¢ÂÂ [Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Recl. Assn., supra,] 452 US, at pp. 287-288, and n. 29 . . . quoting National League of Cities, 426 US, at 845, 852, 854 . . . .Ã¢ÂÂ (Garcia, supra, 469 U.S. 528 [83 L.Ed.2d at p. 1025].) The Supreme Court pointed out the difficulty in utilizing an historical analysis in defining the scope of the governmental functions deemed protected under National League of Cities. (Garcia, supra, 469 U.S. 528 [83 L.Ed.2d at p. 1026].) The Garcia majority believed that reliance on history as the organizing principle of state immunity under the Tenth Amendment would force the court to Ã¢ÂÂdecide by fiat precisely how longstanding a pattern of state involvement had to be for federal regulatory authority to be defeatedÃ¢ÂÂ (Id., at p. Ã¢ÂÂ [83 L.Ed.2d at pp. 1029-1030]), and prevented a court Ã¢ÂÂfrom accommodating changes in the historical functions of states.Ã¢ÂÂ (Id., at p. Ã¢ÂÂ [83 L.Ed.2d at p. 1029].) Indeed the court recognized that: Ã¢ÂÂthe existence vel non of a tradition of federal involvement in a particular area does not provide an adequate standard for state immunity. Most of the Federal GovernmentÃ¢ÂÂs current regulatory activity originated less than 50 years ago with the New Deal, and a good portion of it has developed within the last two decades. The recent vintage of this regulatory activity does not diminish the *Supp. 34strength of the federal interest in applying regulatory standards to state activities, nor does it affect the strength of the StatesÃ¢ÂÂ interest in being free from federal supervision.Ã¢ÂÂ (Id., at p. Ã¢ÂÂ [83 L.Ed.2d at p. 1030, fn. 10].) The court accordingly rejected National League as the standard for determining when congressional regulatory enactments under the commerce clause exceed CongressÃ¢ÂÂ constitutional authority. The court stated that the Constitution as a document recognizes the dual sovereignty of the federal and state governments but in only rare exceptions, Ã¢ÂÂlike the guarantee, in Article IV, section 3 of state territorial integrity, . . . carve[s] out express elements of state sovereignty that Congress may not employ its delegated powers to displace.Ã¢ÂÂ (Id., at p. Ã¢ÂÂ [83 L.Ed.2d at p. 1033).) The court reasoned that the parameters of state sovereignty should therefore be found Ã¢ÂÂin the shape of the constitutional scheme rather than in predetermined notions of sovereign power.Ã¢ÂÂ (Id., at p. Ã¢ÂÂ [83 L.Ed.2d at p. 1033].) The constitutional scheme as defended by the courts is one in which the principle limitations on federal authority are those Ã¢ÂÂinherent in the delegated nature of CongressÃ¢ÂÂ Article I powers . . . [and] the structure of the Federal Government itself.Ã¢ÂÂ (Id., at p. Ã¢ÂÂ [83 L.Ed.2d at p. 1034].) The court said; Ã¢ÂÂ[T]he principle and basic limit on the federal commerce power is that inherent in all congressional actionÃ¢ÂÂthe built-in restraints that our system provides through state participation in federal governmental action. The political process ensures that laws that unduly burden the States will not be promulgated.Ã¢ÂÂ (Id., at p. Ã¢ÂÂ [83 L.Ed.2d at p. 1037].) The majority therefore envisioned state influence in Congress through popular election of members of the House of Representatives, equal representation of the states in the United States Senate, and over the Presidency by state control over electoral qualifications in presidential elections as the means relied upon by the Framers to Ã¢ÂÂinsulate the interest of States.Ã¢ÂÂ (Id., at p. Ã¢ÂÂ [83 L.Ed.2d at p. 1034).) The court noted that the effectiveness of the political process in preserving statesÃ¢ÂÂ interest is apparent in the statesÃ¢ÂÂ success in securing large federal appropriations for various state and local activities and in exempting themselves from a wide variety of obligations imposed by Congress under the commerce clause.
Thus, the court reasoned; Ã¢ÂÂ[a]ny substantive restraint on the exercise of Commerce Clause powers must find its justification in the procedural nature of this basic limitation, and it must be tailored to compensate for possible failings in the national political process rather than to dictate a Ã¢ÂÂsacred province of state autonomy.Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ (Id., at p. Ã¢ÂÂ [83 L.Ed.2d at p. 1036], quoting EEOC v. Wyoming (1983) 460 U.S. 226, 236 [75 L.Ed.2d 18, 29, 103 S.Ct. 1054].) Finding that the states have secured substantial federal funding for their public mass transit systems the court concluded that CongressÃ¢ÂÂ exercise of its commerce clause power had significantly enhanced state func*Supp. 35tioning in the area and that Ã¢ÂÂthe internal safeguards of the political process ha[d] performed as intended.Ã¢ÂÂ (Id., at p. Ã¢ÂÂ [83 L.Ed.2d at p. 1037].)
Whether under the test of National League of Cities or the principles of Garcia it is clear that neither CaliforniaÃ¢ÂÂs Ã¢ÂÂability to structure integral operations in areas of traditional governmental functionsÃ¢ÂÂ nor its autonomy in the federal system has been unduly infringed in this instance. Here, as in Garcia, state autonomy has been protected by the stateÃ¢ÂÂs success in securing large money grants for local highway systems. Congress also made provisions for carrying the cost of implementation on federal shoulders by placing no financial burden on the state in administering the national speed limit.
Further, the Federal-Aid Highway Act declares the federal policy that: Ã¢ÂÂThe authorization of the appropriation of Federal funds or their availability for expenditure under this chapter shall in no way infringe on the sovereign rights of the States to determine which projects shall be federally financed. The provisions of this chapter provide for a federally assisted State program.Ã¢ÂÂ (23 U.S.C. ÃÂ§ 145.)
It is apparent that the states have been successful in limiting federal regulatory authority over state and local highway systems, including the local speed laws. The federal regulation is narrowly tailored to its specific purpose to conserve the nationÃ¢ÂÂs fossil fuel and does not unduly infringe upon state authority to establish speed limits on its highways. Indeed the public health and welfare of the state is enhanced by the reduced speed limit both in terms of fuel economy and reduced traffic fatalities. The type of federal intrusion into state decision making power at issue is minimal. Notably, it is not the State of California who has objected to this statute. It is not the state who complains that it has been coerced to give up its sovereignty. When California adopted the statutes currently in effect it recognized fuel conservation and safety as important purposes of the statutes. Does not California also have an interest in fuel conservation (consider the impact of fuel reserves and the need for off-shore oil drilling) or in public safety? When California, for valid reasons, chooses to adopt the national policy, is this illegal coercion? Respondent has failed to identify what state or local interest California has in a maximum speed limit above 55 miles per hour.
The trial court found that Congress lacked power to regulate motor vehicle speed on noninterstate highways under the commerce clause. Although we question the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs conclusion, having found that congressional power exists under the Ã¢ÂÂspending power,Ã¢ÂÂ we need not reach that issue. Suffice it to say that in this instance there appears to be a clear basis for Congress to have concluded that reduction in the speeds of automobile travel would conserve fuel, decrease the demand on the nationÃ¢ÂÂs fossil fuel supply *Supp. 36and improve traffic safety. The Federal Energy Administration had determined that over five million gallons of fuel had been saved daily due to reduction in speeds and travel on highways. (1974 U.S. Code Cong. & Admin. News, op. cit. supra, at p. 8019.) A 20 percent drop in traffic fatalities had also been realized. (Ibid.)  The United States Supreme Court has made clear that Ã¢ÂÂ[e]ven activity that is purely intrastate in character may be regulated by Congress, where the activity, combined with like conduct by others similarly situated, affects commerce among the States or with foreign nations.Ã¢ÂÂ (Fry v. U.S. (1975) 421 U.S. 542, 547 [44 L.Ed.2d 363, 368, 95 S.Ct. 1792].) Similarly the combined effect of individuals operating motor vehicles upon intrastate highways has a significant effect on the nationÃ¢ÂÂs fuel consumption. Regulation of motor vehicle speed is a reasonable method of controlling these national problems. Notwithstanding the fact that local land use was a matter traditionally of local concern, the court determined that Congress had a rational basis for its conclusion that surface coal mining, with its concomitant environmental hazards throughout the nation and effect on the economy, affected interstate commerce. (Model v. Virginia Surface Mining & Recl. Assn., supra, 452 U.S. at pp. 277-282 [69 L.Ed.2d at pp. 16-20, 101 S.Ct. 2352]; see Friends of Earth v. Carey (2d Cir. 1977) 552 F.2d 25.)
Conclusion
For the reasons stated above we find the provisions of section 154 of title 23 of the United States Code (the Emergency Highway Energy Conservation Act. [Pub. L. No. 93-239, 87 Stat. 1046]), are an appropriate exercise of CongressÃ¢ÂÂ authority under the spending clause, that this authority is not limited by the Tenth Amendment, and that the California Legislature did not impermissibly delegate its legislative power in adopting a 55-mile-per-hour speed limit. The judgment of the trial court is therefore reversed.

Opinion
COOPERMAN, P. J.
Defendant Ronald Wilson appeals from a judgment of conviction following a jury trial at which time he was found guilty as charged in count I of a misdemeanor complaint with violating Vehicle Code section 23152, subdivision (a) (driving under the influence of an alcoholic beverage).1
The reporterÃ¢ÂÂs transcript of the trial proceedings reflects the following evidence:
California Highway Patrol Officer Jerelyn Albers and her partner, Officer Miranda, were on patrol on the 60 Freeway, in uniform and in a marked Highway Patrol vehicle, on September 15, 1983, at 3 a.m. At that time Officer Albers saw a vehicle Ã¢ÂÂparked on the shoulder ÃÂ¡t an angle on the shoulder with the left rear portion of the vehicle partially into the No. 3 lane and the lights were all on.Ã¢ÂÂ The officers pulled in behind the parked vehicle and upon illuminating its interior they observed one person in the vehicle.
Officer Albers approached the parked vehicle and as she did so she noticed that its engine was running, the vehicle was in park and the air conditioner was running. Upon approaching the vehicle, Officer Albers saw defendant behind the wheel and asleep. To avoid the possibility of an accident, Officer Albers opened the vehicle door and turned off the engine before awakening defendant.
After awakening defendant, Officer Albers asked him to exit the vehicle. When he exited his vehicle, defendant walked right into the middle of the traffic lane. Officer Albers had to grab him and pull him back. The officer noted an odor of an alcoholic beverage about defendantÃ¢ÂÂs person. Defendant *Supp. 4also exhibited other symptoms of intoxication, including slurred speech, disorientation, and bloodshot, watery eyes.
When Officer Albers felt that defendant was completely awake, she asked him some questions. She asked defendant if he had been drinking. He answered in the affirmative. In response to further questions, defendant said he did not know how much he had to drink but said that he began drinking about 7 p.m. and stopped about 10 p.m. Further response from defendant indicated that he was disoriented as to time and location. Defendant said that he was Ã¢ÂÂoutÃ¢ÂÂ approximately two hours. Apparently, defendant did not know how long he had been asleep but felt that he had been driving about two hours. The vehicle belonged to defendant. He further indicated that there was nothing mechanically wrong with his vehicle. The location of defendantÃ¢ÂÂs vehicle was approximately one and a half miles from the nearest onramp.
Defendant was asked to perform a series of field sobriety tests. Officer Albers formed the opinion that defendant was under the influence of an alcoholic beverage based on his poor performance of those tests, the odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from him and the other symptoms of intoxication he had exhibited.
Cynthia Wilson, defendantÃ¢ÂÂs ex-wife, testified that she had dinner with defendant on the evening preceding his arrest and that between about 6:30 p.m. and about 9 or 10 p.m. defendant drank two beers. He left her apartment about 11 p.m. Wilson said defendantÃ¢ÂÂs vehicle overheated but she did not recall defendant complaining about the vehicle overheating that evening.
Defendant testified in his own behalf. The substance of his testimony concerning what transpired until he left the company of his ex-wife was the same as her testimony. He then testified that he left his ex-wifeÃ¢ÂÂs apartment between 11 and 11:30 p.m. and drove around for about two hours because he was lost. During his drive, defendant stopped to purchase cigarettes and at that time bought a six-pack of beer. His vehicle overheated on the freeway and defendant pulled over to the side.
Defendant testified that he probably did not do well on the field sobriety tests for the following reasons: He was tired. He also had a back problem. Moreover, he wore his glasses during the finger-to-nose test although tie is not supposed to wear his glasses for close work. Additionally, the spotlights of the police vehicle were shining in his eyes.
After defendant stopped by the side of the freeway he put on his flasher lights. A truck stopped and the driver, who was drinking a beer, offered to *Supp. 5help defendant. Defendant declined the offer. The driver then asked defendant if he wanted a beer. Defendant declined the offer of the truck driver and, instead, he gave the truck driver a beer. The truck driver and defendant each had about three beers and then the truck driver left.
About an hour and a half later, when his vehicle cooled down, defendant tried to start it, but he was unsuccessful. He had turned on his vehicle lights so he could see where to add coolant to the radiator and fell asleep at the wheel. Defendant stated that his vehicle heater was on, not the air conditioner. Defendant thought the officer believed the air conditioner was on because there was not enough fluid in the vehicle radiator to cause hot air to come out of the heater.
Defendant testified that when he began drinking beer by the side of the freeway, he had assumed he would not be able to drive and was planning on calling his roommate at 6 a.m. Defendant also testified that he told Officer Albers about his back problem. She did not ask him if he was having vehicle trouble.
Defendant conceded that he did not do well on the tests in part because of the effects of the beer.
DefendantÃ¢ÂÂs position on appeal is threefold: (1) Vehicle Code section 23152, subdivision (a), is unconstitutionally vague for the reason that the word Ã¢ÂÂdrive,Ã¢ÂÂ specifically its derivative, Ã¢ÂÂdriving,Ã¢ÂÂ fails to give a person adequate notice of what is proscribed; (2) The trial court committed reversible error by failing to instruct on the definition of Ã¢ÂÂdrivingÃ¢ÂÂ; and (3) There is insufficient evidence to show that defendant had been Ã¢ÂÂdrivingÃ¢ÂÂ while under the influence.
We find no merit to defendantÃ¢ÂÂs position and affirm.
Initially, we reject defendantÃ¢ÂÂs contention that the word Ã¢ÂÂdriveÃ¢ÂÂ as used in Vehicle Code section 23152, subdivision (a)2 is impermissibly vague.  Ã¢ÂÂA statute or ordinance violates fundamental due process if it requires or prohibits the doing of an act with such vagueness that a person of common intelligence must guess at its meaning. It must be sufficiently definite to provide a standard of conduct, or notice, and a standard for ascertaining guilt. (Bowland v. Municipal Court (1976) 18 Cal.3d 479, 491 [134 Cal.Rptr. 630, 556 P.2d 1081]; People v. Barksdale (1972) 8 Cal.3d *Supp. 6320, 327 [105 Cal.Rptr. 1, 503 P.2d 257].) However, a statute is presumed valid and courts will uphold it Ã¢ÂÂif its terms may be made reasonably certain by reference to other definable sources.Ã¢ÂÂ (People v. Superior Court Hartway) (1977) 19 Cal.3d 338, 345 [138 Cal.Rptr. 66, 562 P.2d 1315].) (People v. Katrinak (1982) 136 Cal.App.3d 145, 156 [185 Cal.Rptr. 869].)
Such sources include the dictionary definition of the word or phrase in question. (Ibid.) In this context, WebsterÃ¢ÂÂs Third New International Dictionary (1976) defines the transitive verb Ã¢ÂÂto driveÃ¢ÂÂ as meaning Ã¢ÂÂto operate the mechanism and controls and direct the course of (. . .a motor vehicle . . .).Ã¢ÂÂ (Id., at p. 692.) Moreover, the noun Ã¢ÂÂdrivingÃ¢ÂÂ is defined as the Ã¢ÂÂmanagement of an automobile or other vehicle on the road.Ã¢ÂÂ (Ibid.)
From the foregoing, we conclude that a reasonable person would construe the phrase Ã¢ÂÂto drive a vehicleÃ¢ÂÂ in subdivision (a) of section 23152 of the Vehicle Code as encompassing any act or action which is necessary to operate the mechanism and controls and direct the course of a motor vehicle. As construed by reference to the dictionary definitions, the word Ã¢ÂÂdriveÃ¢ÂÂ and its derivatives are not constitutionally infirm for vagueness. (See also People v. Jordan (1977) 75 Cal.App.3d Supp. 1, 8 [142 Cal.Rptr. 401].)
We next reject defendantÃ¢ÂÂs related contention that the trial court committed reversible error by refusing to instruct the jury on the definition of Ã¢ÂÂdriving.Ã¢ÂÂ
Ã¢ÂÂThe language of a statute defining a crime or defense is generally an appropriate and desirable basis for an instruction .... If the jury would have no difficulty in understanding the statute without guidance, the court need do no more than instruct in the statutory language. [Citations.]Ã¢ÂÂ (People v. Jones (1971) 19 Cal.App.3d 437, 447 [96 Cal.Rptr. 795].) Ã¢ÂÂOrdinary words and phrases in statutes require no definition because they are presumed to be understood by jurors. [Citations.]Ã¢ÂÂ (People v. Stewart (1979) 89 CaI.App.3d 992, 999 [153 Cal.Rptr. 242].)
In the present case the court instructed the jury pursuant to CALJIC No. 16.830 (rev.ed. 1981), which defines the offense in question in the language of Vehicle Code section 23152, subdivision (a). The record reflects that there was no request from the jury for clarification or explanation in this regard. Accordingly, we conclude that it was not error for the court to refuse to instruct the jury concerning the definition of the word Ã¢ÂÂdriveÃ¢ÂÂ or its derivative, Ã¢ÂÂdriving,Ã¢ÂÂ which are words in common usage and are ordinarily understood.
*Supp. 7We also reject defendantÃ¢ÂÂs remaining contention that there was insufficient evidence to establish that he had been Ã¢ÂÂdrivingÃ¢ÂÂ or that he had been intoxicated at the time of driving.
Ã¢ÂÂThe question as to whether defendant drove the vehicle is a question of fact for the jury (People v. Quarles, 123 Cal.App.2d 1 [266 P.2d 68]) .... An appellate court will assume every fact and inference which the trier of fact could reasonably have deduced from the evidence (People v. Powell, 187 Cal.App.2d 709, 712 [10 Cal.Rptr. 116]) .... Ã¢ÂÂOn appeal the evidence and inference must be viewed in a light most favorable to the respondent. ... To warrant reversal, it must be made clearly to appear that, on no hypothesis, is there sufficient substantial evidence to support the conclusion of the lower court.Ã¢ÂÂ (People v. Moseley 240 Cal.App.2d 859, 863 [50 Cal.Rptr. 67], citing cases.)Ã¢ÂÂ (People v. Hanggi (1968) 265 Cal.App.2d Supp. 969, 971-972 [70 Cal.Rptr. 540].)
The defendant in Hanggi, as the defendant here, urged that there was insufficient evidence to support a finding that he had been Ã¢ÂÂdriving.Ã¢ÂÂ In rejecting that contention, the Hanggi court announced: Ã¢ÂÂ. . . we conclude that there was ample evidence from which the jury could have inferred that the defendant had been driving his vehicle on the public highway at a time when he was intoxicated. From the combination of circumstancesÃ¢ÂÂdefendantÃ¢ÂÂs sitting in a vehicle in the center of the streetÃ¢ÂÂbehind the wheel-engine runningÃ¢ÂÂlights on, it can be inferred that defendant must have placed himself in such position, and that he accomplished this by driving the car to the place at which he was found. Defendant suggests various possibilities, such as a friend driving the car to the place where found and the defendant thereafter replacing him, but unable to drive further. He also suggests the possibility that defendant had been visiting in the area, had too much to drink, got into the car intending to drive but was unable to go further. It seems unlikely that in either situation the car would have been left parked in the middle of the street, straddling the traffic lanes and facing generally at right angles to the street. Suffice it to say that the jury apparently discarded these possibilities as being unreasonable and adopted the more likely deduction that defendant had driven himself to the area and was then unable to continue.Ã¢ÂÂ (Id., at p. 972; cf. People v. Nelson (1983) 140 Cal.App.3d Supp. 1, 3-4 [189 Cal.Rptr. 845]; People v. Kelly (1937) 27 Cal.App.2d Supp. 771, 773 [70 P.2d 276].)
Similarly, we also conclude that there is substantial evidence from which the jury here could have inferred that: (1) It was defendant who drove the vehicle on the public highway to where it was stopped; and (2) defendant was intoxicated at the time.
*Supp. 8Although the vehicle was in the Ã¢ÂÂparkÃ¢ÂÂ gear with Ã¢ÂÂthe brakes . . . on,Ã¢ÂÂ the vehicle was stopped partly on the shoulder of the 60 Freeway at an angle with its left rear portion partially intruding into the No. 3 lane. Clearly, this was not a normal parking place or position for a vehicle to be stopped. Moreover, the vehicle did not simply materialize at that location. Obviously, someone drove it there.
That someone was defendant, according to the jury. Defendant was the sole occupant of the vehicle. He was found seated in the driverÃ¢ÂÂs seat. At no time did he claim that anyone else had driven the vehicle to that location, and the vehicle belonged to defendant.
There is abundant evidence in the record that defendant had been drinking prior to his stopping the vehicle on the shoulder of the freeway. Also, his disorientation and poor performance of the field sobriety tests constitute ample evidence from which the jury could infer that his driving ability was impaired.
We disagree with defendantÃ¢ÂÂs assertion that there can be no conviction for driving under the influence unless there was at least a Ã¢ÂÂslight movementÃ¢ÂÂ of the vehicle in question at the time the officers confronted defendant. Defendant misapprehends the context in which the issue of a Ã¢ÂÂslight movementÃ¢ÂÂ of the vehicle arises.
As a general rule, a peace officer can only make a lawful warrantless arrest for a misdemeanor offense if he has reasonable cause to believe that it is being committed in his presence.3 (Pen. Code, ÃÂ§ 836, subd. (1).) With regard to the offense of driving under the influence of an alcoholic beverage or drug (Veh. Code ÃÂ§ 23152, subd. (a)), a Ã¢ÂÂslight movementÃ¢ÂÂ of the vehicle in the officerÃ¢ÂÂs presence has been a determinative factor in concluding whether or not a defendant was Ã¢ÂÂdrivingÃ¢ÂÂ in the presence of the officer. (Henslee v. DMV (1985) 168 Cal.App.3d 445, 450-453 [214 Cal.Rptr. 249]; see also People v. Engleman (1981) 116 Cal.App.3d Supp. 14, 18-20 [172 Cal.Rptr. 474].) In other words, a Ã¢ÂÂslight movementÃ¢ÂÂ of the vehicle constitutes direct evidence that the vehicle was being Ã¢ÂÂdriven.Ã¢ÂÂ (Cf. People v. Kelley, supra, 27 Cal.App.2d Supp. 771, 772-774.)
*Supp. 9On the other hand, where the sufficiency of the evidence to support the judgment is in question, as contrasted with the validity of a defendantÃ¢ÂÂs arrest,4 it is clear that the existence of evidence establishing a Ã¢ÂÂslight movementÃ¢ÂÂ of the vehicle does not present a problem.5 In the absence of such direct evidence of Ã¢ÂÂdrivingÃ¢ÂÂ, the element of Ã¢ÂÂdrivingÃ¢ÂÂ may nonetheless be established at trial through circumstantial evidence, which is the case here. (People v. Hanggi, supra, 265 Cal.App.2d Supp. at p. 972; People v. Garcia (1983) 149 Cal.App.3d Supp. 50, 53-54 [197 Cal.Rptr. 277]; see Burg v. Municipal Court (1983) 35 Cal.3d 257, fn. 10 [198 Cal.Rptr. 145, 673 P.2d 732]; see also People v. Smith (1967) 253 Cal.App.2d 711, 714-715 [61 Cal.Rptr. 557].)
DefendantÃ¢ÂÂs assertion that there is insufficient evidence to show that he was intoxicated while driving is grounded in his version of the facts. In other words, he claims that he was sober at the time he was driving and stopped his vehicle, since the alcoholic beverages he had consumed earlier had already dissipated, and that his intoxicated state when confronted by the officers two hours later was due to the beer he had consumed after having stopped his vehicle. The jury obviously disbelieved his version, which it was entitled to do, in finding him guilty of driving under the influence of an alcoholic beverage. We cannot reweigh credibility on appeal. (People v. French (1978) 77 Cal.App.3d 511, 523 [143 Cal.Rptr. 782].
The judgment is affirmed.
Bernstein, J., and Shabo, J., concurred.

 Prior to trial defendant admitted to having suffered a prior conviction of that offense. Apparently, count II, which charged defendant with a violation of Vehicle Code section 23152, subdivision (b) (driving with a .10 percent or more blood alcohol level) was dismissed.


 Subdivision (a) of that section reads: Ã¢ÂÂIt is unlawful for any person who is under the influence of an alcoholic beverage or any drug, or under the combined influence of an alcoholic beverage and any drug, to drive a vehicle.Ã¢ÂÂ


 The two statutory exceptions are set out in Vehicle Code section 40300.5, which reads: Ã¢ÂÂNotwithstanding any other provision of law, a peace officer may, without a warrant, arrest a person who is (1) involved in a traffic accident or (2) observed by the peace officer in or about a vehicle which is obstructing a roadway, when the officer has reasonable cause to believe that the person had been driving while under the influence of an alcoholic beverage or any drug, or under the combined influence of an alcoholic beverage and any drug.Ã¢ÂÂ The second exception above would appear to be applicable to the facts here. However, that exception was not added until after the date of defendantÃ¢ÂÂs arrest, and thus, is not applicable. (See Stats. 1984, ch. 722, ÃÂ§ 1, pp.---.)


 Defendant does not challenge the legality of his arrest. Accordingly, that issue is not before us. Parenthetically, we point out that the only sanction involved where the arrest is established as being illegal, e.g., the offense was not committed in the officerÃ¢ÂÂs presence, is the suppression of evidence, such as a chemical test, obtained following the arrest. {People v. Engleman, supra, 116 Cal.App.3d at pp. Supp. 19-20. People v. Jordan, supra, 75 Cal.App.3d at pp. Supp. 13-14.)


 Although the court in Jordan, supra, announced that Ã¢ÂÂ[t]o warrant conviction only slight movement is necessary ...Ã¢ÂÂ {Id., at p. Supp. 8), we conclude that the Jordan court misspoke. The Jordan case involved a PeopleÃ¢ÂÂs appeal challenging the lower courtÃ¢ÂÂs order suppressing evidence of the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs chemical test on the basis that defendant had not been Ã¢ÂÂdrivingÃ¢ÂÂ a Ã¢ÂÂmotor vehicleÃ¢ÂÂ. Defendant had not been convicted as of the time the appeal was taken.

Opinion
CANTER, J.
The City of Santa Barbara (City) appeals from an order of the Municipal Court of Santa Barbara County, South Coast Judicial District (Municipal Court) sustaining a demurrer to prosecutions brought pursuant to section 15.16.085 of the Santa Barbara Municipal Code, the CityÃ¢ÂÂs sleeping ordinance, and holding that section unconstitutional.
Facts
A rather large number of cases were consolidated in the MunicipÃÂ¡l Court for hearing on a common demurrer. Some 55 individuals were given 84 citations for violations of either the CityÃ¢ÂÂs camping ordinance (ÃÂ§ 15.16.070 of the municipal code)1 which prohibits camping in certain areas, or of the CityÃ¢ÂÂs sleeping ordinance (ÃÂ§ 15.16.085 of the municipal code) which prohibits sleeping in certain areas and at certain times. After the hearing on the demurrer, the Municipal Court issued a written decision and order. The camping ordinance was upheld, and apparently those prosecutions have proceeded to finality, no appeal having been taken from that order. The sleeping ordinance, however, was declared unconstitutional. This decision affected 38 of the citations. The City appeals. We reverse.
Contentions
The City contends the Municipal Court departed from established constitutional principles in finding the ordinance overbroad in a case where there *Supp. 13was no assertion of engagement in constitutionally protected activity; in using hypothetical applications of the ordinance where no impairment of First Amendment or fundamental rights was alleged; and, in considering only one possible purpose of the ordinance in determining whether it satisfies the rational relationship.
Discussion
The sleeping ordinance, section 15.16.085 of the Santa Barbara Municipal Code, provides as follows: Ã¢ÂÂIt shall be unlawful for any person to sleep in: H] (1) Any public park during the period of time from 10:00 P.M. to 6:00 A.M.; [1] (2) Any public street; [|] (3) Any public parking lot or public area, improved or unimproved; or [1] (4) Any public beach during the period of time from 10:00 P.M. to 6:00 A.M.Ã¢ÂÂ
In finding the ordinance unconstitutional, the Municipal Court relied upon two Florida cases, City of Pompano Beach v. Capalbo (Fla.App. 1984) 455 So.2d 468, and State v. Penley (Fla.App. 1973) 276 So.2d 180. While the ordinances struck down by the Florida courts bear similarities to the Santa Barbara ordinance, there is ample and compelling California authority to uphold its validity.
In Batts v. Superior Court (1972) 23 Cal.App.3d 435 [100 Cal.Rptr. 181], a Newport Beach police officer observed a van parked in a public parking lot. Suspecting the occupants of violating a city ordinance prohibiting sleeping in an automobile parked in any place in the City or sleeping on the beach between the hours of 9 p.m. and 9 a.m., the officer made contact with the occupants and discovered contraband leading to a felony arrest. The court did not question the validity of the ordinance in upholding the officerÃ¢ÂÂs actions. On the contrary, it held: Ã¢ÂÂOne of the tools the city uses in maintaining some semblance of control is the ordinance which provides that no one may sleep in an automobile or on the beach between the hours of 9:00 p.m. and 9:00 a.m. . . . [H]e had reason to believe that even if the occupants were not asleep at that time, they did intend to remain in the parking lot and sleep. Accordingly, he had the duty of notifying the occupants that an ordinance prohibited their doing so.Ã¢ÂÂ (Id., at p. 439.) The outcome of this case is contrary to the Florida case, State v. Penley, supra, 276 So.2d 180, relied upon by the Municipal Court. There the officer discovered a concealed pistol after arresting Penley for sleeping on a bus-stop bench. The Florida court found the sleeping ordinance unconstitutionally vague and the arrest pursuant thereto unlawful.
*Supp. 14Ferrell v. City of Santa Monica (1972) 26 Cal.App.3d 374 [102 Cal.Rptr. 705] involved a civil suit for injuries suffered when plaintiff was run over by a beach-cleaning machine while he was sleeping on the beach in violation of a Santa Monica city ordinance. A jury awarded plaintiff damages. The cityÃ¢ÂÂs motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict was denied by the trial court. The Court of Appeal reversed holding that plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs violation of the city ordinance prohibiting loitering or sleeping on the beach between midnight and 5 a.m. established plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs contributory negligence as a matter of law. The validity of the ordinance was not questioned.
Where the constitutionality of an analogous ordinance has been called into question, its validity was upheld. The court in People v. Trantham (1984) 161 Cal.App.3d Supp. 1, 6 [208 Cal.Rptr. 535], held that a Los Angeles ordinance providing that, Ã¢ÂÂNo person shall enter, remain, stay or loiter in any park between the hours of 10:30 oÃ¢ÂÂclock p.m. and 5:00 oÃ¢ÂÂclock a.m.Ã¢ÂÂ was not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad. The analysis set forth therein is persuasive: Ã¢ÂÂ[Generally speaking, late night park closure regulations pass constitutional muster as valid exercises of municipal power to restrict the use of a municipalityÃ¢ÂÂs public facilities regarding reasonable time, place, and manner limitations, [f] . . . Specifically, we find that its proscription against anyone entering, remaining, staying, or loitering in any park during the late night hours in question is not void for vagueness or overbreadth. No overbreadth problem arises since the regulation does not possibly encompass innocent as well as criminal conduct inasmuch as its proscription against anyone going into or being in a park for any length of time during the specified time period applies across the board, which means that it is of no legal consequence if a person enters or is in the park for an innocent or criminal purpose. [Citation.] Moreover, no vagueness problem arises for the reasons that the regulation places a person on notice as to precisely what conduct is proscribed and the proscription itself leaves no room for the exercise of discretion by law enforcement officers as to the propriety of any particular personÃ¢ÂÂs presence in the park.Ã¢ÂÂ (Id., at p. Supp. 17.)
The Municipal Court found the ordinance constitutionally defective as overbroad. But, as the city attorney correctly points out, the doctrine of Ã¢ÂÂoverbreadthÃ¢ÂÂ of a statute is inapplicable to cases not involving First Amendment rights. There is a Ã¢ÂÂgeneral rule that constitutional adjudication requires a review of the application of a statute to the conduct of the party before the Court, [f] Subsequently, however, the Court did recognize an exception to this general rule for laws that are written so broadly that they may inhibit the constitutionally protected speech of third parties.Ã¢ÂÂ (City Council v. Taxpayers for Vincent (1984) 466 U.S. 789, 798 [80 L.Ed.2d 772, 782, 104 S.Ct. 2118, 2125].)
*Supp. 15While under some circumstances, sleeping Ã¢ÂÂmay be expressive and part of the message delivered by the demonstration,Ã¢ÂÂ Clark v. Community for Creative Non-Violence (1984) 468 U.S. 288, 294 [82 L.Ed.2d 221, 227, 104 S.Ct. 3065, 3069], it nonetheless is subjectable to time, place and manner restrictions. (Id., at p. 294 [82 L.Ed.2d at p. 228].) There is no implication in the present case that the defendants were engaged in any demonstration to which sleeping could possibly be appended as expressive conduct. Rather it is clear that the sleeping to which this ordinance was directed was of the general kind, which enjoys no peculiar constitutional advantage. As the Clark case points out, the government can constitutionally prohibit overnight sleeping in public areas as part of its broad police powers.
Ã¢ÂÂIn a facial challenge to the overbreadth and vagueness of a law, a courtÃ¢ÂÂs first task is to determine whether the enactment reaches a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct. If it does not, then the overbreadth challenge must fail.  The court should then examine the facial vagueness challenge and, assuming the enactment implicates no constitutionally protected conduct, should uphold the challenge only if the enactment is impermissibly vague in all of its applications. ... A court should therefore examine the complainantÃ¢ÂÂs conduct before analyzing other hypothetical applications of the law.Ã¢ÂÂ (Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates (1982) 455 U.S. 489, 494-495, [71 L.Ed.2d 362, 369, 102 S.Ct. 1186, 1191] (italics added and fns. omitted.)  As in Hoffman Estates, the court Ã¢ÂÂin this case did not explicitly consider whether the ordinance reaches constitutionally protected conduct and is overbroad.Ã¢ÂÂ (Ibid.)
Indeed, as in Hoffman Estates, supra, the court did not explicitly consider Ã¢ÂÂwhether the ordinance is vague in all of its applications. Instead the court determined that the ordinance is void for vagueness because it is unclear in some of its applications to the conduct of [defendant] and of other hypothetical parties.Ã¢ÂÂ (455 U.S. at p. 495 [71 L.Ed.2d at p. 369, 102 S.Ct. at pp. 1119-1192].) The hypothetical applications engaged in by the Municipal Court, garnered from the Florida case of City of Pompano Beach, supra, 455 So.2d 468, do not meet the required scrutiny demanded of the situation by United States constitutional standards.
United States v. Hogue (9th Cir. 1985) 752 F.2d 1503, involved in actuality one of the hypotheticals criticized by the Florida court in City of Pompano Beach, supra, 455 So.2d at page 470, and adopted by the Municipal Court: the Ã¢ÂÂinebriated driver who has taken widely disseminated good counsel and chosen to go to sleep in his parked car rather than take his life or othersÃ¢ÂÂ lives in his hands.Ã¢ÂÂ Ms. Hogue was cited for sleeping off the effects of alcohol in a national park, in violation of a park regulation. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals noted that Ã¢ÂÂ[w]here speech is not the explicit *Supp. 16subject of a statute or regulation and is not otherwise implicated ... we need only examine the vagueness challenge under the facts of the particular case.Ã¢ÂÂ (Hogue, at p. 1504.)  With regard to the driverÃ¢ÂÂs dilemma which caused the Florida court in City of Pompano Beach, supra, to find vagueness, the Ninth Circuit held: Ã¢ÂÂThe law does not exonerate one who forces an election between evils and chooses the lesser of the two.Ã¢ÂÂ (Hogue, at p. 1505.) In such a situation, there is nothing vague about the officerÃ¢ÂÂs duty nor does the potentiality for dilemma detract from the fairness of the notice afforded the defendant. The same considerations when applied to the Santa Barbara ordinance yield the same result. While the Municipal Court felt the potentiality for such a dilemma rendered the ordinance unconstitutionally vague, the parked inebriated driver would be prosecutable under the CityÃ¢ÂÂs ordinance. The Santa Barbara police officer is not required to subjectively determine any factors about the violatorÃ¢ÂÂs status nor is the officer vested with complete discretion after encountering a violator. The sleeping ordinance is clear of discernment to both enforcer and violator, and is consequently not void for vagueness.
The preamble section of the ordinance which enacted section 15.16.085 to the city code enunciated the purpose of the ordinance as being the protection of the community from an increase in criminal behavior caused by the transient population. While noting that control of crime is a proper object for the exercise of the CityÃ¢ÂÂs police powers, the Municipal Court found that the ordinance did not bear a reasonable relationship to the crime control objective because criminals do not commit crimes in their sleep. The Municipal Court could not find a nexus between the inactivity resulting from sleeping and criminality. This rather narrow view of the ordinance ignores many other legitimate purposes served by the ordinance. Among those legitimate purposes which do connect the purpose of the ordinance to the prohibited activity is the interest the City has in protecting the sleeping transient as victim rather than as culprit. This purpose is recognized as a legitimate exercise of police power in the inebriated motorist case, United States v. Hogue: Ã¢ÂÂHogue, her abilities substantially impaired from alcohol, was alone in a national park at night . . . asleep in a vehicle with an open window, not within a designated campground or shelter. That conduct constitute[d] the violation punishable under the regulation. In her vulnerable condition, Hogue could neither defend herself against humans or animals, . . . The law acts reasonably in prohibiting the creation of such a risk in the confines of a national park.Ã¢ÂÂ (Hogue, supra, 752 F.2d at p. 1505.) Likewise, the City acts reasonably in lessening the risks to transients from other transients by restricting the areas where overnight sleeping, and thus vulnerability, can legitimately take place. Among others, this purpose formed a reasonable relation to the proscribed activity. Additional valid purposes need not be catalogued here.
*Supp. 17The order appealed from is reversed and the case is remanded to the Municipal Court with directions to overrule the demurrer.
Adams, P. J., and Stevens, J.,* concurred.
The United States Supreme Court denied a petition for writ of certiorari on April 28, 1986.

 Section 15.16.070 provides as follows: Ã¢ÂÂIt shall be unlawful for any person to camp in the following areas except as otherwise provided for: (1) Any public park; (2) Any public street; (3) Any public parking lot or public area, improved, or unimproved; (4) Any public beach between a point representing the prolongation of the easterly city limits as they existed prior to May 31, 1957, and a point representing the prolongation of La Marina Drive.Ã¢ÂÂ

Opinion
COOPERMAN, P. J.
Defendant Rolando Ramirez appeals from an order denying his motion to vacate the entry of default and to set aside the default judgment taken against him.
 The thrust of his position is that both the entry of default and the default judgment are void for lack of jurisdiction.1 He reasserts the ground in his motion that the clerk was without jurisdiction to enter his default since he had in fact filed an answer to the complaint.2 He concludes that the judgment, which was based on that void entry of default, was therefore likewise void.  Alternatively, defendant urges, for the first time on appeal, that the court was without jurisdiction to render a default judgment since the complaint failed to specify the amount of damages being sought against defendant.3 (Code Civ. Proc., ÃÂ§ 580; Becker v. S.P.V. Construction Co. (1980) 27 Cal.3d 489, 493-494 [165 Cal.Rptr. 825, 612 P.2d 915].)
From our review of the record we find defendantÃ¢ÂÂs position to be without merit and affirm. The record, which consists solely of the clerkÃ¢ÂÂs transcript, reflects, in pertinent part, the following chronology:
On January 31, 1983, Charles and Dorothy Wisdom filed the complaint in question. It was served on defendant by personal service on February 3, 1983. Plaintiffs sought recovery of damages against defendant on various legal theories. However, from our examination of the pleading, it is clear that the gravamen of the complaint is the alleged violations of Civil Code *Supp. 5section 789.3.4 The complaint essentially charged defendant landlord with unlawfully removing the front door, stove, sink, and refrigerator of plaintiffsÃ¢ÂÂ apartment in an attempt to evict plaintiffs constructively in retaliation for their action of withholding a portion of their rent as a means to enforce their rights to a habitable dwelling.
Paragraphs 7, 8, and 9 of the complaint, respectively, alleged:
Ã¢ÂÂ7. By reason of the foregoing unlawful acts of defendant, plaintiffs are entitled to damages pursuant to California Civil Code section 789.3 in the amount to be determined.5
Ã¢ÂÂ8. By reason of the aforementioned acts of defendant, plaintiffs obtained legal counsel and are entitled to reasonable attorneyÃ¢ÂÂs fees pursuant to California Civil Code section 789.3.6
Ã¢ÂÂ9. In doing the foregoing acts, defendants acted maliciously and without probable cause, and without regard for the rights, health and feelings of plaintiffs and with the intent of oppressing plaintiffs; said acts were done by defendants with the intent, design, and purpose on the part of defendants to injure plaintiffs; by reason thereof plaintiffs are entitled to exemplary and punitive damages in the amount of $15,000.Ã¢ÂÂ
The prayer of the complaint requested: Ã¢ÂÂ1. Damages in the amount to be determined; 2. Punitive damages in the amount of at least $15,000; 3. Reasonable attorneyÃ¢ÂÂs fees, if allowed by law; 4. For cost of suit; 5. For such other and further relief that the court deems just and proper.Ã¢ÂÂ It also stated: Ã¢ÂÂ6. Plaintiffs waive all amounts in excess of the courtÃ¢ÂÂs jurisdiction.Ã¢ÂÂ
*Supp. 6Also on January 31 the court granted plaintiffsÃ¢ÂÂ ex parte application for a temporary restraining order and an order to show cause re issuance of a preliminary injunction. Following a hearing on February 14, 1983, a preliminary injunction was issued against defendant and a codefendant, Ralph Ramirez. The minutes of the February 14 hearing reflects that defendant made no appearance. On March 1, 1983, however, a document entitled Ã¢ÂÂDeclaration (CCP ÃÂ§ÃÂ§ 527, 2015.5) by Defendant Opposing Application for Preliminary Injunction (CCP ÃÂ§ 527)Ã¢ÂÂ was filed on behalf of defendant by his attorney, albeit no motion to modify or dissolve the preliminary injunction was made.
No answer or other responsive pleading to the complaint was filed by defendant.7 On March 14, 1983, defendantÃ¢ÂÂs default was entered by the clerk pursuant to plaintiffsÃ¢ÂÂ request. The oral prove-up hearing for the award of damages was originally scheduled for July 25, 1983. Both that hearing and a subsequently scheduled hearing on August 17, 1983, however, were placed off calendar.
Following a hearing on September 28, 1983, a default judgment was entered by the court in favor of plaintiffs and against defendant and codefendant Ralph Ramirez in the total sum of $11,479.95, plus attorney fees in the sum of $1,250.
On March 12, 1984, defendant filed a motion to set aside the default and default judgment taken against him. Although the motion was accompanied by a declaration of merits, the declaration was not executed by defendant. Defendant proffered no evidence in support of the motion. Instead, he merely asserted in his points and authorities that the document entitled Ã¢ÂÂDeclaration by Defendant Opposing Application for Preliminary InjunctionÃ¢ÂÂ constituted the requisite responsive pleading necessary to avoid the entry of a default and subsequent default judgment against him.
In their opposition papers filed March 22, 1984, plaintiffs essentially took the view that a reasonable interpretation of the document in question established that it did not constitute an answer to the complaint.
On April 2, 1984, defendantÃ¢ÂÂs motion was denied. The minutes are silent concerning whether it was denied following a hearing and whether any party or his respective attorney was present when the motion was considered and denied.  Moreover, the court apparently issued no memo*Supp. 7randum of decision.8
                   Although the legal and factual basis for the courtÃ¢ÂÂs ruling is unknown, it is incumbent upon us to uphold the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs action if it is correct on any legal theory applicable to the case. (DÃ¢ÂÂAmico v. Board of Medical Examiners (1974) 11 Cal.3d 1, 18-19 [112 Cal.Rptr. 786, 520 P.2d 10].)
We first address defendantÃ¢ÂÂs contention that the judgment is void since the clerk was without jurisdiction to enter defendantÃ¢ÂÂs default. The authority of the clerk of a court to enter a default is expressly set out in Code of Civil Procedure section 585.9 In short, the clerk is authorized to enter a defendantÃ¢ÂÂs default when no responsive pleading, as enumerated in that section, has been filed. (But see Baske v. Burke (1981) 125 Cal.App.3d 38, 42, 45 [177 Cal.Rptr. 794].)
Conversely, where a responsive pleading is on file, the clerk is not authorized to enter a default. Ã¢ÂÂ[T]he purported entry [in this latter instance is] wholly void and subject to expungement at any time [citations].Ã¢ÂÂ (Original italics.) (Potts v. Whitson (1942) 52 Cal.App.2d 199, 207 [125 P.2d 947]; Wilson v. Goldman, supra, 274 Cal.App.2d 573, 577 [79 Cal.Rptr. 309]; see also Farrar v. Steenbergh (1916) 173 Cal. 94, 96-97 [159 P. 707]; Baird v. Smith (1932) 216 Cal. 408, 410-411 [14 P.2d 749].)
In the present case defendant concedes that the document entitled Ã¢ÂÂDeclaration (CCP ÃÂ§ÃÂ§ 527, 2015.5) by Defendant Opposing Application for Preliminary Injunction (CCP ÃÂ§ 527)Ã¢ÂÂ is not properly an answer to the complaint. In other words, not only is the document not labeled an Ã¢ÂÂanswer,Ã¢ÂÂ it is not a pleading,10 nor is its stated purpose to controvert the *Supp. 8material allegations of the complaint with allegations generally or specifically denying them or to set forth new matter constituting a defense. (Code Civ. Proc., ÃÂ§ÃÂ§ 431.30, 420; cf. Code Civ. Proc., ÃÂ§ÃÂ§ 2003, 2009, 2015.5.)
He urges, however, that the document should be construed to be the equivalent of an answer since Ã¢ÂÂalthough inartfully entitled and documented [sz'c], [it] nevertheless contained language generally denying all of the material allegations of the Complaint.Ã¢ÂÂ He further urges that the document should be considered an Ã¢ÂÂanswerÃ¢ÂÂ to the complaint for the additional reason that under the rules of the pilot project for economic litigation technical forms of pleading are not necessary (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 1715(a)) and an Ã¢ÂÂanswerÃ¢ÂÂ under those rules is simply a pleading that admits or denies the allegations of the complaint (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 1715(c)).
We reject defendantÃ¢ÂÂs contentions. Initially, we point out that this action, which was filed on January 31, 1983, is not subject to the rules governing the pilot economic litigation project. California Rules of Court, rule 1711(a), expressly limits the project to those Ã¢ÂÂcivil action[s] filed and heard between January 1, 1978, and December 31, 1980 . . . .Ã¢ÂÂ
Furthermore, Ã¢ÂÂ[i]t is settled that the entry of default by the clerk is a ministerial duty and that he has no authority whatever to determine the sufficiency, either as to the substance or form, of a pleading on file. (Rose v. Lelande (1912) 20 Cal.App. 502, 503-504 [129 P. 599]; Bristol Convalescent Hosp. v. Stone (1968) 258 Cal.App.2d 848, 862 [66 Cal.Rptr. 404].)Ã¢ÂÂ (Goddard v. Pollock (1974) 37 Cal.App.3d 137, 143 [112 Cal.Rptr. 215]; Potts v. Whitson, supra, 52 Cal.App.2d 199, 207.
Accordingly, the clerk in the present case was not authorized to peruse the document in question to determine whether or not it constituted an answer or should be construed as one. Instead, the clerk was entitled to rely on the documentÃ¢ÂÂs label in making the determination whether an answer had been filed by defendant. (Goddard, supra, at p. 143; cf. Baske, supra, 125 Cal.App.3d at pp. 42, 45.) Nothing in the label here would have alerted a reasonable clerk that the document was intended to be an answer to the complaint.11 Nor did defendant here notify the court prior to the entry of default that he intended the document in question to be a response to the complaint. (Cf. Baske, supra, 125 Cal.App.3d 38, at pp. 42, 45.)
*Supp. 9We turn now to defendantÃ¢ÂÂs alternative ground for asserting that the judgment is void. Specifically, defendant claims that the award of $11,479.95 as compensatory damages was in excess of the courtÃ¢ÂÂs jurisdiction for the reason that Ã¢ÂÂneither the Prayer nor the body of the Complaint demands a specific amount of compensatory damages.Ã¢ÂÂ (See Code Civ. Proc., ÃÂ§ 580.) He asserts that although the prayer requests the specific sum of $15,000 as punitive damages, it is established that a prayer for punitive damages in a certain amount cannot be used to justify such an award of compensatory damages. (Becker v. S.P.V. Construction Co., supra, 27 Cal.3d 489, 494-495.)
As an attendant argument, defendant contends that the award of $1,250 as attorney fees pursuant to Civil Code section 789.3 is also void. He argues that such an award would be proper only if plaintiffs were the Ã¢ÂÂprevailing parties.Ã¢ÂÂ He claims that they are not since there is no Ã¢ÂÂfinal judgment,Ã¢ÂÂ inasmuch as the award of compensatory damages is void. (See Leo v. Dunlap (1968) 260 Cal.App.2d 24, 27-28 [66 Cal.Rptr. 888].)
We have no quarrel with defendantÃ¢ÂÂs recitation of law. We conclude, however, that defendant misapprehends the applicability of the law to the facts of this case.
Ã¢ÂÂ[Code of Civil Procedure section 580] provides in relevant part that 1 [t]he relief granted to the plaintiff, if there be no answer, cannot exceed that which he shall have demanded in his complaint . . . . Ã¢ÂÂ  The primary purpose of this section is to insure that defendants in cases which involve a default judgment have adequate notice of the judgments that may be taken against them. (Anderson v. Mart (1956) 47 Cal.2d 274, 282 [303 P.2d 539].) Ã¢ÂÂIf a judgment other than that which is demanded is taken against him, [the defendant] has been deprived of his day in courtÃ¢ÂÂa right to a hearing on the matter adjudicated. Ã¢ÂÂ (Burtnett v. King, supra, 33 Cal.2d at p. 808; accord Swycaffer v. Swycaffer [(1959)] 44 Cal.2d [689] at p. 693 [285 P.2d 1].)Ã¢ÂÂ (Becker, supra, 27 Cal.3d at p. 493.)
We find no violation of section 580 in the present case.
Unlike the situation in courts of general jurisdiction, such as superior courts, where Ã¢ÂÂsky is the limitÃ¢ÂÂ awards are possible, a municipal court, which is a court of limited jurisdiction, has subject matter jurisdiction in *Supp. 10actions seeking monetary damages only over matters where the amount in controversy is $15,000 or less.12 (Code Civ. Proc., ÃÂ§ 86.) The prayer in the present case reveals that plaintiffs Ã¢ÂÂwaive all amounts in excess of the CourtÃ¢ÂÂs jurisdiction.Ã¢ÂÂ Defendant here was thus on notice that, at most, he would be subject to an award of damages against him in an amount of no more than $15,000.  The actual award in the sum of $11,479.95 fell far below that amount.13
Specifically, we reject defendantÃ¢ÂÂs contention that the request for compensatory damages here is violative of section 580 for lack of a monetary amount certain. We conclude that, when viewed with the jurisdictional limit in mind, the references in the complaint to damages pursuant to Civil Code section 789.3 provide defendant with sufficient notice to satisfy the mandate of section 580. (See Thorson v. Western Development Corp. (1967) 251 Cal.App.2d 206, 212 [59 Cal.Rptr. 299], cited with approval in Becker, supra, 27 Cal.3d at 494.)
Civil Code section 789.3, subdivision (c), provides: Ã¢ÂÂ(c) Any landlord who violates this section shall be liable to the tenant in a civil action for all of the following: (1) Actual damages of the tenant. (2) An amount not to exceed one hundred dollars ($100) for each day or part thereof the landlord remains in violation of this section. In determining the amount of such award, the court shall consider proof of such matters as justice may require; however, in no event shall less than two hundred fifty dollars ($250) be awarded for each separate cause of action. Subsequent or repeated violations, which are not committed contemporaneously with the initial violation, shall be treated as separate causes of action and shall be subject to a separate award of damages.Ã¢ÂÂ
*Supp. 11Based on the foregoing analysis, we further conclude that defendantÃ¢ÂÂs companion argument that the award of attorneyÃ¢ÂÂs fees is void for lack of a valid Ã¢ÂÂfinal judgmentÃ¢ÂÂ is also devoid of merit.
The order is affirmed.
Bernstein, J., and Shabo, J., concurred.

 A void entry of default or judgment may be attacked collaterally at any time by a motion to vacate under Code of Civil Procedure section 473. An order denying a motion made on those grounds is appealable under Code of Civil Procedure section 904.2, subdivision (b). (See County of Ventura v. Tillett (1982) 133 Cal.App.3d 105, 110-111 [183 Cal.Rptr. 741]; Burtnett v. King (1949) 33 Cal.2d 805, 806-807 [205 P.2d 657, 12 A.L.R.2d 333]; Wilson v. Goldman (1969) 274 Cal.App.2d 573, 577 [79 Cal.Rptr. 309].)


 Defendant does not renew the other basis for his motion, i.e., total abandonment of defendant by his former attorney.


 Although defendant did not present this ground in his motion below, the issue of subject matter jurisdiction is never waived and may be raised for the first time on appeal. (Petty v. Manpower, Inc. (1979) 94 Cal.App.3d 794, 798-799 [156 Cal.Rptr. 622].)


 Civil Code section 789.3, in pertinent part, provides: Ã¢ÂÂ(a) A landlord shall not with intent to terminate the occupancy under any lease or other tenancy or estate at will, however created, of property used by a tenant as his residence willfully cause, directly or indirectly, the interruption or termination of any utility service furnished the tenant, including, but not limited to, water, heat, light, electricity, gas, telephone, elevator, or refrigeration, whether or not the utility service is under the control of the landlord, [f] (b) In addition, a landlord shall not, with intent to terminate the occupancy under any lease or other tenancy or estate at will, however created, of property used by a tenant as his or her residence, willfully: [H] (1) Prevent the tenant from gaining reasonable access to the property by changing the locks or using a bootlock or by any other similar method or device; [S] (2) Remove outside doors or windows; . . .Ã¢ÂÂ


Civil Code section 789.3, subdivision (c), which specifies the nature of recoverable damages and a formula for calculating certain damages, is set forth, post, at page Supp. 10.


 Civil Code section 789.3, subdivision (d) provides: Ã¢ÂÂIn any action under subdivision (c) the court shall award reasonable attorneyÃ¢ÂÂs fees to the prevailing party. In any such action the tenant may seek appropriate injunctive relief to prevent continuing or further violation of the provisions of this section during the pendency of the action. The remedy provided by this section is not exclusive and shall not preclude the tenant from pursuing any other remedy which the tenant may have under any other provision of law.Ã¢ÂÂ


We disagree with defendantÃ¢ÂÂs assertion to the contrary, post, at pages Supp. 7-8.


 In the judgment roll there is a document which is simply entitled Ã¢ÂÂRuling.Ã¢ÂÂ Although the document refers to defendantÃ¢ÂÂs motion for default relief, sets forth certain reasons for denial of the motion, and announces that Ã¢ÂÂthe motion is denied,Ã¢ÂÂ the document bears no name or signature of its author nor any date. More importantly, the document exhibits no indicia, such as a filing stamp entry, that it is an official court record. Arguably, the document could reflect the courtÃ¢ÂÂs tentative ruling or a memorandum or statement of decision. However, nothing in the record indicates what this document is or purports to be. Accordingly, we disregard the document as a matter not of record.


 Subdivision (b) of section 585 provides, in pertinent part, that in an action other than on a contract, Ã¢ÂÂif the defendant has been served, other than by publication, and no answer, demurrer, notice of motion to strike . . ., notice of motion to transfer . . ., notice of motion to quash service of summons or to stay or dismiss the action ... or notice of the filing of a petition for writ of mandate . . . has been filed . . ., the clerk, . . . upon written application of the plaintiff, shall enter the default of the defendant.Ã¢ÂÂ


 Specifically, we note that a declaration is not one of the documents expressly enumerated in Code of Civil Procedure section 585, the filing of which would preclude the entry of default by the clerk.


 Parenthetically, from our review of the document, it is clear that its sum and substance is simply to set forth evidence to oppose plaintiffsÃ¢ÂÂ application for injunctive relief, which is also its stated purpose.


 Effective January 1, 1986, the monetary jurisdictional limit of municipal courts will be raised to $25,000. (Assem. Bill No. 82, Ch. 1383.)


 We note that the award of damages here is not characterized as representing compensatory or punitive damages, or some of each. Nonetheless, the failure of the court to apportion the award between actual damages and punitive damages does not render the award void or erroneous. (See Cobian v. Ordonez (1980) 103 Cal.App.3d Supp. 22, 29-30 [163 Cal.Rptr. 126].) Any Ã¢ÂÂuncertainty in the basis of the award by the trial court must be resolved in favor of [upholding the] judgment since defendant prosecuted his appeal to this court on a judgment roll only.Ã¢ÂÂ (Thorson v. Western Development Corp. (1967) 251 Cal.App.2d 206, 214 [59 Cal.Rptr. 299]; cit. omitted; see also Denham v. Superior Court (1970) 2 Cal.3d 557, 564 [86 Cal.Rptr. 65, 468 P.2d 193].) Moreover, a defaulted defendant is not entitled to interpose a denial or affirmative defense to the monetary damages claimed by plaintiff, either as to the nature or the amount of damages sought, unless the award reflects a jurisdictional defect. (See Devlin v. Kearny Mesa AMC/Jeep/Renault, Inc. (1984) 155 Cal.App.3d 381, 385-387 [202 Cal.Rptr. 204].)

*Supp. 16Opinion
COOPERMAN, P. J.
On September 11, 1984, plaintiff Continental Insurance Company (hereafter Continental) filed a complaint1 in interpleader, for declaratory relief, for indemnity, and for reimbursement based on the following pertinent allegations: Plaintiff is a New Hampshire corporation authorized to conduct and conducts a general insurance and surety business in California. Defendants Richard V. Stanton, Donald E. Crockett, Larry Chambers, and Howard Mandel are California residents. Defendant J & T Trucking Company is a California Corporation. Defendant Stanton, dba Motor Truck Transport, was duly licensed as and was doing business as a trucking and hauling business pursuant to the laws of California.
On or about February 5, 1979, defendant Stanton executed and delivered to plaintiff a written application for a surety bond pursuant to which Stanton agreed to reimburse and indemnify plaintiff from any and all damages, expenses, etc., including attorney fees, that arose by reason of its suretyship obligations under the applied-for surety bond. Exhibit Ã¢ÂÂ1Ã¢ÂÂ to the complaint was a copy of the application.
On or about April 4, 1979, plaintiff, as surety, and Stanton, as principal, executed and delivered Sub-HaulerÃ¢ÂÂs Bond No. 2151656 in favor of the People of the State of California in the penal sum of $10,000 and conditioned as required by sections 3575 and 1074 of the California Public Utilities Code. Exhibit Ã¢ÂÂ2Ã¢ÂÂ to the complaint was a copy of the bond. The bond was to be effective as of February 20, 1979, and to remain in effect until it was cancelled.
On or about July 12, 1979, the bond was amended to change the name of the principal under the bond from Richard V. Stanton to Richard V. Stanton, dba Motor Truck Transport. Exhibit Ã¢ÂÂ3Ã¢ÂÂ to the complaint was a copy of the bond amendment, which was effective as of June 28, 1979, until can-celled.
Plaintiff sought to interplead the penal sum of the bond, i.e., $10,000, for the reason that defendants Crockett, Chambers, Mandel, and J & T Trucking Company each had asserted claims against plaintiff on the bond for losses or damages claimed to have been suffered by them on account of StantonÃ¢ÂÂs actions during the period the bond was in effect, which claims aggregated to a sum substantially in excess of the $10,000 limit of the bond. *Supp. 17In conjunction with the interpleader cause of action, plaintiff requested an award of attorney fees.
Plaintiff also sought a declaration concerning the duties plaintiff may owe defendants and defendantsÃ¢ÂÂ respective rights as to the bond. As for Stanton, plaintiff requested recovery of costs, including attorney fees, on the alternative theories of express indemnity and statutory reimbursement pursuant to Civil Code section 2847.
Crockett answered by denying that plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs liability on the bond was limited to the penal sum of $10,000 and that plaintiff was entitled to recover its costs and attorney fees.
CrockettÃ¢ÂÂs cross-complaint, which is dated February 25, 1983, alleged in paragraph 6 that Ã¢ÂÂ[wjithin one year last past [he] performed subhaul services for [Stanton] with a total aggregate value of $10,305.31. [He] demanded that sum from [Stanton] on or about June 1, 1982, but [Stanton] has failed and refused to pay [Crockett] anything but the sum of $600 in cash and property worth $900, leaving due and owing the sum of $8,805.31.Ã¢ÂÂ Crockett sought recovery of $8,805.31 plus interest from Stanton and plaintiff for the performed but unpaid subhaul services and for a declaration that Crockett was entitled to receive the full value of that claim against the bond. It was alleged in pertinent part that plaintiff/cross-defendant Continental was a surety on a bond issued pursuant to California Public Utilities Code sections 1074 and 3575 in the amount of $15,000 for the benefit of subhaulers engaged by Stanton, dba Motor Truck Transport.
Continental answered the cross-complaint by generally denying the material allegations. By way of affirmative defenses, it asserted that the cross-complaint failed to state a cause of action against it and that the bond in question was limited on its face to the penal sum of $10,000, which sum could not be increased or altered since to do so would violate the contracts clause of article I, section 9, of the California Constitution.2
The settled statement reflects the following transpired at trial;
Present at trial were James Trachy, attorney for plaintiff and cross-defendant Continental Insurance Co.; R. Stevens Condie, attorney for inter-pleader defendant and cross-complainant Donald Crockett; Donald Crockett; Gerald Gress, attorney for interpleader defendant Larry Chambers; and interpleader defendant Howard Mandel, dba Mobile Body & Paint, in propria persona. There was no appearance by defendant Richard V. Stanton.
*Supp. 18No testimony was received.
Condie advised the court of the issues and positions of the parties as follows:
Plaintiff and cross-defendant Continental Insurance Company had submitted the sum of $10,000 to be divided by interpleader among the four Ã¢ÂÂsub-haulÃ¢ÂÂ truckdrivers who had not been paid for their work by cross-defendant Stanton and who were the interpleader defendants in the case. The indebtedness of Stanton to the four truck drivers exceeded $50,000.
Crockett brought a cross-complaint alleging that the bond obligation of Continental Insurance Company is not $10,000 but $15,000. No other party joined in the cross-complaint.
In the event Crockett prevailed, he asserted a right to enjoy sole payment from the additional $5,000, which would reduce the value of his claim on the rest of the bond.
Condie then advised the court of the following stipulations:
All parties agreed that defendant J & T Trucking should receive $800 from the bond, in satisfaction of its claim thereon.
Of the remaining truckers, the following amounts were stipulated as the full value of each partyÃ¢ÂÂs claim:
1. Chambers: $47,000.00
2. Crockett: $ 8,000.00
3. Mandel (Mobile Body & Paint): $ 2,535.05
In the event that CrockettÃ¢ÂÂs claim for $5,000 was denied, the proportionate interests of the remaining three truckers would be:
1. Chambers: .806
2. Crockett: .151
3. Mandel: .043
On the other hand, if CrockettÃ¢ÂÂs claim for $5,000 was upheld the proportionate interests of the remaining three truckers would be:
*Supp. 191. Chambers:
.881
2. Crockett:
.071 (in addition to the $5,000)
3. Mandel:
.048
After Trachy and Condie briefly argued their respective legal positions concerning the merits of the cross-complaint, they agreed to submit the matter on their trial briefs and the evidence supplied by ContinentalÃ¢ÂÂs Evidence Code section 1511 notice and Code of Civil Procedure section 98 notice.3 Trachy also argued briefly in support of ContinentalÃ¢ÂÂs request for attorney fees payable from the interpleaded amount of the bond pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 386.6.
All parties present agreed to submit the matter.
The courtÃ¢ÂÂs minutes reflect that the trial took place on May 16, 1984, and that after the matter was submitted, the trial court on the same day rendered judgment for the interpleader defendants on the complaint. It ordered plaintiff to pay $10,000 less $1,000 attorney fees and costs and declared that after such payment plaintiff would be discharged from further liability to defendants and cross-complainant. Specifically, the judgment, as entered, reveals that J & T Trucking Company was awarded the sum of $800, Crockett the sum of $582.20, Chambers the sum of $7,224.20, and Mandel the sum of $393.20. Plaintiff/cross-defendant Continental prevailed against Crockett on the latterÃ¢ÂÂs cross-complaint but was given no award for costs or attorney fees in that regard.
On appeal from the judgment Crockett complains that the court erred in limiting his recovery on the complaint to the sum of $582.20 and in failing to award him any relief on his cross-complaint. Essentially, his position is three-pronged: (1) the amount of the bond is $15,000, not $10,000; (2) it was error to award $1,000 in costs and attorney fees to Continental from the amount of the bond; and (3) the court made an arithmetical error in computing the respective amounts of the judgment in favor of each defendant, except J & T Trucking.
*Supp. 20We find no merit to CrockettÃ¢ÂÂs first and second claims. We agree, however, that the judgment in favor of each defendant, except J & T Trucking, does in fact reflect arithmetical errors. We therefore affirm the judgment as modified to reflect the correct amounts.
I.4 SuretyÃ¢ÂÂs Aggregate Liability on the Bond
Crockett concedes that the face amount of the bond in question is $10,000. Nonetheless, he asserts that the actual amount of the bond is in fact $15,000. The keystone of his position is his assertion that $15,000 was the amount of bond required under Public Utilities Code sections 1074 and 3375 and Public Utilities Commission General Order [G.O.] No. 102-H at the time the claims in question arose.
Pointing to the fact that the bond agreement here expressly states that the amount of the bond Ã¢ÂÂhas been determined by the Commission in its General Order No. 102 series to secure the payment of the claim of subhaulers, [etc.] (emph. added)Ã¢ÂÂ and to the fact that the bond has no expiration date, Crockett contends that the significance of those facts is to render the amount of the bond at issue flexible, i.e., to be determined by the amount of bond required by the G.O. No. 102 in effect at the time the claim or claims arose.
Based on that reasoning Crockett urges us to disregard the face amount of the bond, i.e., $10,000, since that figure was the amount required by the former G.O. No. 102-F,5 which was in effect in 1979 when the bond was originally procured, and to adopt the $15,000 figure, which reflects the bond amount required by G.O. No. 102-H, which was in effect at the time the subject claims arose and is presently in effect.
Alternatively, Crockett contends that the bond in question is uncertain concerning the actual amount involved, i.e., there is a conflict between the face amount of the bond and the condition that the bond is subject to the amount specified in the G.O. 102 series, and, thus, the amount should be interpreted to give effect to the intent of the parties contracting the bond. (Civ. Code, ÃÂ§ÃÂ§ 1641, 1650, 1643, 1649.) He asserts that since Ã¢ÂÂ[t]he intent of the bond is stated unequivocally in its heading: it is to secure payments to subhaulers pursuant to the G.O. 102 seriesthe parties evidenced Ã¢ÂÂa *Supp. 21clear intent to secure obligations which will change over time.Ã¢ÂÂ Accordingly, when the $10,000 limit in former G.O. No. 102-F was increased to $15,000 pursuant to the superseding G.O. No. 102-H, the amount of the bond here must also be construed to have increased to that latter amount in order to effectuate the partiesÃ¢ÂÂ intent.
Crockett cites as authority City of Torrance v. WorkersÃ¢ÂÂ Comp. Appeals Bd. (1982) 32 Cal.3d 371 [185 Cal.Rptr. 645, 650 P.2d 1162], which holds that laws enacted subsequent to the execution of an agreement are deemed to become part of the agreement where the evidence establishes this to have been the partiesÃ¢ÂÂ intent (id., at p. 379), for his conclusion that the amount of the bond must be based on the G.O. No. 102 in effect at the time the claim arose.
As another compelling reason, Crockett argues that the increase in the amount of a bond applies automatically, in any event, since the Public Utilities CommissionÃ¢ÂÂs system for adopting general orders permits a surety ample opportunity to cancel a bond prior to an increase in coverage taking effect, and thus, a suretyÃ¢ÂÂs failure to cancel must be construed as consent to the new liability limitation.
By way of exemplary support, Crockett asserts: Ã¢ÂÂAs can be seen from the terms of G.O. 102-G and G.O. 102-H, a surety company is always given an opportunity to cancel its bond[s] prior to the effective date of a new order. In the case of G.O. 102-H almost three months elapsed between adoption and issuance. Thus, any surety that wishes not to be subject to the obligations of the new G.O. is not placed in a position of doing so involuntarily. Since the bonds are perpetual until cancelled, this is the only practical way to change the terms or amounts of the bonds as the P.U.C. [Public Utilities Commission] is required to do by Public Utilities Code sections 1074 and 3575.Ã¢ÂÂ
As a final argument, Crockett contends that Continental, the surety, is estopped from denying that the bond here is in compliance with the law, i.e., that the amount of the bond is $15,000. In other words, if the bond amount here were considered to be $10,000, then the bond would be Ã¢ÂÂillegalÃ¢ÂÂ since it would not be legally adequate.
Crockett asserts that he reasonably relied on the bond as being sufficient in amount to cover any claims he might have against Stanton up to the legal limit required for the bond while Continental, which has a duty to ensure that its bonds are legal, could have protected itself by asking Stanton for an additional premium amount if it considered it necessary.
*Supp. 22In this regard, he claims that Continental accepted premium payments for the bond through its cancellation date of September 14, 1982, that the work Crockett performed for Stanton took place a year after the new bond limit took effect but before the bond was cancelled, and that he relied on a legal bond being in force at the time the work was performed. From these factors Crockett concludes that Continental, not he, should bear the loss if in fact Stanton should have applied for an increase in bond amount but failed to do so.
In support, Crockett recites the maxims that it is presumed the law has been obeyed (Civ. Code, ÃÂ§ 3548) and that between one of two innocent persons who must suffer by the act of a third, he, by whose negligence it happened, must be the sufferer (Civ. Code, ÃÂ§ 3543).
We reject CrockettÃ¢ÂÂs multi-faceted position for the reasons that it is based on a misinterpretation of the bond agreement between Stanton and Continental and is contrary to law.6
A. The Bond
The bond agreement expressly specifies $10,000 as the face value of the amount of the bond. The agreement further provides: Ã¢ÂÂThe SuretyÃ¢ÂÂs obligation under this bond shall not be discharged by any payment or succession of payments on claims hereunder unless and until such payment or payments shall amount in the aggregate to the penalty of this bond; provided, however, that the aggregate liability of the Surety for all such claims shall, in no event, exceed the sum of $10,000.Ã¢ÂÂ From the foregoing it would appear that the suretyÃ¢ÂÂs aggregate liability on the bond is limited to $10,000, which is the face value of the bond.
However, elsewhere in the agreement the following language appears: Ã¢ÂÂThe condition of this bond is such that:
Ã¢ÂÂWhereas, Sections 3575 and 1074 of the Public Utilities Code require the filing of a bond in such circumstances, the amounts of which has been determined by the Commission in its General Order No. 102 series to secure the payment of the claims of subhaulers, sub-subhaulers and lessor-employees of such highway carrier. . . .
*Supp. 23Ã¢ÂÂThis bond effective from the 20th day of February, 1979, A.M., Pacific Standard Time, at the address of the Principal, as stated herein, shall be continuous and remain in full force and effect until cancelled as hereinafter provided.
Ã¢ÂÂThe Surety may cancel this bond, only by written notice to the Public Utilities Commission of the State of California at its office in San Francisco, California, such cancellation only to become effective thirty (30) days after receipt of said notice by the Commission.Ã¢ÂÂ
We disagree that the language quoted immediately above must be interpreted to render the face value of the bond variable, i.e., subject to the amount of bond required by the G.O. No. 102 in effect at the time the claim arose.
CrockettÃ¢ÂÂs reliance on the City of Torrance, supra, 32 Cal.3d 371 case is patently misplaced. In that case the court concluded that the parties expressly intended to incorporate subsequent statutory changes into the terms of their private contract based on the following evidence: Ã¢ÂÂFirst, the language of the agreements . . . clearly indicates that it was the intention of all the parties to incorporate subsequent changes in the law. . . . Moreover, at oral argument in this case, the City agreed that it was the partiesÃ¢ÂÂ intention to incorporate subsequent changes in the law in their insurance agreements. Ã¢ÂÂ {City of Torrance v. WorkersÃ¢ÂÂ Comp. Appeals Bd.., supra, 32 Cal.3d 371, 379.)
The City of Torrance court expressly distinguished the matter before it from the fact situation facing the court in Swenson v. File (1970) 3 Cal.3d 389 [90 Cal.Rptr. 580, 475 P.2d 852], {Ibid.)
In Swenson the court announced the general rule that Ã¢ÂÂ[Ljaws enacted subsequent to the execution of an agreement are not ordinarily deemed to become part of the agreement unless its language clearly indicates this to have been the intention of the parties. [Citations.]Ã¢ÂÂ {Swenson, supra, at p. 393.) The Swenson court found no evidence of such intent in the matter before it. {Id., at pp. 394-395.)
Similarly, in the present case, there is no evidence that the parties to the bond agreement at issue intended the amount of the bond to be determined by subsequent changes in the law. The record does not reflect that any extrinsic evidence was presented concerning the partiesÃ¢ÂÂ intent. Moreover, the language of the agreement itself does not give rise to an inference that the parties intended that the amount of the bond fluctuate depending on the amount specified by superseding regulations in the G.O. No. 102 series. (Cf. City of Torrance, supra, 32 Cal.3d at pp. 378-379.)
*Supp. 24To the contrary, it is manifestly clear that the bondÃ¢ÂÂs reference to Ã¢ÂÂthe General Order No. 102 seriesÃ¢ÂÂ is merely to identify and point out the source for the $10,000 figure as the amount of the bond.7
Accordingly, since neither the bond itself nor the parties evidenced an intent to incorporate subsequent changes in the law, the amount of the bond at issue, as a contractual matter, must be determined by reference to the provisions of the general order in the G.O. No. 102 series in effect at the time the bond was executed, i.e., No. 102-F, which set the amount of the bond required in the sum of $10,000. {Brown v. Lattimore (1860) 17 Cal. 93, 96; see also, Treweek v. Howard (1895) 105 Cal. 434, 437 [39 P. 20].)
B. The G.O. No. 102 Series
Independent of his contract contentions, Crockett asserts, alternatively, that the nature of the commissionÃ¢ÂÂs system for adopting general orders renders it necessary for the amount of the bond to be increased automatically in order to reflect the increase in the amount of the bond required pursuant to subsequent general orders.
The thrust of his argument is that since a surety has ample time to cancel the bond prior to the effective date of a new general order, due to a time gap between the date of its adoption and the date it goes into effect, the suretyÃ¢ÂÂs failure to cancel a bond prior to the effective date of the increase must be construed to signify the suretyÃ¢ÂÂs consent to the new liability limitation. He reasons that Ã¢ÂÂthis is the only practical way to change the terms or amounts of the bonds as the [commission] is required to do by Public Utilities Code ÃÂ§ÃÂ§ 1074 and 3575.Ã¢ÂÂ
We disagree.
CrockettÃ¢ÂÂs position in this regard is based on a misapprehension of the statutory scheme for regulating bonds governed by the Public Utilities Code and the companion provisions in the Code of Civil Procedure, the nature of the regulations promulgated by the commission, and the scope of the commissionÃ¢ÂÂs power.
1. The Statutory Scheme
From our review of the legislative history of the pertinent statutory provisions, we conclude that it has always been and continues to be the Leg*Supp. 25islatureÃ¢ÂÂs intent to limit a suretyÃ¢ÂÂs aggregate liability on the bond to the face amount of the bond. (Code Civ. Proc., ÃÂ§ 996.470, subd. (a); cf. Code Civ. Proc., ÃÂ§ 996.475.)
In 1979, the year the subject bond was issued, Public Utilities Code sections 1074 and 3575, respectively, read: Ã¢ÂÂEvery highway common carrier, cement carrier and every petroleum irregular route carrier who engages subhaulers or leases equipment from employees shall file with the commission a bond, the amount of which shall be determined by the commission but which shall be not less than two thousand dollars ($2,000), executed by a qualified surety insurer, subject to the approval of the commission, which bond shall secure the payment of the claims of subhaulers and employee-lessors of the highway common carrier, cement carrier or petroleum irregular route carrier. The aggregate liability of the surety for all such claims shall, in no event, exceed the sum of such bond.Ã¢ÂÂ (Italics added.)
Ã¢ÂÂEvery highway contract carrier, dump truck carrier, livestock carrier, cement contract carrier and every radial highway common carrier who engages subhaulers or leases equipment from employees shall file with the commission a bond, the amount of which shall be determined by the commission but which shall be not less than two thousand dollars ($2,000), executed by a qualified surety insurer, subject to the approval of the commission, which bond shall secure the payment of the claims of subhaulers and employee-lessors of the highway carrier, provided, however, that the aggregate liability of the surety for all such claims shall, in no event, exceed the sum of such bond.Ã¢ÂÂ (Italics added.)
In 1982, those sections were amended by deleting the italicized language of sections 1074 and 3575 quoted above.8 (Stats. 1982, ch. 517, ÃÂ§ÃÂ§ 353, 354, p. 2413.)
*Supp. 26The subsequent deletion of the language Ã¢ÂÂthe aggregate liability of the surety for all such claims shall, in no event, exceed the sum of such bondÃ¢ÂÂ from former sections 1074 and 3575 by the Legislature in 1982 presents an issue as to the LegislatureÃ¢ÂÂs intent. By this deletion, did the Legislature intend a substantive change in the aggregate liability of the surety, i.e., to eliminate the face amount of the bond as the limitation on the suretyÃ¢ÂÂs liability, or did the Legislature simply intend to clarify the law?
Ã¢ÂÂThe cardinal rule of statutory construction is that the intention of the Legislature must be ascertained and given effect. [Citations.]Ã¢ÂÂ (Van Nuis v. Los Angeles Soap Co. (1973) 36 Cal.App.3d 222, 228 [111 Cal.Rptr. 398]; T.M. Cobb Co. v. Superior Court (1984) 36 Cal.3d 273, 277 [204 Cal.Rptr. 143, 682 P.2d 338]; Select Base Materials v. Board of Equal. (1959) 51 Cal.2d 640, 645 [335 P.2d 672].) Ã¢ÂÂMoreover, Ã¢ÂÂevery statute should be construed with reference to the whole system of law of which it is a part so that all may be harmonized and have effect.Ã¢ÂÂ (Stafford v. Los Angeles etc. Retirement Board [(1954)] 42 Cal.2d 795, 799 [270 P.2d 12].)Ã¢ÂÂ (Select Base Materials, supra, at p. 645.)
Ã¢ÂÂWhen, as here, there is no direct evidence of the legislative intent, the court turns first to the words of the enactment for the answer and may also rely upon extrinsic aids. [Citations.]Ã¢ÂÂ (Neeley v. Board of Retirement (1974) 36 Cal.App.3d 815, 819 [111 Cal.Rptr. 841].)  Additionally, any ambiguity with regard to legislative intent may be clarified by comparing the language used with that employed in other laws on the same subject. (Bagg v. Wickizer (1935) 9 Cal.AppÃ¢ÂÂ2d 753, 757 [50 P.2d 1047].)
Nothing in the language of sections 1074 and 3575, as amended in 1982, sheds any light on the issue. We must therefore look elsewhere for enlight-
Ã¢ÂÂAs a general rule, an intention to change the law or the meaning of a statute will be inferred or presumed from a material change in the statutory language, such as where the legislature undertakes to amend ex*Supp. 27isting law by deleting an express provision of the previous statute . . . .Ã¢ÂÂ (58 Cal.Jur.3d, Statutes ÃÂ§ 50, pp. 384-385 (fns. omitted); see, e.g., Clements v. T.R. Bechtel Co. (1954) 43 Cal.2d 227, 231 [273 P.2d 5]; Wallace v. Department of Motor Vehicles (1970) 12 Cal.App.3d 356, 361 [90 Cal.Rptr. 657]; Jordan v. Consolidated Mut. Ins. Co. (1976) 59 Cal.App.3d 26, 48 [130 Cal.Rptr. 446]; cf. Koenig v. Johnson (1945) 71 Cal.App.2d 739, 753 [163 P.2d 746] [change may simply indicate a legislative intent to clarify the meaning of the statute]; accord, Nationwide Investment Corp. v. California Funeral Service, Inc. (1974) 40 Cal.App.3d 494, 501 [114 Cal.Rptr. 77].)
In determining whether to apply the above general rule or an exception here we examine the Ã¢ÂÂsurrounding circumstances ... in order to determine the intent with which the change was made.Ã¢ÂÂ (Koenig, supra, 71 Cal.App.2d 739, at p. 753.)
It is established that Ã¢ÂÂ[r]eports of commissions which have proposed statutes that are subsequently adopted are entitled to substantial weight in construing the statutes. [Citations.] This is particularly true where the statute proposed by the commission is adopted by the Legislature without any change whatsoever and where the commissionÃ¢ÂÂs comment is brief, because in such a situation there is ordinarily strong reason to believe that the legislatorsÃ¢ÂÂ votes were based in large measure upon the explanation of the commission proposing the bill.Ã¢ÂÂ (Van Arsdale v. Hollinger. (1968) 68 Cal.2d 245, 249-250 [66 Cal.Rptr. 20, 437 P.2d 508]; accord, Keeler v. Superior Court (1970) 2 Cal.3d 619, 630 [87 Cal.Rptr. 481, 470 P.2d 617, 40 A.L.R.3d 420]; see also, Arellano v. Moreno (1973) 33 Cal.App.3d 877, 884 [109 Cal.Rptr. 421].) Moreover, Ã¢ÂÂ[s]uch [Law Revision Commission] comments are well accepted sources from which to ascertain legislative intent.Ã¢ÂÂ (Davis v. Cordova Recreation & Park Dist. (1972) 24 Cal.App.3d 789, 796 [101 Cal.Rptr. 358].)
In late 1981 the California Law Revision Commission issued d recommendation to the Legislature that the procedural provisions governing statutory bonds and undertakings be compiled in one place in the Code of Civil Procedure and that duplicative provisions from other codes be repealed. (16 Cal. Law Revision Com. Rep. (1982) p. 501, 503, 507-508.)
After noting that the various codes contained more than 500 different bonds and undertakings, the commission urged that this Ã¢ÂÂproliferation of procedural statutes to govern bonds and undertakings is unnecessary. The rules applicable to such matters as the . . . giving of a new or additional bond or undertaking if the original bond or undertaking becomes insuffi*Supp. 28cient, [and] the limitation on liability of a surety to the amount of the bond or undertaking . . . are the same for all bonds and undertakings. Repetition of such procedural rules in every statute that provides for a bond or undertaking is not only wasteful and adds to the complexity and length of the statutes, but also creates the likelihood of inconsistent wording and interpretation where the rules should be the same.Ã¢ÂÂ {Id., at p. 507.)
Specifically, the commission recommended, respectively, the following amendments, to Public Utilities Code sections 1074 and 3575:
Ã¢ÂÂPublic Utilities Code ÃÂ§ 1074 (amended) Comment. Section 1074 is amended to delete a provision duplicated in the Bond and Undertaking Law. See Code Civ. Proc. ÃÂ§ 996.470 (limitation on liability of surety). . . .
Ã¢ÂÂPublic Utilities Code ÃÂ§ 3575 (amended) Comment. Section 3575 is amended to delete a provision duplicated in the Bond and Undertaking Law. See Code Civ. Proc., ÃÂ§ 996.470 (limitation on liability of surety). . . .Ã¢ÂÂ {Id., at pp. 611, 612.)
In response to the commissionÃ¢ÂÂs recommendations the Legislature enacted the Bond and Undertaking Law.9 (Stats. 1982, ch. 998), including Code of Civil Procedure section 996.470, subdivision (a), which reads: Ã¢ÂÂNotwithstanding any other statute, the aggregate liability of a surety to all persons for all breÃÂ¡ches of the condition of a bond is limited to the amount of the bond. Except as otherwise provided by statute, the liability of the principal is not limited to the amount of the bond.Ã¢ÂÂ (Stats. 1982, ch. 998, p. 3677.)
The Legislature also implemented the commissionÃ¢ÂÂs recommendation that the previously quoted and italicized language of sections 1074 and 3575 be deleted as duplicative of newly enacted Code of Civil Procedure section 996.470, subdivision (a).10
*Supp. 29We conclude that the plain language of sections 1074 and 3575 of the Public Utilities Code prior to the 1982 amendments clearly reflected the LegislatureÃ¢ÂÂs intent to limit the suretyÃ¢ÂÂs liability on a bond to the face amount of the bond. (See, e.g., Wallace v. Department of Motor Vehicles, supra, 12 Cal.App.3d 356, 360.)
We further conclude, based on our review of the circumstances surrounding the 1982 amendments and enactment of the Bonding and Undertaking Law, that the Legislature did not intend any substantive changes by the deletion of the language Ã¢ÂÂthe aggregate liability of the surety for all such claims shall, in no event, exceed the sum of such bondÃ¢ÂÂ from sections 1074 and 3575. Instead, the unequivocal purpose underlying such deletion was simply housekeeping, i.e., to clarify and streamline the law and to abolish redundancies.
2. The Nature of the G.O. No. 102 Series
In its amicus curiae brief the Public Utilities Commission espouses the position that a suretyÃ¢ÂÂs aggregate liability on a bond required pursuant to the Public Utilities Code is limited to the face amount of the bond. The commission perceives this to be the LegislatureÃ¢ÂÂs intent underlying Public Utilities Code sections 1074 and 3575, both before and after the 1982 amendments.
In promulgating its regulations pursuant to those sections the commissionÃ¢ÂÂs function is to implement and carry out the LegislatureÃ¢ÂÂs intent. (See, e.g., Mooney v. Pickett (1971) 4 Cal.3d 669, 679 [94 Cal.Rptr. 279, 483 P.2d 1231].) In order to be valid, such regulations must be within the authority conferred on the commission. (Cal. Drive-in Restaurant Assn. v. Clark (1943) 22 Cal.2d 287, 302-303 [140 P.2d 657, 147 A.L.R. 1028].) As a creature of statute, the commission is without jurisdiction to Ã¢ÂÂabridge or enlarge its authority or exceed the powers given to it by the statute, the source of its power. [Citations.]Ã¢ÂÂ (Ibid..)
It is well settled that Ã¢ÂÂcourts respect the interpretation given a statute by the agency charged with its administration and when the construction of an administrative regulation is in issue, the administrative construction is accorded even greater deference. (Citations.)Ã¢ÂÂ (Westfall v. Swoap (1976) 58 Cal.App.3d 109, 114 [129 Cal.Rptr. 750]; see also, Nipper v. California Auto. Assigned Risk Plan (1977) 19 Cal.3d 35, 45 [136 Cal.Rptr. 854, 560 P.2d 743]; Nelson v. Dean (1946) 27 Cal.2d 873, 880-881 [168 P.2d 16, 168 A.L.R. 467].)
Mindful of the foregoing principles, we now address the scope of the commissionÃ¢ÂÂs powers under Public Utilities Code sections 1074 and *Supp. 303575, the commissionÃ¢ÂÂs relationship with prime carriers and sureties in that context, and the nature and purpose of the G.O. No. 102 series.
The commission takes the position that it regulates prime carriers, that it has no authority over sureties, and that an increase in the bond amount required under a general order in the G.O. No. 102 series is the sole responsibility of the prime carriers.
According to the commission in its brief, Ã¢ÂÂan understanding of the CommissionÃ¢ÂÂs regulatory jurisdiction under the Public Utilities Code shows why the Commission would not logically require sureties rather than prime carriers, the principals, to demonstrate compliance with a new bonding requirement.
Ã¢ÂÂThe Public Utilities Code charges the Commission with regulating the business of for-hire transportation over the highways of this state. The providers of such transportation are either common carriers (see [Pub. Util. Code] ÃÂ§ÃÂ§ 1061-1074) or various types of more specialized carriers collectively labelled Ã¢ÂÂrelated businessesÃ¢ÂÂ in Division 2 of the code. The Commission may for good cause suspend or revoke the operating authority of either type of carrier. (See, e.g., [Pub. Util. Code ÃÂ§ÃÂ§] 1070, 3771-3775.) The Commission has no such power as to sureties.
Ã¢ÂÂThere is little reason for the Commission to inject itself in the relationship between principal and surety in order to impose requirements directly on the surety. [Instead,] ... the regulation of suretiesÃ¢ÂÂ conduct [should be left] to that governmental office (i.e., the Insurance Commissioner) to which that task is statutorily delegated. ...Ã¢ÂÂ (The Public Utilities CommissionÃ¢ÂÂs Amicus Curiae Brief [A.C.B.], filed July 30, 1985, at pp. 8-9 [fns. omitted].)
The commission points out that the pre-1982 section 3575 contained an initial proviso clause empowering the commission to determine the minimum amount of security to be required of the prime carrier and that this clause was distinct from and independent of the second proviso clause, which expressly limited the aggregate liability of the surety to the amount of the bond. The commission concludes that the LegislatureÃ¢ÂÂs intent in this regard was to make it clear that the commission had no authority to regulate a suretyÃ¢ÂÂs liability on the bond; instead, its authority concerning the amount of the bond only extended to the prime carrier.
As reinforcement for these conclusions, the commission refers to the 1982 amendments to sections 1074 and 3575 and to the Bonding and Undertaking *Supp. 31Law. Specifically, the commission relies on Code of Civil Procedure section 996.470, subdivision (a), which contains the proviso clause limiting a suretyÃ¢ÂÂs liability to the amount of the bond deleted from the pre-1982 sections 1074 and 3575 as well as a new sentence reflecting that the liability of the principal (prime carrier) is not limited to the amount of the bond.
The commission asserts that the enactment of section 996.470, subdivision (a), is significant for two reasons: Ã¢ÂÂFirst, the Legislature could easily have indicated . . . that the suretyÃ¢ÂÂs liability on a bond is increased over the bondÃ¢ÂÂs face amount if the level of the bonding requirement is raised and the surety fails to cancel the existing bond before the effective date of such increased bonding requirement. Second, . . . [t]he Commission believes that this new sentence confirms the CommissionÃ¢ÂÂs view that the principal, and not the surety, bears the liability arising from the principalÃ¢ÂÂs failure to comply with an increased bonding requirement.
Ã¢ÂÂThe Bonding and Undertaking Law also contains a provision that, although it has no analogue in the Public Utilities Code, essentially codifies the CommissionÃ¢ÂÂs practice in administering the General Order 102 series. The provision [states]: Ã¢ÂÂThe principal shall give a new, additional, or supplemental bond if the court or officer orders that a new, additional, or supplemental bond be given.Ã¢ÂÂ (Code Civ. Proc., ÃÂ§ 996.210 [subdivision] (a).)[11] Under the clear terms of the law, the principalÃ¢ÂÂnot the suretyÃ¢ÂÂhas the burden of maintaining a bond that expressly meets all current requirements. This was and is the CommissionÃ¢ÂÂs intention in the General Order 102 series. This was also the understanding of Commission staff, as manifest from the notice of adoption of General Order 102-H sent by staff to the affected highway carriers.[12]
Ã¢ÂÂIn short, the Bond and Undertaking law confirms this CommissionÃ¢ÂÂs contemporaneous understanding in adopting General Order 102-H that a *Supp. 32suretyÃ¢ÂÂs liability on a subhaul bond is limited to the face amount of the bond.Ã¢ÂÂ (A.C.B., supra, at pp. 6-8.)
Specifically, the Commission rejected CrockettÃ¢ÂÂs assertion that to limit the amount of the bond to its face value Ã¢ÂÂcreates an illegalityÃ¢ÂÂ and conflicts with the bondÃ¢ÂÂs purpose Ã¢ÂÂto secure payments of sums pursuant to the G.O. 102 series. ...Ã¢ÂÂ {Id., at p. 10.)
Ã¢ÂÂIn the CommissionÃ¢ÂÂs view, if a prime carrier fails to file a new, additional, or supplemental bond to satisfy an increased bonding requirement, then the prime carrier is violating that requirement. It does not follow that the existing bond is illegal or in conflict with the new general order, or that the surety on the existing bond is violating the order. For all the surety knows, the prime carrier may have met the increased bonding requirement through an additional bond issued by another surety. The Commission is not aware of, nor does [Crockett] cite, any general rule of law requiring a surety to assume all of a principalÃ¢ÂÂs liability under a statutory bond, or requiring the principal to secure through a single surety all possible claims. (Cf. section 7.b. of General Order 102-H, providing that a bond mayÃ¢ÂÂbut does not have toÃ¢ÂÂcover more than one operative authority held by the same carrier.) In short, the bond in this case was valid and continued to secure claims up to its face amount, even though that amount was less than the bonding requirement of General Order 102-H.Ã¢ÂÂ (A.C.B., supra, at pp. 10-11.)
The commission further asserts that, as a matter of policy, its interpretation of the G.O. No. 102 series affords subhaulers, such as Crockett, better protection* in the long run, against prime carriers, such as Stanton.
Ã¢ÂÂAs noted earlier, the Commission by virtue of its statutory role has considerably more leverage against prime carriers than against sureties. From an enforcement standpoint, it makes little sense to place the burden of reacting in the first instance to regulatory changes upon some entity other than the regulatee.
Ã¢ÂÂFurthermore, under the CommissionÃ¢ÂÂs interpretation, a bond means what it says. Consequently, where a bond has become inadequate because of changes in the General Order 102 series, that inadequacy would be readily apparent to Commission staff reviewing the file. Staff then requires the prime carrier to get a new bond, or at least a rider to the existing bond. Under [CrockettÃ¢ÂÂs] interpretation, staff would have to assume that every bond not cancelled, regardless of its terms, was consistent with the current version of General Order 102. Theoretically, this might shift some risk from subhaulers to sureties, but sureties could achieve the opposite result by *Supp. 33cancelling all subhaul bonds automatically every time the Commission increases the bonding requirement. A gap in liability protection would result for the period following such cancellation, until a new premium had been negotiated and the bond reissued or a new bond given. Avoiding this sort of gap is important for both prime carriers and subhaulers.
Ã¢ÂÂIn summation, the CommissionÃ¢ÂÂs practice, consistent with its views of the General Order 102 series and the underlying statutory provisions, is to require the giving of a new bond, or express modification of an existing bond, where necessitated by adoption of a new version of General Order 102.Ã¢ÂÂ (A.C.B., supra, at pp. 12-13.)
We adopt the commissionÃ¢ÂÂs interpretation of the purpose, implementation, and effect of the G.O. No. 102 series as well-reasoned and as a correct reflection of the law.
C. Estoppel
Finally, we reject CrockettÃ¢ÂÂs estoppel argument on the ground that it is based on the erroneous premises that the bond at issue is Ã¢ÂÂillegalÃ¢ÂÂ and that Continental, as surety, was negligent in failing to procure additional coverage on the bond to the tune of $5,000. In point of fact, it was Stanton, as the prime carrier and principal, who was negligent in this regard since the duty to ensure that the bond was legally sufficient rested with it, not with the surety.
II-III*
The judgment is modified to reflect the award in favor of defendants Crockett, Chambers, and Mandel, respectively, to be the amounts of $1,238.29, $6,609, and $352.60 and is affirmed as modified.
Reese, J., and Shabo, J., concurred.

Our analysis, post, at pages Supp. 24-Supp. 33 concerning the proper amount of the bond as a matter of statutory interpretation obviates the need to address this point.


In his trial brief Crockett asserted that his claim arose after the required $15,000 bond amount became effective. In its trial brief Continental conceded this to be an established fact since it took the position that there were no triable issues of fact, merely a legal issue, i.e., was the bond amount $10,000 or $15,000.
Pursuant to the notices, the court had before it the bond itself, including the amendment, the notice of cancellation, effective September 14, 1982, and G.O. Nos. 102-F, effective July 1, 1974, 102-G, effective November 7, 1980, and 102-H, effective August 7, 1981.


No discussion is required here with regard to parts II and III, which address CrockettÃ¢ÂÂs remaining contentions that do not merit publication. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 976.1.)


Although G.O. No. 102-G became effective on November 7, 1980, which was a date after the bond here was procured, no changes in the required bond amount was effectuated until No. 102-H became effective on August 31, 1981, at which time the bond amount was increased to $15,000.


Continental did not contest CrockettÃ¢ÂÂs assertion that his claims arose after the new bond limit became effective. Instead, its position, both at trial and on appeal, is that CrockettÃ¢ÂÂs legal arguments are erroneous as a matter of law.


In its amicus curiae brief, the Public Utilities Commission Ã¢ÂÂinterprets the bondÃ¢ÂÂs reference to the General Order 102 series as intended to avoid the necessity of reissuing every bond each time changes to the general order become effective, even where the changes do not affect the bond.Ã¢ÂÂ We agree that this is a possible alternative construction of that language.


In 1980, sections 1074 and 3575, respectively, were amended and read: Ã¢ÂÂEvery common carrier subject to Section 1061 who engages subhaulers or leases equipment from employees shall file with the commission a bond, the amount of which shall be determined by the commission but which shall be not less than two thousand dollars ($2,000), executed by a qualified surety insurer, subject to the approval of the commission, which bond shall secure the payment of the claims of subhaulers and employee-lessors of the common carrier. The aggregate liability of the surety for all such claims shall, in no event, exceed the sum of such bond.Ã¢ÂÂ
Ã¢ÂÂEvery highway carrier who engages subhaulers or leases equipment from employees shall file with the commission a bond, the amount of which shall be determined by the commission but which shall be not less than two thousand dollars ($2,000), executed by a qualified surety insurer, subject to the approval of the commission, which bond shall secure the payment of the claims of subhaulers and employee-lessors of the highway carrier; provided, however, that the aggregate liability of the surety for all such claims shall, in no event, exceed the sum of such bond.Ã¢ÂÂ (Stats. 1980, ch. 1096, ÃÂ§ÃÂ§ 11, 22, pp. 3516, 3517.)
However, it was not until 1982 that the subject language was deleted. As amended in *Supp. 261982 and presently, those sections, respectively, read: Ã¢ÂÂEvery common carrier subject to Section 1061 who engages subhaulers or leases equipment from employees shall file with the commission a bond, the amount of which shall be determined by the commission but which shall be not less than two thousand dollars ($2,000), executed by an admitted surety insurer, subject to the approval of the commission, which bond shall secure the payment of the claims of subhaulers and employee-lessors of the common carrier.Ã¢ÂÂ
Ã¢ÂÂEvery highway carrier who engages subhaulers or leases equipment from employees shall file with the commission a bond, the amount of which shall be determined by the commission but which shall be not less than two thousand dollars ($2,000), executed by an admitted surety insurer, subject to the approval of the commission, which bond shall secure the payment of the claims of subhaulers and employee-lessors of the highway carrier.Ã¢ÂÂ (Stats. 1982, ch. 517, ÃÂ§ÃÂ§ 353, 354, p. 2413.)


The law is codified at chapter 2 of title 14 of part 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure, commencing with section 995.010.


Additionally, in 1984 the Legislature added section 996.475 to the Code of Civil Procedure. (Stats. 1984, ch. 538, ÃÂ§ 33.3.) That section provides: Ã¢ÂÂNothing in this chapter is intended to limit the liability of a surety pursuant to any other statute. This section is declaratory of, and not a change in, existing law.Ã¢ÂÂ
The Law Revision Commission Comment (Assembly) regarding section 996.475 clarifies the purpose of that section in conjunction with section 996.470. In pertinent part that Comment reads:
Ã¢ÂÂSection 996.475 is added to make clear that the provisions of this chapter relating to the liability of ÃÂ¡ surety are not intended, either expressly or by implication, to repeal any other applicable statutes relating to the liability of a surety. Thus, for example, the provision in Section 996.470, that the aggregate liability of a surety for all breaches of the condition of a bond is limited to the amount of the bond, is intended only to limit the liability of a surety [on the bond] as security for the obligation imposed by the statute pursuant to which the bond is given. It is not intended to immunize the surety from independent statutory liability for willful failure to satisfy the obligation of a bond after the duty to pay has been established. See, e.g., section 996.480 (voluntary payment by surety). . . .Ã¢ÂÂ (Cal. Law Revision Com. Ann. Rep. (Mar. 1985) com. pp. 102-103; 84 Assem. J. 17814.)


11The term Ã¢ÂÂofficerÃ¢ÂÂ in that section includes the Commission. (Code Civ. Proc., ÃÂ§ 995.160.)


12Ã¢ÂÂOn June 12, 1981, the following notice, signed by the director of the CommissionÃ¢ÂÂs Transportation Division, was mailed to 2,242 prime carriers:
Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂTo: Highway Carriers Who Have Filed Surety Bonds Pursuant To General Order No. 102-Series
Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂBy Decision No. 93146 dated June 2, 1981, the Commission replaced General Order No. 102-G with General Order 102-H. A copy of the Commissions [j/c] decision on this matter will be sent to you soon. [H] Among other things, the Commission increased the minimum level of surety bond which is required as a condition of engaging subhaulers or leasing highway equipment from employees from $10,000 to $15,000. [1] The increased bond amount is scheduled to be effective on August 31, 1981. If you have not received specific authority from the Commission to file a bond for a lesser amount, you must increase the amount of the bond you have on file to not less than $15,000. [H] The employment of subhaulers or lease of highway equipment without a bond on file with the Commission in the required amount is unlawful and will subject you to penalties as provided in the Public Utilities Code.Ã¢ÂÂ (Emphasis added.)Ã¢ÂÂ

CHAPMAN, J.
Procedural Facts
In this appeal we are asked to determine the validity of a grant of probation conditioned upon an order of restitution for damages caused by an automobile accident.
On March 21, 1984, the Campbell City Police responded to an accident at the intersection of Nobli and Fowler. They determined that one of the drivers involved in the accident was the defendant, Randall John Taylor, whose license and driving privilege had been suspended or revoked. They also determined that the accident was caused, at least in part, by the defendant improperly failing to yield while making a left turn. They cited the defendant for a violation of Vehicle Code section 14601.1, subdivision (a), driving on a suspended license, a misdemeanor, and for a violation of Vehicle Code section 21801, subdivision (a), failure to yield while making a left turn, an infraction.
*1254Following arraignment the defendant pleaded guilty to the charge of driving on a suspended license, and nolo contendrÃÂ© to the charge of making an illegal left turn. The trial judge placed defendant on probation on the charge of driving on a suspended license, upon the condition that he pay a fine in the total amount of $255. He suspended judgment on the charge of illegal turn. The matter was thereupon referred to the victim assistance program and continued for further hearing regarding restitution.
At the hearing on restitution the trial judge determined that the other party to the accident had suffered damages to her automobile in the amount of $2,960, but because she had also been at fault in the accident the court limited restitution to one-half of the loss, and ordered the defendant to reimburse the other party in the amount of $1,480.12.
Contentions on Appeal
Defendant contends on appeal that restitution is not an appropriate condition of probation upon a conviction of driving on a suspended license, and that the order denies him due process of law.
We agree.
Discussion
It will be important throughout this discussion to bear in mind that the probationary order is based on the conviction of the crime defined by Vehicle Code section 14601.1, subdivision (a); to-wit, driving on a suspended license, and not on the conviction of the infraction of making an illegal turn.
Restitution or reparation as a condition of probation is expressly authorized by statute and is sanctioned by case authority. (People v. Williams (1966) 247 Cal.App.2d 394, 399 [55 Cal.Rptr. 550]) Penal Code section 1203.1 provides: Ã¢ÂÂThe court or judge thereof, in the order granting probation . . . shall provide for restitution in proper cases; ...Ã¢ÂÂ Penal Code section 1203.04, subdivisions (a) and (d) provide: Ã¢ÂÂ(a) In every case where a person is convicted of a crime and is granted probation the court shall require, as a condition of probation, that the person make restitution as follows: [1] (1) To the victim, if the crime involved a victim. ... [1] (d) . . . Ã¢ÂÂrestitutionÃ¢ÂÂ means full or partial payment for the value of. . . damaged property . . . which losses were caused by the defendant as a result of committing the crime for which he or she was convicted. ...Ã¢ÂÂ (Italics added.)
*1255Defendant contends that the crime of driving on a suspended license is a victimless crime, and that the probation laws are designed to effect the rehabilitation of the criminal, and not to resolve civil liability of the parties. He further points out that important civil due process rights are involved in the determination of civil liability, including the right to a jury trial, and the right to raise the defense of comparative negligence.
In response the district attorney asserts a Ã¢ÂÂbut forÃ¢ÂÂ argument, i.e., if the defendant had not been driving while his license was suspended the accident would not have occurred and there would have been no damage, and that for this reason the trial court did not abuse discretion in ordering restitution as a condition of probation, and furthermore, that defendantÃ¢ÂÂs due process rights were protected in that the trial court conducted a hearing to determine fault and the amount of damages.
A Ã¢ÂÂbut forÃ¢ÂÂ rule is not the test of the validity of a condition of restitution. The district attorney cites People v. Axtell (1981) 118 Cal.App.3d 246, 256 [173 Cal.Rptr. 360], for the proposition that probation is an act of leniency, not a matter of right. Historically this was the rule. Defendant could reject probation and stand before the court for judgment, but if he accepted probation he did so on whatever conditions the court saw fit to impose. Inasmuch as he had accepted probation, he accepted the conditions of probation and therefore had no grounds to object. The idea that a grant of probation was an absolute act of grace was laid to rest in People v. Dominguez (1967) 256 Cal.App.2d 623 [64 Cal.Rptr. 290].
Dominguez is a landmark case, and has been cited many times by the California Supreme Court. See People v. Lent (1975) 15 Cal.3d 481, 486 [124 Cal.Rptr. 905, 541 P.2d 545]; and People v. Richards (1976) 17 Cal.3d 614, 621 [131 Cal.Rptr. 537, 552 P.2d 97].  In People v. Lent, supra, at page 486, the Supreme Court cites the Dominguez rule as follows: Ã¢ÂÂA condition of probation will not be held invalid unless it Ã¢ÂÂ(1) has no relationship to the crime of which the offender was convicted, (2) relates to conduct which is not in itself criminal, and (3) requires or forbids conduct which is not reasonably related to future criminality . . . .Ã¢ÂÂ [Citation.] Conversely, a condition of probation which requires or forbids conduct which is not itself criminal is valid if that conduct is reasonably related to the crime of which the defendant was convicted or to future criminality.Ã¢ÂÂ
The Dominguez standard is often very difficult to apply. For example, in the present case one could argue that the condition is directly related to the crime of which defendant was convicted, i.e., driving on a suspended license, because he was in fact driving when the accident occurred, especially since defendant conceded by his plea of no contest that *1256he made an illegal turn. On the other hand, one can argue with equal vigor that it does not relate to such a crime because the lack of license is an existing condition and not a cause of the accident.  In California, as in most jurisdictions, it has long been the rule in both civil and criminal cases that evidence that a driver is unlicensed is not admissible on the issue of negligence as the cause of an accident. Lehmuth v. Long Beach Unified Sch. Dist. (1960) 53 Cal.2d 544, 554 [2 Cal.Rptr. 279, 348 P.2d 887]; Strandt v. Cannon (1938) 29 Cal.App.2d 509, 518 [85 P.2d 160]; People v. Spragney (1972) 24 Cal.App.3d 333 [100 Cal.Rptr. 902]. In Spragney the court said on pages 338-339: Ã¢ÂÂ. . . Ã¢ÂÂthe operatorÃ¢ÂÂs negligence is to be determined by the facts existing at the time of the accident, and whether the operator had a license to operate an automobile under the laws of this state is immaterial unless there is some causal relationship between the injuries and the failure to have a license or the violation of the statute in failing to have one . . .Ã¢ÂÂ (Strandt v. Cannon, supra, at p. 518) [1] . . . [T]here is no reason why the general rule of inadmissibility should not apply in a criminal proceeding in which negligence is an essential part of the PeopleÃ¢ÂÂs case. Indeed the opinion of the Supreme Court in People v. Costa [1953] 40 Cal.2d 160, 167 [252 P.2d 1], appears to so assume.Ã¢ÂÂ
The vagueness of the Dominguez rule is discussed in a note entitled Jacobson, Use of Restitution in the Criminal Process: People v. Miller (1968-1969) 16 UCLA L.Rev. 456. The note suggests a better test would be to focus on the language of the statute, i.e., Penal Code section 1203.1, which provides in part: Ã¢ÂÂThe court may . . . require . . . conditions . . . as it may determine are fitting and proper to the end that justice may be done, that amends may be made to society for the breach of the law, for any injury done to any person resulting from such breach and generally and specifically for the reformation and rehabilitation of the probationer.Ã¢ÂÂ (Italics added.)
The note concludes, on page 474: Ã¢ÂÂThis note has attempted to formulate guidelines which would not frustrate the use of corrective restitution in instances where that use would be rehabilitative, but also would not allow a court total discretion as to what was and what was not rehabilitative. The conclusion is that restitution, as a condition of probation, is proper if it requires the payment of fixed liabilities: (1) incurred as the proximate result of the criminal act for which the probationer was convicted, or (2) incurred as the result of conduct which is substantially related in kind, including the state of mind of the actor, to the breach for which the individual was criminally convicted.Ã¢ÂÂ
The conclusion is based in part on an observation that: Ã¢ÂÂA majority of jurisdictions in the United States, as well as foreign courts, sanction repa*1257ration by the offender as a condition of probation. A preponderance of these jurisdictions, including the federal judicial system, limit such restitution to the pecuniary harm proximately caused by the act for which the probationer was convictedÃ¢ÂÂ (P. 460, fns. omitted.) The note would expand the probationerÃ¢ÂÂs responsibility to include: . . those debts or injuries which result from conduct substantially related in kind to the criminal conduct, [1] This Ã¢ÂÂin kindÃ¢ÂÂ relationship should be limited solely to those acts which manifest a similar state of mind or intent as that required for the criminal offense.Ã¢ÂÂ (P. 465, italics in original.)
The latter aspect of the suggested test takes into account the California rule that restitution is not limited to Ã¢ÂÂtransactions or amounts of which defendant is actually convicted.Ã¢ÂÂ (People v. Williams, supra, 247 Cal.App.2d at p. 401.)
The desirability of a causative test has been discussed in a number of leading California cases. In People v. Williams, supra, at page 404, the court said: Ã¢ÂÂThere are, however, some suggestions that one proceeding may not be used as a vehicle for imposing restitution or reparation for obligations which may be related to, but which are not directly attributable to, the principal offense.Ã¢ÂÂ And on page 405, citing State v. Scherr (1960) 9 Wis.2d 418, 424, [101 N.W.2d 77]: Ã¢ÂÂ. . . the damages must be directly caused by the acts for which the defendant was convicted, and the amount of restitution must be reasonable.Ã¢ÂÂ And on page 406, the Williams court refers to State v. Barnett (1939) 110 Vt. 221 [3 A.2d 521], a hit-and-run case wherein the court rejected a condition of probation requiring restitution for the damages resulting from the accident, saying: Ã¢ÂÂ. . . Ã¢ÂÂrestitution conditions in probation cases . . . must be for loss sustained as a direct consequence of the particular crime of which the respondent stands convictedÃ¢ÂÂ ... In applying this principle to the facts before it, it determined that the claimed damages from the accident were not the result of the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs failure to stop and render assistance, and that therefore the imposition of the condition of the payment of damages was illegal and void as being against public policy because it made the court in a criminal action a collection agency to enforce a claim of a private nature. ...Ã¢ÂÂ (Citations omitted.)
The Williams court stopped short of adopting a causative test, and said, on pages 407-409: Ã¢ÂÂFrom the foregoing it is concluded that the discretion to be exercised in imposing conditions of probation is not bounded by constitutional limitations, but by the terms of the statute which authorizes the grant of probation and the public policy of that jurisdiction. ... [5] Several factors lead to the conclusion that there should be no hard and fast rule that money payments as a condition of probation be limited to the direct consequences of the particular crime of which defendant stands convicted. In *1258the first place, the California provisions are broader than those considered in the foregoing cases. The statute refers to reparation, an unquestionably broader term than mere restitution. . . . [f] This, however, is not to say that every claim by one victimized directly or indirectly by defendantÃ¢ÂÂs conduct should be granted reparation or restitution, or that the criminal courts should be reduced to collection agencies.Ã¢ÂÂ (Citations omitted.)
In People v. Richards, supra, 17 Cal.3d 614, the Supreme Court comes very close to adopting the causative test suggested by the UCLA Law Review Note, supra, and in the process finds that the holding in the Williams case, if not its language, is consistent with such a test. On page 622, the Richards court says: Ã¢ÂÂIf a restitution order is to redirect a defendant to acceptance of responsibility for the crime he has committed, the order must be directly related to that crime. (People v. Dominguez (1967) supra, 256 Cal.App.2d at p. 628.) It is obvious that unless the act for which the defendant is ordered to make restitution was committed with the same state of mind as the offense of which he was convicted, this salutary rehabilitative effect cannot take place. No rehabilitative purpose can be served by forcing a person to confront tendencies which differ from those which induced his crime. For example, in People v. Williams (1966) supra, 247 Cal.App.2d 394, the defendant assaulted a store proprietor who refused to honor his Diners Club credit card. The Court of Appeal struck down a restitution order requiring the defendant to repay Diners Club for money owed on the credit card. The purpose of restitution in an assault case is to make the defendant accept responsibility for and thus curb his violent tendencies, a purpose that would have justified requiring restitution to the assault victim. But restitution to Diners Club would, at best, cause the defendant to confront his inclination towards fiscal irresponsibility, which is neither related to violence nor criminally punishable in California.Ã¢ÂÂ (Italics added and fns. omitted.)
Other language in Richards is helpful in the analysis of our own case. On page 619 the court says: Ã¢ÂÂTrial courts are granted broad discretion under Penal Code section 1203.1 to prescribe conditions of probation. [Citation omitted.] However, a condition imposed must serve a purpose specified in the code section, [f] This requirement presents no problem for a court ordering a convicted defendant to make restitution to the victim for damages actually caused by the crime. Section 1203.1 expressly allows courts to impose reparation conditions Ã¢ÂÂfor any injury done to any person resulting from such breach.Ã¢ÂÂ A closer question arises, however, when the court imposes a probationary condition requiring a defendant to pay a third party for losses not actually caused by the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs crime. In those circumstances the defendant is in effect required to choose between accepting incarceration and righting a wrong he may not in fact have committed.Ã¢ÂÂ
*1259On page 620, the court observes: Ã¢ÂÂ. . . courts must tread lightly . . . lest they be reduced to Ã¢ÂÂmere collection agenciesÃ¢ÂÂ [Citations omitted], and restitution must in each case be narrowly tailored to serve a purpose described in section 1203.1. [\] The major goal of section 1203.1 is to rehabilitate the criminal. Restitution imposed in a proper case and in an appropriate manner may serve the salutary purpose of making a criminal understand that he has harmed not merely society in the abstract but also individual human beings, and that he has a responsibility to make them whole, [t] But the trial judge herein appeared to posit an additional and ill-conceived purpose: to resolve the civil liability of the criminal. . . . [t] Disposing of civil liability cannot be a function of restitution in a criminal case. To begin with, the criminal justice system is essentially incapable of determining that a defendant is in fact civilly liable, and if so, to what extent. A judge may infer from a jury verdict of guilt in a theft case that a defendant is liable to the crime victim. But a trial court cannot properly conclude that the defendant owes money to a third party for other unproved or disproved crimes or conduct. A party sued civilly has important due process rights, including appropriate pleadings, discovery, and a right to a trial by jury on the specific issues of liability and damages. The judge in the criminal trial should not be permitted to emasculate those rights by simply declaring his belief that the defendant owes a sum of money.Ã¢ÂÂ
On page 621 the court notes: Ã¢ÂÂEven if it can be implied that defendant owes money to Ward, the conclusion does not necessarily follow that he is civilly liable. Civil law, of course, provides for priorities among creditors and rehabilitation of debtors in many cases. No evidence could have been introduced in the criminal trial herein as to whether defendant had declared bankruptcy or other creditors had asserted monetary claims against him superior to that of Ward. Thus 1 Restitution or reparation is not a substitute for a civil action to recover damagesÃ¢ÂÂ [citation omitted], and a defendantÃ¢ÂÂs duty of restitution cannot be predicated merely on a purported debt.Ã¢ÂÂ (Italics added.)
The Supreme Court could have gone on to observe that a condition of restitution can not only deprive defendant of his rights in regard to debt relief, but may also result in giving the third party an unconscionable advantage over other creditors, because a restitution order cannot be canceled by bankruptcy even though the underlying debt is listed in the order. People v. Calhoun (1983) 145 Cal.App.3d 568 [193 Cal.Rptr. 394]. On page 571 Calhoun holds: Ã¢ÂÂIt is, however, well established a restitution order resulting from a criminal conviction is not a Ã¢ÂÂdebt.Ã¢ÂÂ In People v. Washburn (1979) 97 Cal.App.3d 621 [158 Cal.Rptr. 822], the defendant made the exact same claim Calhoun makes here. The court there held a bankruptcy has no effect on a criminal restitution order because such an order does not create a *1260debtor/creditor relationship as the orderÃ¢ÂÂs purpose is to facilitate rehabilitation of the defendant, not to compensate the victim . . . The Washburn analysis is based on the holding of the California Supreme Court in People v. Richards . . . . Ã¢ÂÂ
Applying the reasoning of People v. Richards, supra, 17 Cal.3d 614, several California appellate decisions have reached results similar to State v. Scherr, supra, 9 Wis.2d 418, and State v. Barnett, supra, 110 Vt. 221. In People v. OÃ¢ÂÂRourke (1980) 105 Cal.App.3d Supp. 1 [165 Cal.Rptr. 92], it was held that the trial court abused its discretion in conditioning the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs probation on the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs paying the third party for property damage allegedly caused in the accident from which defendant unlawfully fled.
OÃ¢ÂÂRourke holds on page 4: Ã¢ÂÂThe crime of which defendant was convicted is the intentional act of leaving the scene of an accident in which property damage has occurred. The damage to the third partyÃ¢ÂÂs property was caused by acts which occurred prior to the criminal act, not as a result of the criminal act. There is no evidence in the record to show that the property damage arose from criminal conduct. The restitution order, therefore, requires payment for damage which was caused by noncriminal conduct. Furthermore, requiring the defendant to pay for the alleged property damage is not related to future criminality.Ã¢ÂÂ
On page 6 the OÃ¢ÂÂRourke court held: Ã¢ÂÂIn addition to the concerns noted by the Supreme Court in Richards, under the rule of comparative negligence enunciated in Li v. Yellow Cab Co. (1975) 13 Cal.3d 804 [119 Cal.Rptr. 858, 532 P.2d 1226, 78 A.L.R.3d 393], a civil defendant has the right to raise the defense of comparative negligence which may be significant in a particular case. Furthermore, theoretically, a hit-run defendant may be free of any negligence in causing the accident which precipitated his criminal act of fleeing therefrom.Ã¢ÂÂ
In another case, People v. Corners (1985) 176 Cal.App.3d 139 [221 Cal.Rptr. 387], the court held the trial judge correctly refused to order a hit-run driver to make restitution payments. The court interprets People v. Richards, supra, 17 Cal.3d 614, as mandating a narrow tailoring of restitution under Penal Code section 1203.1 to serve the stated purpose of the statute. The court held that restitution may be imposed only for injuries to a person resulting from a criminal breach of a duty. The court said that an order for payment of restitution cannot be predicated merely on a purported debt to the injured party. Otherwise the result would be to impose civil liability through the back door.
*1261People v. Walmsley (1985) 168 Cal.App.3d 636 [214 Cal.Rptr. 170], cited by the district attorney as holding to the contrary, is distinguishable. In Walmsley the conviction was for felony hit-and-run, wherein the statute requires as an element that a human being be injured. The court said on pages 639-640: Ã¢ÂÂThe gravamen of the offense of hit-and-run driving is the offenderÃ¢ÂÂs attempt to evade responsibility for his actions while driving a motor vehicle. ... It is difficult to imagine a condition of probation more closely linked with rehabilitation of the offender than a condition requiring him to accept the very responsibility he criminally attempted to evade. . . . [ÃÂ] Walmsley was not denied a civil litigantÃ¢ÂÂs due process rights since a civil judgment determining liability and damages was entered prior to the restitution order and referred to by the sentencing judge. Therefore the judge did not determine civil liability.Ã¢ÂÂ (Fn. omitted.)
For another example of a driving offense where restitution is appropriate see People v. Phillips (1985) 168 Cal.App.3d 642 [214 Cal.Rptr. 417]. In this case the defendant had been convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol. There had been an accident. The court ordered the defendant to pay the damages by way of restitution. The order was upheld. The court said on pages 646-650: Ã¢ÂÂGenerally speaking, driving under the influence of alcohol is negligence as a matter of law . . ., and justifies punitive damages in an appropriate case .... When alcohol intoxication contributes to an automobile accident and ensuing injuries, restitution is proper. ... [1] In Richards . . . the trial court appeared to be resolving civil liability, or, put another way, establishing Richards owed a debt. . . . The Supreme Court found this was improper. . . . That did not happen here. The sentencing court specifically said the restitution was for the purpose of rehabilitation. This is strongly supported by the fact there was no attempt to resolve civil liability by determining the full amount of any Ã¢ÂÂdebtÃ¢ÂÂ. ... [1] We cannot say the trial court abused its discretion when it found the manner in which Phillips drove, affected by her intoxication, was a cause of the accident and ensuing injuries. The record supports the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs conclusion. ...Ã¢ÂÂ (Citations omitted.)
Conclusions
We are tempted to support the trial court by looking at the transaction as a whole, and finding that the criminal conduct of the defendant consisted of driving in a negligent manner and with knowledge that his license had been suspended, and that such conduct directly caused injury to another. Thus we could uphold the condition of restitution and square it with the existing case precedent. Such an approach, however, would not be intellectually honest. As we discuss the law of the case we are led to the conclusion that *1262the trial judge mistook an existing condition for a cause, and in consequence adjudicated defendantÃ¢ÂÂs civil liability for damages.
Neither section 1203.1 nor section 1203.04 of the Penal Code support a condition of restitution in this case. The crime of driving on a suspended license does not involve a Ã¢ÂÂvictimÃ¢ÂÂ as such; licensing laws are regulatory by definition. Licensing violations are entirely irrelevant to the determination of the cause of damages.  The condition does not measure up to the standard of People v. Dominguez, supra, 256 Cal.App.2d 623, as that standard is explained by People v. Richards, supra, 17 Cal.3d 614. Because the lack of license was not a cause of the accident it has no relationship to the crime of which defendant was convicted, and does not relate to future criminality. Much like the preexisting debt of People v. Williams, supra, or the set liability for an accident that precedes the crime of hit-and-run, as discussed in People v. OÃ¢ÂÂRourke, supra, 105 Cal.App.3d Supp. 1, and People v. Corners, supra, 176 Cal.App.3d 139 the lack of a license is collateral to the cause of the injury.
Nor can restitution in this case be justified under the reasoning of People v. Richards, supra. It does not directly relate to the crime of driving on a suspended license. The careless turn was not done with the same state of mind inherent in driving without a license. No salutary rehabilitative effect can be realized by making an unlicensed driver an insurer for any damages that may occur in the course of his driving.
In the present case the trial judge did in fact dispose of civil liability by his order of restitution. As a result defendant was denied his due process right of appropriate pleadings, discovery, and a trial by jury on the issues of liability and damages. He was denied his defense of comparative negligence established in Li v. Yellow Cab Co., supra, 13 Cal.3d 804. While it is true that the trial judge made an effort to apportion the loss according to fault, there was no real trial as to the amount of damages that should have been apportioned between the parties, the most obvious of which was the damage to defendantÃ¢ÂÂs vehicle, caused in part by the negligence of the third party.
The conviction for the infraction of failing to yield right of way in violation Vehicle Code section 21801, subdivision (a) does not provide a vehicle for a condition of restitution. While it may literally seem to satisfy the criteria of Dominguez, not only does the de minimis nature of infractions make them ill-suited as an alternative to probation, but more importantly the summary manner in which they are processed make them an entirely inappropriate basis of a probationary order of restitution, and should be *1263against public policy. In any event, in the present case the judgment on the infraction was suspended.
We do not hold that a condition of restitution will always be inappropriate, only that it is inappropriate here. In the present case the defendant was convicted of a violation of Vehicle Code section 14601.1, subdivision (a), which is sometimes referred to as a Ã¢ÂÂsoftÃ¢ÂÂ suspension, i.e., a suspension for reasons other than reckless driving, negligent driving, driving under the influence of intoxicants, etc. We have no reason to believe that the driving causing the damage was with the same state of mind as the driving with a suspended license. In a proper case it may be that such a showing can be made. See People v. Lent, supra, 15 Cal.3d 481.
The words of Justice Sims in People v. Williams, supra, 247 Cal.App.2d at page 409 are applicable: Ã¢ÂÂThe trial judge may not be required to achieve in all cases the sublime results sought by GilbertÃ¢ÂÂs Mikado, but in this case, the effort Ã¢ÂÂto let the punishment fit the crime,Ã¢ÂÂ cannot be supported by authority conferred by statute or existing precedents.Ã¢ÂÂ
We adopt the dispositional language of People v. Richards, supra, 17 Cal.3d at page 624: Ã¢ÂÂThe order admitting defendant to probation on condition that he make restitution ... is reversed. As the court has already determined that defendant is a proper candidate for probation, the case is remanded with directions to grant probation on reasonable conditions.Ã¢ÂÂ
Hastings, P. J., and Creed, J., concurred.

Opinion
SOVEN, J.
The People filed a two-count complaint charging defendant with violations of Vehicle Code sections 23152, subdivision (a) (count I) and 23152, subdivision (b) (count II). The trial court granted defendantÃ¢ÂÂs motion to suppress the results of a breath test because the arresting officer failed to comply with Vehicle Code section 13353.5 (now ÃÂ§ 23157.5).
The People announced that they were unable to proceed on count II, which the court then dismissed Ã¢ÂÂdue to insufficient evidence.Ã¢ÂÂ Count I, however, remains in the trial court awaiting trial. The People, relying on Penal Code section 1466, subdivision (a)(1), appeal from the order dismissing count II. We reverse.
Discussion

Appealability.

Defendant contends that the order of dismissal as to count II is nonappealable. We disagree. Even though defendantÃ¢ÂÂs motion was a non-statutory motion to suppress evidence, the resulting dismissal is appealable. (People v. Mills (1985) 164 Cal.App.3d 652, 655 [210 Cal.Rptr. 669]; People v. Dewberry (1974) 40 Cal.App.3d 175, 182 [114 Cal.Rptr. 815]; see People v. Harris (1976) 62 Cal.App.3d 859, 861-862 [133 Cal.Rptr. 352]; contra, People v. Rawlings (1974) 42 Cal.App.3d 952, 956 [117 Cal.Rptr. 651].) That another count is still pending does not affect the PeopleÃ¢ÂÂs right to appeal. (People v. Agnello (1968) 259 Cal.App.2d 785, 789 [66 Cal.Rptr. 571]; see also People v. Davis (1979) 94 Cal.App.3d 215, 220 [156 Cal.Rptr. 395].)

Suppression of Test Results.

The People contend that the trial court erred in suppressing the breath test results. We agree. Vehicle Code section 13353.5 then provided:
*Supp. 4Ã¢ÂÂ(a). . . [A] person who chooses to submit to a breath test shall be advised before or after the test that the breath-testing equipment does not retain any sample of the breath and that no breath sample will be available after the test which could be analyzed later. . . .
Ã¢ÂÂ(b) The person shall also be advised that, because no breath sample is retained, the person will be given an opportunity to provide a blood or urine sample ... so that there will be something retained that may be subsequently analyzed . . . -Ã¢ÂÂ1
Defendant in this case was advised when he was arrested that he was required to submit to one of three tests, but was not fully advised as required by section 13353.5.2
The trial court, however, erred in suppressing the evidence. We agree with the reasoning and the result in People v. Lyon (1985) 171 Cal.App.3d Supp. 20, 22-24 [218 Cal.Rptr. 290]: Ã¢ÂÂVehicle Code section 13353.5 was enacted as an urgency statute effective September 15, 1983, in response to People v. Trombetta (1983) 142 Cal.App.3d 138 [190 Cal.Rptr. 319], which held at page 144 Ã¢ÂÂDue process demands simply that where evidence is collected by the state, as it is with the intoxilyzer, or any other breath testing device, law enforcement agencies must establish and follow rigorous and systematic procedures to preserve the captured evidence or its equivalent for the use of the defendant.Ã¢ÂÂ
Ã¢ÂÂCalifornia Constitution, article I, section 28, subdivision (d), was enacted by the people as a portion of Proposition 8 on June 8, 1982 and provides inter alia, Ã¢ÂÂ. . . relevant evidence shall not be excluded in any criminal proceedings, including pretrial . . . motions. . . .Ã¢ÂÂ  Article I, section 28, subdivision (d), eliminated Ã¢ÂÂa judicially created remedy for violations of the search and seizure provisions of the federal or state Constitutions, . . . except to the extent that exclusion remains federally compelled. Ã¢ÂÂ (In re Lance W. (1985) 37 Cal.3d 873 at pp. 886-887 [210 Cal.Rptr. 631, 694 P.2d 744], latter italics added.)
Ã¢ÂÂIn 1984 the United States Supreme Court reversed the Trombetta case, holding Ã¢ÂÂthat the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not require that law enforcement agencies preserve breath samples in order to introduce breath-analyses tests at trial.Ã¢ÂÂ (California v. Trombetta *Supp. 5(1984) 467 U.S. 479, at p. 491 [81 L.Ed.2d 413 at p. 423, 104 S.Ct. 2528].) The court held that the process is not fundamentally unfair since defendants are not Ã¢ÂÂwithout alternative means of demonstrating their innocence,Ã¢ÂÂ by way of impeaching the accuracy of the intoxilyzer. (Id., at p. 491 [81 L.Ed.2d at p. 423].) Ã¢ÂÂThe evidence to be presented at trial was not the breath itself but rather the [i]ntoxilyzer results obtained from the breath samples.Ã¢ÂÂ (Id., at p. 488 [81 L.Ed.2d at p. 421].)
Ã¢ÂÂAppellant argues that states are free to set a more stringent due process standard and that California has done so by the enactment of Vehicle Code section 13353.5. The statuteÃ¢ÂÂs language is phrased as a mandatory procedure by the operative word Ã¢ÂÂ shall. Ã¢ÂÂ  Courts will ordinarily refuse to construe the plain meaning of statutes. Nevertheless, it is well settled that courts decline Ã¢ÂÂto follow the plain meaning of a statute . . . when it would inevitably have frustrated the manifest purposes of the legislation as a whole or led to absurd results.Ã¢ÂÂ (People v. Belled (1979) 24 Cal.3d 879, 884 [157 Cal.Rptr. 503, 598 P.2d 473].)
Ã¢ÂÂIt is clear that the Legislature did not intend the statute to raise additional barriers to the admissibility of intoxilyzer testing. The constitutional provision of article I, section 28, subdivision (d), clearly prohibits the exclusion of evidence beyond that required by the supremacy clause of the United States Constitution. (California v. Trombetta, supra, 467 U.S. 479; In re Lance W., supra, 37 Cal.3d 873; see also People v. Mills (1985) 164 Cal.App.3d 652 [210 Cal.Rptr. 669]; and People v. Brannon (1973) 32 Cal.App.3d 971 [108 Cal.Rptr. 520].)
Ã¢ÂÂWhefi viewed in the light of California Constitution, article I, section 8, subdivision (d), and the legislative history of Vehicle Code section 13353.5, it is clear that Vehicle Code section 13353.5 does not have the effect of setting, a due process standard higher than that of the federal Constitution. Since the breath test itself was legally obtained, the appellant has shown no due process violation requiring the prophylactic remedy of the exclusionary rule. The trial court properly denied appellantÃ¢ÂÂs motion to suppress.Ã¢ÂÂ
Although a defendant is not entitled to a suppression order where the People have not complied with section 13353.5 (ÃÂ§ 23157.5), a defendant who submits to a breath test and does not also submit a sample of blood or urine is not without a remedy. Evidence that the officer failed to comply with the law would be admissible, and the defendant would be entitled to a jury instruction, advising the jury of the provisions of section 13353.5 (ÃÂ§ 23157.5), and permitting the jury to consider the officerÃ¢ÂÂs failure to advise the defendant of his rights as a factor bearing on the credibility of
*Supp. 6the officer and the accuracy of the breath test administered by the officer or at his direction.
In this case, there has not yet been a trial. The court erred in suppressing the test results.
The judgment (order of dismissal) is reversed.
Cooperman, P. J., and Reese, J., concurred.

Section 13353.5 was amended and renumbered as Vehicle Code section 23157.5. (Stats. 1985, ch. 735, ÃÂ§ 3.)


Defendant was in fact advised in writing that if he took Ã¢ÂÂa blood or urine test, a sample can be saved for my use,Ã¢ÂÂ and Ã¢ÂÂif I take the breath test, a sample will not be saved and I or my attorney will not have a breath sample to test. ...Ã¢ÂÂ

Opinion
SOVEN, J.
In these cases, defendants were convicted of violating either Business and Professions Code section 16240 (operating a business without a license) or Los Angeles County Code section 7.140.020, subdivision B (engaging in a business with a revoked license). After defendantsÃ¢ÂÂ demurrers to the complaints were overruled, each defendant submitted the matter on facts as stipulated by the parties, was found guilty as charged, and placed on probation on certain conditions. All defendants have appealed. We affirm.
DefendantsÃ¢ÂÂ adult bookstore and movie arcade is subject to Los Angeles County zoning restrictions. We conclude that the standards for the issuance of the required conditional use permit and business license are sufficiently precise to be constitutional, and that defendants have not shown that the procedures to obtain the necessary permit and license result in an impermissible restraint on defendantsÃ¢ÂÂ First-Amendment-protected business.
*Supp. 5Facts
Defendants were employed by Ã¢ÂÂLibrary One,Ã¢ÂÂ an adult bookstore and motion picture arcade located in Los Angeles County. The store and arcade operation did not possess a business license, as required by the Los Angeles County Code.
The Los Angeles County Code (LACC)1 requires an adult bookstore or adult motion picture arcade in Los Angeles County to obtain a business license. The license will be denied if the building, structure or location of the building does not comply with all state and local health, zoning, fire and safety requirements. (ÃÂ§ 7.08.070.) To obtain a license, the operator must first obtain a conditional use permit, which permit includes the condition that the use not be within 1,000 feet of other adult businesses. (ÃÂ§ 22.28.210.)
A conditional use permit must be issued if: 1. The requested use will not Ã¢ÂÂadversely affectÃ¢ÂÂ the use of any place used for religious worship, school, park, playground or similar use within a 500-foot radius (ÃÂ§ 22.56.190, subd. Al); 2. The requested use is Ã¢ÂÂsufficiently bufferedÃ¢ÂÂ with respect to residential areas so as not to Ã¢ÂÂadversely affectÃ¢ÂÂ such areas (ÃÂ§ 22.56.190, subd. A2); 3. The exterior appearance of the structure will Ã¢ÂÂnot be inconsistentÃ¢ÂÂ with the exterior appearance of other commercial structures in the area; so as not to cause Ã¢ÂÂblight, deterioration, or substantially diminish or impair property valuesÃ¢ÂÂ . . . (ÃÂ§ 22.56.190, subd. A3); 4. The proposed use will not be in Ã¢ÂÂsubstantial conflictÃ¢ÂÂ with any general plan for the area (ÃÂ§ 22.56.090, subd. Al);5. The proposed site is adequately sized and shaped to accommodate the developmental features required by section 22.56.090, subdivision A3; 6. The proposed site is adequately served by highways or streets, and any other public or private facilities that may be required. (ÃÂ§ 22.56.090, subd. A4.)2
*Supp. 6The procedures for obtaining, first, the required conditional use permit, and, second, the required business license are described in the discussion.
Discussion

Standing

The record is unclear whether defendantsÃ¢ÂÂ employer, Ã¢ÂÂLibrary One,Ã¢ÂÂ the owner of the adult bookstore and adult movie arcade, recently applied for a conditional use permit and license. We assume that defendants do have standing to challenge the permit and licensing procedures. (See Burton v. Municipal Court (1968) 68 Cal.2d 684, 688 [68 Cal.Rptr. 721, 441 P.2d 281].)

Vagueness of Standards

Defendants contend that the standards for issuing a permit and license are unconstitutionally vague.3 The contention is without merit.
Local governments are entitled to regulate the location of bookstores and motion picture theaters which deal with adult material. (Young v. American *Supp. 7Mini Theatres (1976) 427 U.S. 50, 62-63 [49 L.Ed.2d 310, 321, 96 S.Ct. 2440]. See also, City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc. (1986) 475 U.S. 41 [89 L.Ed.2d 29, 106 S.Ct. 925].) Burton v. Municipal Court, supra, 68 Cal.2d 684, 689, relied on by defendants and discussed below, recognized that although motion pictures were protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments, a Ã¢ÂÂmunicipality may impose reasonable regulations upon the conduct of an economic enterprise [citation] including the business of operating a motion picture theatre. [Citation.]Ã¢ÂÂ
In Young v. American Mini Theatres, supra, 427 U.S. 50, the Supreme Court held valid the classification of a theater as Ã¢ÂÂadultÃ¢ÂÂ and the restriction of Ã¢ÂÂadultÃ¢ÂÂ theaters to areas not less than 1000 feet apart and not less than 500 feet from a residential area. Defendants have no quarrel with those portions of the Los Angeles County Code which restrict defendantsÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ admittedlyÃ¢ÂÂadult bookstore and movie arcade consistent with the ordinances involved in Young. They contend, however, that the language used in the Los Angeles County Ordinances provides no objective standards.
We are obliged to construe enactments to give specific content to terms that might otherwise be unconstitutionally vague; an enactment should not be held void for uncertainty if any reasonable and practical construction can be given the enactment. (Pryor v. Municipal Court (1979) 25 Cal.3d 238, 253 [158 Cal.Rptr. 330, 599 P.2d 636].) Burton v. Municipal Court, supra, 68 Cal.2d 684, 692, states that the issue is whether the ordinances provide Ã¢ÂÂprecise standards capable of objective measurement. ...Ã¢ÂÂ  Although the bulk of the standards involved cannot be numerically quantified, we conclude that an objective but unquantified standard is not unconstitutionally vague.
In examining the language which creates the standard, the question is whether the ordinance Ã¢ÂÂclearly and precisely delineates its reach in words of common understanding.Ã¢ÂÂ (Cameron v. Johnson (1968) 390 U.S. 611, 616 [20 L.Ed.2d 182, 187, 88 S.Ct. 1335].) An ordinance is not vague or subjective if the drafters have chosen Ã¢ÂÂwidely used and well understoodÃ¢ÂÂ words. (Kash Enterprises, Inc. v. City of Los Angeles (1977) 19 Cal.3d 294, 304 [138 Cal.Rptr. 53, 562 P.2d 1302].)
Defendants isolate three required findings under section 22.56.190: The requested use Ã¢ÂÂwill not adversely affectÃ¢ÂÂ a place of religious worship, school, park, playground or similar use within a 500-foot radius; the requested use must be Ã¢ÂÂsufficiently bufferedÃ¢ÂÂ in relation to residentially zoned areas Ã¢ÂÂso as not to adversely affectÃ¢ÂÂ those areas, and the exterior appearance Ã¢ÂÂwill not be inconsistent with the external appearance of commercial struc*Supp. 8turesÃ¢ÂÂ within the area Ã¢ÂÂso as to cause blight, deterioration, or substantially diminish or impair property values within the neighborhood.Ã¢ÂÂ
Our Supreme Court analyzed comparable language in Kash Enterprises, Inc. v. City of Los Angeles, supra, 19 Cal. 3d 294, in ruling on the constitutionality of ordinances regulating newsracks. The court concluded that phrases such as, Ã¢ÂÂunreasonably interferes with or impedesÃ¢ÂÂ (19 Cal.3d at p. 303), and Ã¢ÂÂclean,Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂneatÃ¢ÂÂ and Ã¢ÂÂin good repairÃ¢ÂÂ (id., at p. 305) involved common and widely used words, and were sufficiently precise to be constitutional.
Applying the Kash method of analysis to this case, we construe the requirement that a use Ã¢ÂÂnot adversely affectÃ¢ÂÂ another use to mean that the adult bookstore and arcade will not interfere with other uses; that sounds from the bookstore cannot be heard from other uses; that the bookstore will not be conspicuously visible from the other uses, and that the bookstore is located so that customers are not likely to inadvertently wander on the property of other uses.
The phrase, Ã¢ÂÂwill not be inconsistent with the external appearance of commercial structuresÃ¢ÂÂ also in the area, is also sufficiently clear. It means that the external design and decor of the adult bookstore and movie arcade will not be conspicuous in relation to other commercial uses; and that the exterior lighting and signs are similar to the exterior lighting and signs of other commercial establishments in the area.
Concededly, the phrase Ã¢ÂÂso as to cause blight, deterioration or substantially diminish or impair property value within the neighborhood,Ã¢ÂÂ may lack precision, but we construe this phrase simply to restate the standard that the exterior appearance Ã¢ÂÂwill not be inconsistentÃ¢ÂÂ with the exterior appearance of other commercial establishments, and thus avoid impermissible vagueness. (See Kash Enterprises, Inc. v. City of Los Angeles, supra, 19 Cal.3d 294, 305.)
The cases relied on by defendants involve ordinances in which the courts found the standards to be subjective, imprecise, and conferring on the authorities excessive discretion.
In Burton v. Municipal Court, supra, 68 Cal.2d 684, the defendants were charged with exhibiting motion picture films to the public without a written permit from the Board of Police Commissioners. The applicable ordinances provided that the board Ã¢ÂÂmay denyÃ¢ÂÂ a permit if after an investigation the board found that the Ã¢ÂÂoperation will not comport with the peace, health, safety, convenience, good morals, and general welfare of the public.Ã¢ÂÂ The *Supp. 9ordinances also provided that the board Ã¢ÂÂshall not issue a permit for a business which has been or is a public nuisance,Ã¢ÂÂ or if the applicant is Ã¢ÂÂunfit to be trusted with the privileges granted by such permit, or has a bad moral character, intemperate habits or a bad reputation for truth, honesty, or integrity.Ã¢ÂÂ (68 Cal.2d at p. 687.)
In Ebel v. City of Garden Grove (1981) 120 Cal.App.3d 399 [176 Cal.Rptr. 312], the local ordinances governing the operation of an adult book store or movie theater included a requirement that the applicant obtain a conditional use permit. The stated purpose in deciding whether to issue a conditional use permit was to Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂassure that the degree of compatibility made the purpose of this Chapter shall be maintained with respect to the particular use on the particular site and in consideration of other existing and potential uses and improvements within the general area in which such is proposed to be located,Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ and Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂto recognize and compensate for variations and degree of technological processes and equipment as related to the factors of noise, smoke, dust, fumes, vibration, odors, and hazard or public need.Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ (120 Cal.App.3d at pp. 405-406.)
In City of Imperial Beach v. Escott (1981) 115 Cal.App.3d 134 [171 Cal.Rptr. 197], the local ordinances regulating adult bookstores and movie theaters also required that the applicant obtain a conditional use permit. The ordinance provided that Ã¢ÂÂthe Planning Commission may, by resolution, grant a conditional use permit,Ã¢ÂÂ if the commission found that the proposed use Ã¢ÂÂis necessary or desirable to provide a service or facility which will contribute to the general well-being of the neighborhood or communityÃ¢ÂÂ; that the use would not Ã¢ÂÂbe detrimental to the health, safety, or general welfare of persons residing or working in the vicinity, or injurious to property or improvements in the vicinityÃ¢ÂÂ; that the proposed use would comply with the Ã¢ÂÂregulations and conditionsÃ¢ÂÂ and that the granting of the conditional use would be Ã¢ÂÂin harmony with the purpose and intent of this title and the general plan of the city.Ã¢ÂÂ (115 Cal.App.3d, at pp. 137-138.)
There is, however, no comparison between the Los Angeles County Code standards, which govern exclusively the physical appearance and relationship of the adult book store and adult movie arcade to other uses, and the moralistic litany in Burton v. Municipal Court, supra, 68 Cal.2d 684, or the rambling statements of purpose in Ebel v. City of Garden Grove, supra, 120 Cal.App.3d 399 and City of Imperial Beach v. Escott, supra, 115 Cal.App.3d 134, all of which, in addition, conferred on the issuing authority unlimited discretion to deny a permit or license.
In brief, the Los Angeles County zoning requirements for an adult bookstore or adult movie theater or arcade are not unconstitutionally vague.

*Supp. 10
Procedural safeguards

Defendants contend that even if the substance of the ordinances passes constitutional scrutiny, the procedures involved in obtaining a conditional use permit and license constitute an impermissible prior restraint. We do not agree that the procedures are unconstitutional.
An operator must, as noted, apply for and obtain, first, a conditional use permit, and second, a business license. The procedures in the Los Angeles County Code are as follows: Conditional use permit (ÃÂ§ 22.28.210). A public hearing must be held. (ÃÂ§ 22.56.070.) No time limit is specified within which to hold the hearing after filing. (ÃÂ§ 22.56.1570.) The hearing may be held by either the zoning board or the business license commission. (ÃÂ§ 22.56.1590.) If the zoning board holds the initial hearing, that board must submit recommendations to the commission within 90 days after the hearing. (ÃÂ§ 22.56.1610.) The commission may approve the findings of the zoning board, refer the matter back to the board for further hearing or set the matter for a de novo public hearing before itself. (ÃÂ§ 22.56.1620.) No time limit is specified for a de novo hearing, or for the issuance of a decision after the hearing. (See ÃÂ§ 22.56.1620, subd. A4.) A recommendation of the zoning board becomes final if the commission takes no action within 30 days. (ÃÂ§ 22.56.1630.)
A dissatisfied applicant for a conditional use permit may appeal to the board of supervisors. (ÃÂ§ 22.60.200.) The board of supervisors may affirm the decision of the commission, refer the matter back for further proceedings or set the matter for a de novo hearing. (ÃÂ§ 22.60.270.) No time limit is specified for action by the board of supervisors.
Business license. Before an applicant can obtain a business license, a public hearing must be held. (ÃÂ§ 7.06.040.) The commission may submit the matter to a referee to take testimony and report his findings. (ÃÂ§ 7.10.020.) The referee is required within three days after the hearing to submit a written report to the commission. (ÃÂ§ 7.10.320.) The applicant is entitled to have the matter heard by the full commission. (ÃÂ§ 7.10.070.) In that case, the hearing must be held at the commissionÃ¢ÂÂs next regular meeting. (ÃÂ§ 7.10.080.) No time limit is specified for holding the next regular meeting.
Defendants contend, relying on Freedman v. Maryland (1965) 380 U.S. 51 [13 L.Ed.2d 649, 85 S.Ct. 734], that the applicable ordinances lack constitutionally required procedural safeguards. The People contend that Freedman does not apply.
*Supp. 11Freedman involved a censorship ordinance. The court held that a Ã¢ÂÂnoncriminal process which requires the prior submission of a film to a censor avoids constitutional infirmity only if it takes place under procedural safeguards designed to obviate the dangers of a censorship system. First, the burden of proving that the film is unprotected expression must rest on the censor.Ã¢ÂÂ Second, Ã¢ÂÂthe exhibitor must be assured, by statute or authoritative judicial construction, that the censor will, within a specified brief period, either issue a license or go to court to restrain showing the film.Ã¢ÂÂ (Id., at pp. 58-59 [13 L.Ed.2d at pp. 654-655].) The censorship scheme in Freedman applied to all films, regardless of content or classification.
The People rely on Bayside Enterprises, Inc. v. Carson (M.D.Fla. 1979) 470 F.Supp. 1140, which involved a local licensing code regulating adult entertainment. The operators, relying on Freedman, argued that the administrative procedure for judicial review of license denials or revocations was constitutionally defective in that the burden was on the applicant to seek review of an adverse administrative decision and the procedure contained inadequate Ã¢ÂÂguaranties of promptness and finality.Ã¢ÂÂ The District Court disagreed that Freedman applied: Ã¢ÂÂFreedman and its progeny deal with the procedures of expedited judicial review, with the burden on the censor, that must accompany governmental restraint upon the dissemination of a particular publication. . . . Under the Code ... in this caseÃ¢ÂÂa licenseeÃ¢ÂÂs alleged distribution of obscene materials will not furnish grounds for revoking his license, or for denying him a license to begin with. The only permissible grounds for that action would be violations in such areas as sanitation, dangerous physical conditions, or the like. In other words, official action on a license application or an existing license would flow from a failure to observe minimum standards of health and safety, and the violator would be subject to official sanction just like any other business. Under these conditions, the Freedman cases are simply inapposite.Ã¢ÂÂ (470 F.Supp. at p. 1149.)
We agree that the procedures approved in Freedman do not apply to the licensing under a zoning ordinance of a theater or bookstore. Constitutional issues aside, the simple determination by a censoring body whether a film is obscene cannot be equated with the many factors involved in determining whether a theater or bookstore complies with specified standards of health and safety. More important, the purpose of the licensing and permit procedures is not to censor the material to be exhibited or sold, but to assure that the proposed use complies with all requirements. The burden is on the applicant to present the necessary proofs that the proposed operation does comply with all lawful requirements.
Second, although any interference with the exhibition or sale of protected material can be viewed as Ã¢ÂÂprior restraint,Ã¢ÂÂ Young v. American *Supp. 12Mini Theatres, supra, 427 U.S. 50, recognized that a prior restraint on the exhibition of a film was not equivalent to a restriction through zoning on the theater which exhibits the films. In rejecting the contention that the zoning ordinances involved in Young were invalid as prior restraints on free speech, the Supreme Court noted that the Ã¢ÂÂordinances are not challenged on the ground that they impose a limit on the total number of theatres which may operate in the city of Detroit,Ã¢ÂÂ that there was Ã¢ÂÂno claim that distributors or exhibitors of adult films are denied access to the market, or, conversely, that the viewing public is unable to satisfy its appetite for sexually explicit fare,Ã¢ÂÂ and that Ã¢ÂÂthe market for this commodity is essentially unrestrained.Ã¢ÂÂ (427 U.S. at p. 62 [49 L.Ed.2d at p. 321].)
More recently, City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., supra, 475 U.S. 41, Ã¢ÂÂ [89 L.Ed.2d 29, 42] which relied on and approved Young, made clear that mere economic costs in finding a lawful location do not constitute an unconstitutional infringement on the dissemination of protected material. Thus, the fact that the permit and licensing procedures may be lengthy, may inconvenience the operators of adult theaters and bookstores, and may increase the business costs for such operations will not invalidate a licensing procedure that otherwise is not unfair.
Finally, Young recognized that erotic material was not entitled to the same quantum of protection as other protected material: Ã¢ÂÂMoreover, even though we recognize that the First Amendment will not tolerate the total suppression of erotic materials that have some arguably artistic value, it is manifest that societyÃ¢ÂÂs interest in protecting this type of expression is of a wholly different, and lesser, magnitude than the interest in untrammeled political debate . . . Even though the First Amendment protects communication in this area from total suppression, we hold that the State may legitimately use the content of these materials as the basis for placing them in a different classification from other motion pictures. Ã¢ÂÂ (427 U.S. at pp. 70-71 [49 L.Ed.2d at p. 326].)
Inevitably, Young leads to the conclusion that the procedures required by Freedman do not apply to the licensing under zoning laws of the adult bookstore and movie arcade involved in this case. Indeed even Burton v. Municipal Court, supra, 68 Cal.2d 684, otherwise relied on by defendants, in acknowledging the legitimacy of regulations Ã¢ÂÂcompelling the theatre building to satisfy health fire and safety laws, or requiring the operation of the business to comply with the law in other specific respectsÃ¢ÂÂ (68 Cal.2d at p. 696), necessarily envisioned a procedure in which the burden would be on the exhibitor to show compliance with proper requirements.
Concededly, permit and licensing procedures can be used to effectively prevent an undesired but lawful operation from functioning. (See 414 *Supp. 13Theatre Corp. v. Murphy (2d Cir. 1974) 499 F.2d 1155, 1159.) We recognize too that the Supreme Court still recognizes the protected position of Ã¢ÂÂadultÃ¢ÂÂ material. In Vance v. Universal Amusement Co. (1980) 445 U.S. 308 [63 L.Ed.2d 413, 100 S.Ct. 1156], for example, the court held unconstitutional a Texas public nuisance statute used to shut down an adults-only motion picture theater based on a prior finding that the theater had shown obscene films. The court held that Ã¢ÂÂthe regulation of a communicative activity such as the exhibition of motion pictures must adhere to more narrowly drawn procedures than is necessary for the abatement of an ordinary nuisance ...Ã¢ÂÂ (445 U.S. at p. 315 [63 L.Ed.2d at p. 420].) Also, several federal courts of appeal cases have assumed that Freedman applied to some degree to the licensing of adult bookstores or theaters. (See Entertainment Concepts, Inc., III v. Maciejewski (7th Cir. 1980) 631 F.2d 497, 505-506; Bayou Landing, Ltd. v. Watts (5th Cir. 1977) 563 F.2d 1172, 1176; 414 Theatre Corp. v. Murphy, supra, 499 F.2d 1155, 1159.)
Although the LACC permit and licensing procedures lack time limits for all the necessary steps, in the absence of a specific time limit, a reasonable time will be inferred. (See, e.g., Stratton v. Tejani (1982) 139 Cal.App.3d 204, 211 [187 Cal.Rptr. 231].) Moreover, the code does contain some time limits (see ÃÂ§ 22.56.1630 [30 days for commission to act on zoning board recommendation]; ÃÂ§ 7.10.320 [referee to report to commission within three days]), which provide a basis for establishing time limits as to other steps.
More important, defendants have not provided this court with any meaningful record concerning delays in obtaining a permit and license. The reason that the owner of the arcade and bookstore does not have a permit and license is not clear. The burden is on the owner to initiate the necessary proceedings, and, on this limited record, we are not prepared to hold that the county will impermissibly delay, assuming the owner establishes his entitlement, in granting a permit and license.
The judgments are affirmed.

Opinion
COOPERMAN, P. J.
The People appeal from an order dismissing counts I and II of the complaint against defendant Tofi George Stephen.
*Supp. 17The record reflects the following relevant chronology of events: On September 1, 1983, a three-count-misdemeanor complaint was filed charging defendant, respectively, with violating Penal Code sections 487, subdivision (1) (grand theft), 496 (receiving stolen property), and 148.5 (filing a false report of a criminal offense). Specifically, defendant was alleged in count I to have stolen personal property worth $3,000 belonging to one Dali Christensen and in count II to have bought, received, etc., stolen property, i.e., a 15 gallon air bottle, refacing machine, stone sharpener, gray tool box, reamers and grinding tool, orange tool box, miscellaneous grinding stone, and sandblasting machine. With regard to count III he was alleged to have filed a police report that a felony had been committed with knowledge that such report was false.
On September 7, 1983, a hearing was held with respect to a civil compromise proposed by the court concerning the grand theft and receiving stolen property charges. In pertinent part the docket entry simply reads: Ã¢ÂÂCounts 1 and 2 Court grants Civil Compromise pursuant to 1378 P.C.Ã¢ÂÂ No reasons were specified nor facts set forth which would elucidate why the court considered a civil compromise to be proper in this instance.
On September 10, 1984, count III was dismissed for lack of a speedy trial.
I.
On appeal1 the PeopleÃ¢ÂÂs sole assignment of error concerns the dismissal of counts I and II.  Their initial position is that the order dismissing those counts must be reversed on the ground that the trial court failed to set forth its reasons for the civil compromise in the minutes (docket).2
We find the PeopleÃ¢ÂÂs position in this respect to be meritorious and reverse for that reason.3
*Supp. 18The statutory authority for compromising certain misdemeanor public offenses by leave of court is set forth in Penal Code sections 1377 through 1379.4 Section 1379 strictly prohibits any public offense from being compromised or the proceeding stayed upon a compromise unless it is done in compliance with sections 1377 and 1378.
Section 1377 provides: Ã¢ÂÂWhen the person injured by an act constituting a misdemeanor has a remedy by a civil action, the offense may be compromised as provided in the next section, except when it is committed: [K] 1. By or upon an officer of justice, while in the execution of the duties of his office; [1f] 2. Riotously; [U] 3. With an intent to commit a felony; [H] 4. In violation of any court order as described in Section 273.6, unless the offense charged is the first such offense committed by the defendant against the family or household member under Section 273.6.Ã¢ÂÂ
Section 1378 provides: Ã¢ÂÂIf the person injured appears before the court in which the action is pending at any time before trial, and acknowledges that he has received satisfaction for the injury, the court may, in its discretion, on payment of the costs incurred, order all proceedings to be stayed upon the prosecution, and the defendant to be discharged therefrom; but in such case the reasons for the order must be set forth therein, and entered on the minutes. The order is a bar to another prosecution for the same offense.Ã¢ÂÂ (Italics added.)
The legal consequence of a courtÃ¢ÂÂs failure to set forth its reasons for a civil compromise in the minutes pivots on the meaning of the word Ã¢ÂÂmust.Ã¢ÂÂ If the import of Ã¢ÂÂmustÃ¢ÂÂ in section 1378 is mandatory, rather than directory, then the courtÃ¢ÂÂs failure to set forth its reasoning in an order entered on the minutes renders the order invalid. (See, e.g., People v. Franklin (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d Supp. 13, 15-16 [149 Cal.Rptr. 229]; People v. Orin (1975) 13 Cal.3d 937, 943-945 [120 Cal.Rptr. 65, 533 P.2d 193]; People v. Superior Court (Schomer) (1970) 13 Cal.App.3d 672, 678-679 [91 Cal.Rptr. 651]; People v. Beasley (1970) 5 Cal.App.3d 617, 638 [85 Cal.Rptr. 501]; see also, People v. Watson (1983) 146 Cal.App.3d 12, 18 [193 Cal.Rptr. 849].)
Ordinarily, words such as Ã¢ÂÂmustÃ¢ÂÂ and Ã¢ÂÂshallÃ¢ÂÂ are perceived as conveying a mandatory or an imperative connotation in the obligatory sense. (See, e.g., People v. Municipal Court (Lozano) (1956) 145 Cal.App.2d 767, 778 [303 P.2d 375]; People v. Callegri (1984) 154 Cal.App.3d 856, 866 [202 Cal.Rptr. 109].) However, the fact Ã¢ÂÂ[t]hat the statute is couched in obligatory language is not decisive. Ã¢ÂÂMany statutory provisions which are Ã¢ÂÂmandatoryÃ¢ÂÂ *Supp. 19in the obligatory sense are accorded only directory effect.Ã¢ÂÂ [Citation.]Ã¢ÂÂ (Watson, supra, at p. 18.)
In Skelly Estate Co. v. San Francisco (1937) 9 Cal.2d 28 [69 P.2d 171], the California Supreme Court explained that Ã¢ÂÂ[t]he general use of the word Ã¢ÂÂmustÃ¢ÂÂ in an act does not ipso facto make the provision mandatory. . . . Ã¢ÂÂThe use of the word Ã¢ÂÂmustÃ¢ÂÂ is not necessarily determinative of its mandatory import. The words Ã¢ÂÂshallÃ¢ÂÂ and Ã¢ÂÂmustÃ¢ÂÂ are frequently construed as directory terms. [Citations.]Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ. (Id., at p. 33.)
Ã¢ÂÂIt is a cardinal rule that statutes should be given a reasonable interpretation and in accordance with the apparent purpose and intention of the law makers.Ã¢ÂÂ (People v. Ashley (1971) 17 Cal.App.3d 1122, 1127 [95 Cal.Rptr. 509].)
Ã¢ÂÂThe test is this: Ã¢ÂÂIf to construe [Ã¢ÂÂmustÃ¢ÂÂ] as directory would render [the statute] ineffective and meaningless it should not receive that construction.Ã¢ÂÂ [Citations.] Thus, a statute was held to be mandatory where Ã¢ÂÂto construe this provision of the section as directory merely would be to defeat the very purpose of its enactment. Ã¢ÂÂ [Citations.] Ã¢ÂÂ. . . [I]t appears that if public policy is in favor of the imperative meaning, the words referred to will be held mandatory.Ã¢ÂÂ [Citations.]Ã¢ÂÂ (People v. Municipal Court (Lozano), supra, 145 Cal.App.2d at p. 775, cited with approval in People v. Callegri, supra, 154 Cal.App.3d 856 at pp. 866-867.)
It is therefore incumbent on us to ascertain the purpose and intent surrounding the civil compromise statute at hand before proceeding further with our analysis of the word Ã¢ÂÂmustÃ¢ÂÂ in section 1378.
In People v. Moulton (1982) 131 Cal.App.3d Supp. 10 [182 Cal.Rptr. 761] we had occasion to examine the background and purpose of the subject statute. Specifically, we made the following observations: Ã¢ÂÂIn most instances, the civil and criminal law operate independently of one another so that resolution of a victimÃ¢ÂÂs civil rights and remedies has no effect upon criminal prosecution. [Citation.] Indeed, it is generally considered to be a criminal offense to condition settlement of a civil claim upon nonprosecution of a criminal action. [Citations.] It is only when there has been compliance with a civil compromise statute authorizing a settlement under the supervision of the court that such a disposition is permitted. [Citation.]Ã¢ÂÂ (Id., at Supp. pp. 19-20.)
We also identified the policy underlying civil compromise statutes as the promotion of the public interest by checking rather than encouraging criminal prosecutions of cases which are in reality of a private rather than public *Supp. 20nature, although they are technically labeled as public offenses. (Id,., at Supp. p. 20.)
In enacting the subject civil compromise statute the Legislature empowered the trial court with discretion to dismiss criminal charges stemming from that class of misdemeanor offenses in which a remedy by a civil action is available to the victim5 but only on the conditions that costs be paid and the victim acknowledges before the court that he has received satisfaction for the injury. The imposition of such restraints clearly reflects the LegislatureÃ¢ÂÂs intent to circumscribe the exercise of discretion by the trial court in approving civil compromises.
Properly presented, the issue here is whether construing the word Ã¢ÂÂmustÃ¢ÂÂ in section 1378 to be mandatory rather than directory would best serve to carry out the purpose of the civil compromise statute and effectuate the LegislatureÃ¢ÂÂs intent.
Although no case or statutory authority has interpreted the word Ã¢ÂÂmustÃ¢ÂÂ in the context of section 1378, we find guidance in the reasoning and analysis of those cases interpreting the word Ã¢ÂÂmustÃ¢ÂÂ in the analogously worded provision in section 1385.
Section 1385 reads in pertinent part: Ã¢ÂÂThe judge . . . may ... of its own motion . . . and in the furtherance of justice, order an action to be dismissed. The reasons of the dismissal must be set forth in an order entered upon the minutes. ...Ã¢ÂÂ (Italics added.)
Ã¢ÂÂThe trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs discretion to dismiss pursuant to section 1385 is very broad [citations], ... On the other hand, the furtherance of justice requires that justice be done to the PeopleÃ¢ÂÂs interests as well as to the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs. [Citations.]Ã¢ÂÂ (People v. Borousk (1972) 24 Cal.App.3d 147, 163 [100 Cal.Rptr. 867].) Additionally, Ã¢ÂÂ[i]n the light of the importance to the administration of criminal justice of not having a case brought by the People . . . thrown out of court except for a reason which can be said to be that which would motivate a reasonable judge,. . . a judge does not have absolute discretion to dismiss a criminal case.Ã¢ÂÂ (People v. Curtiss (1970) 4 *Supp. 21Cal.App.3d 123, 126 [84 Cal.Rptr. 106], cited with approval in People v. Fretwell (1970) 8 Cal.App.3d Supp. 37, at Supp. p. 41 [87 Cal.Rptr. 356].)
Ã¢ÂÂThe purpose behind the requirement for specification of reasons in the minutes has been stated to be: to protect the interests of the public (People v. Superior Court [Howard], 69 Cal.2d 491, 496, fn. 3 [72 Cal.Rptr. 330, 446 P.2d 138]), to protect the public interests against improper or corrupt dismissals (People v. Silva, 236 Cal.App.2d 453, 455 [46 Cal.Rptr. 87]), to restrain judicial discretion and curb arbitrary action for undisclosed reasons and motives (People v. Ritchie [(1971)] 17 Cal.App.3d 1098, 1105 [95 Cal.Rptr. 462]), and to enable the appellate court to determine whether discretion has been properly exercised (People v. Beasley [(1970)] 5 Cal.App.3d 617, 637 [85 Cal.Rptr. 501]).Ã¢ÂÂ (People v. McAlonan (1972) 22 Cal.App.3d 982, 986 [99 Cal.Rptr. 733].)
The principal purposes, however, are clearly to protect the public interests against improper or corrupt dismissals and Ã¢ÂÂto restrain judicial discretion and curb arbitrary action for undisclosed reasons and motives.Ã¢ÂÂ (People v. Ritchie (1971) 17 Cal.App.3d 1098, 1105 [95 Cal.Rptr. 462]; People v. Orin, supra, 13 Cal.3d 937, 944.)
Ã¢ÂÂIt is settled law that this provision is mandatory and not merely directory. . . . [K] Thus, it has been said: Ã¢ÂÂThe statement of reasons is not merely directory, and neither trial nor appellate courts have authority to disregard the requirement. It is not enough that on review the reporterÃ¢ÂÂs transcript may show the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs motivation; the minutes must reflect the reason Ã¢ÂÂso that all may know why this great power was exercised.Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ [Citations.]Ã¢ÂÂ (People v. Orin, supra, 13 Cal.3d 937, 944; accord, People v. Franklin, supra, 84 Cal.App.3d Supp. 13, 15-16.)
Ã¢ÂÂThe statute does not say and the cases have not allowed the interpretation that Ã¢ÂÂthe reasons shall appear somewhere in the record.Ã¢ÂÂ There is a difference between minutes of the court and oral pronouncement. Thus even if [the court] expressed valid reasons which may appear in the record, for example, in the transcript of what is said, if those reasons do not appear in the minutes the mandatory requirements have not been met.Ã¢ÂÂ (People v. Andrade (1978) 86 Cal.App.3d 963, 974-975 [150 Cal.Rptr. 662].)
Ã¢ÂÂA specification of reasons couched in conclusionary language, and which fails to set out the factual basis upon which the conclusions are reached, thwarts the very purpose of the statutory requirement and fails to give effect to the legislative intent behind it. . . . Ã¢ÂÂLacking any factual content, it [the order] offers no appropriate gauge by which we may test the propriety of the exercise of discretion.Ã¢ÂÂ [Citation.] More important, the order provides *Supp. 22an inadequate basis for public scrutiny, because its propriety cannot be judged without reference to the entire record. [Such] order [is] invalid because it fail[s] to set out the factual basis upon which it was made. [Citation.]Ã¢ÂÂ (People v. McAlonan, supra, 22 Cal.App.3d 982, 986.)
From the foregoing we glean these general principles: In certain specified situations the Legislature has determined that instead of criminal convictions the public interest would be best served by dismissal of certain criminal charges in the discretion of the trial court. That discretion, however, is not absolute. As a safeguard against abuse the Legislature dictates that the exercise of such discretion be conditioned upon the statement of the reasons, i.e., the factual basis, justifying such dismissal in the minutes. The rationale behind requiring the reasons to be set forth in the minutes as contrasted with allowing them to be placed in a settled statement or to be transcribed from a reporterÃ¢ÂÂs notes is to ensure that the reasons are readily ascertainable and available to the public and the reviewing court.
Applying these principles to the subject civil compromise statute, we conclude: The Legislature intended to empower the trial court, in its discretion, to compromise certain misdemeanor offenses where a civil remedy is available to the victim, the victim acknowledges before the court that he has received satisfaction for the injury, and costs are paid. In order to protect the public against abuses of discretion, however, the Legislature requires that when the court exercises its discretion to compromise the matter Ã¢ÂÂthe reasons for the order must be set forth therein, and entered on the minutes.Ã¢ÂÂ (Pen. Code, ÃÂ§ 1378, italics added.)
It is clear that Ã¢ÂÂmustÃ¢ÂÂ in section 1378 can only be imbued with a mandatory meaning, rather than a directory one, in order to effectuate the LegislatureÃ¢ÂÂs intent to protect the public against abuses of discretion. If the word Ã¢ÂÂmustÃ¢ÂÂ were construed to be simply directory, then the public would not know the reasons, if any, for a civil compromise where none were set forth in the minutes unless and until a reporterÃ¢ÂÂs transcript or a settled statement were prepared. A reporterÃ¢ÂÂs transcript, however, would necessitate the presence of a reporter at the proceedings and the availability of the reporterÃ¢ÂÂs notes, which might become lost or destroyed over a period of time. A settled statement presupposes an appeal and the availability of the judge who compromised the matter. These prerequisites, however, are not always present,  The Legislature clearly conditioned the exercise of discretion to compromise a criminal offense on the placement of the reasons for such compromise in the minutes in order to obviate the need to rely upon such happenstances as the availability of a reporterÃ¢ÂÂs transcript or a settled statement.
In the present case the minutes do not reveal any reason for the approval of a civil compromise as to counts I (grand theft) and II (receiving stolen *Supp. 23goods). Although the words Ã¢ÂÂcivil compromiseÃ¢ÂÂ in the minutes identify the ground for dismissal of those counts, the minutes are silent concerning the factual basis for approving the civil compromise. The order of dismissal as to counts I and II is therefore invalid. (People v. McAlonan, supra, 22 Cal.App.3d at p. 986.)
The factual basis which would justify the approval of a civil compromise necessarily includes the following determinations by the court: (1) the misdemeanor offense sought to be compromised falls within that class of crimes subject to being compromised, i.e., the victim has a remedy by a civil action and no exception applies, e.g., the offense was not committed with felonious intent (ÃÂ§ 1377); (2) the victim appeared before the court and acknowledged that he has received satisfaction for the injury (ÃÂ§ 1378); and (3) defendant paid the incurred costs (ÃÂ§ 1378).
II.
The People also take the position that the order dismissing counts I and II should be reversed for the alternative reason, on the merits, that the victim did not acknowledge that he had received satisfaction for his injury.
We disagree. The record refutes this assertion. In relevant part the reporterÃ¢ÂÂs transcript of the civil compromise proceedings reveals that the following transpired:
Ã¢ÂÂThe Court: All right. LetÃ¢ÂÂs call the matter of Tofi George Stephen.
Ã¢ÂÂMr. Christianson is here?
Ã¢ÂÂMr. Jacinto [prosecutor]: Yes, Your Honor.
Ã¢ÂÂThe Court: Will you come forward, please. I askedÃ¢ÂÂit was me, not the prosecutor who asked you to come in this afternoon. I want to see if we could resolve one thing. IÃ¢ÂÂd like to save you from coming back again.
Ã¢ÂÂIt is alleged in the two counts, items were stolen fromÃ¢ÂÂeither stolen from you or held by someone after they had been stolen, and IÃ¢ÂÂve been informed that youÃ¢ÂÂve received the property back.
Ã¢ÂÂMr. Christianson [victim]: Yes, your Honor.
Ã¢ÂÂThe Court: Is that correct?
Ã¢ÂÂMr. Christianson: Yes.
*Supp. 24Ã¢ÂÂThe Court: IÃ¢ÂÂd like to know what your view is and position is, whether you would like this matter to continue or feel this matter has been taken care of, as far as youÃ¢ÂÂre concerned, the theft part of it.
Ã¢ÂÂMr. Christianson: Well, I havenÃ¢ÂÂt been pressing the matter. The police have asked if I would be a witness. IÃ¢ÂÂve told them I would be a witness.
Ã¢ÂÂThe Court: Yes, I understand.
Ã¢ÂÂMr. Christianson: So whatever the court decides, IÃ¢ÂÂll go along with it.
Ã¢ÂÂThe Court: Do you have any objection of this matter being compromised, short of a conviction?
Ã¢ÂÂMr. Christianson: No.
Ã¢ÂÂThe Court: Have you received all injury back from this matter?
Ã¢ÂÂMr. Christianson: No, not really. Because while these tools were not in my possession for my use, I had to go out and purchase some others. I did not replace the entire thing, but I did spend in the neighborhood of $500.00 to $550.00 in buying some special tools, which are now a duplicate, and IÃ¢ÂÂm out that money.
Ã¢ÂÂI also lost work while the tools were not available to me.
Ã¢ÂÂThe Court: Mr. Hale, do you have some comments?
Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢ÂÂd like to see if this could be compromised today. I donÃ¢ÂÂt know about all of that.
Ã¢ÂÂMr. Hale [defense counsel]: Unfortunately, your Honor, we are suddenly involved in the merits of the case again andÃ¢ÂÂ
Ã¢ÂÂThe Court: ThatÃ¢ÂÂs true.
Ã¢ÂÂMr. Hale: Ã¢ÂÂwe canÃ¢ÂÂt [truly] discuss the facts before this court without a trial. If Mr. Christianson is satisfied that he in effect has not been injured, I would support that position.
Ã¢ÂÂThe Court: I understand all the complexities. Do the People wish to be heard?
*Supp. 25Ã¢ÂÂMr. Jacinto: Yes, your Honor.
Ã¢ÂÂI would oppose the civil compromise. It seems that a simple compromise in this case would allow the defendant to merely replace what was taken and not suffer what the legislature has determined to be the proper consequences in such a situation.
Ã¢ÂÂI would submit it, your Honor.
Ã¢ÂÂThe Court: The court will grant a civil compromise in counts number I and II under section 1378 of the Penal Code.Ã¢ÂÂ
From our review of the record we note that the victim acknowledged receiving back all the tools that had been stolen from him. Moreover, although he indicated that he had to buy some duplicate tools and lost work due to the fact that his tools had been stolen,6 the victim expressly stated that he was Ã¢ÂÂnot pressing the matter,Ã¢ÂÂ that he agreed to be a witness only upon the request of the police, and that Ã¢ÂÂwhatever the court decides, [he would] go along with it.Ã¢ÂÂ When asked specifically if he objected to the matter being compromised short of conviction, the victim unequivocally stated: Ã¢ÂÂNo.Ã¢ÂÂ
We therefore find that the record contains ample evidence to support the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs implied finding that the victim here Ã¢ÂÂacknowledges that he has received satisfaction for the injury.Ã¢ÂÂ (Pen. Code, ÃÂ§ 1378; People v. Manning (1973) 33 Cal.App.3d 586, 601-602 [109 Cal.Rptr. 531]; cf. John GilmoreÃ¢ÂÂs Case (1817) 2 N.Y. City Hall Recorder 39, cited in People v. Moulton, supra, 131 Cal.App.3d Supp. 10, at Supp. pp. 18-19, 23.)
The thrust of the PeopleÃ¢ÂÂs complaint is that the victim was not Ã¢ÂÂmade wholeÃ¢ÂÂ by the defendant, not that the victim did not receive satisfaction *Supp. 26for the injury.7 The People essentially assert that unless the victim acknowledges that he has received Ã¢ÂÂcompleteÃ¢ÂÂ compensation for the injury the court abuses its discretion in granting a civil compromise. In support the People cite People v. Strub (1975) 49 Cal.App.3d Supp. 1 [122 Cal.Rptr. 374],
We observe that the PeopleÃ¢ÂÂs reliance on Strub is misplaced. Concerning the issue of Ã¢ÂÂsatisfaction,Ã¢ÂÂ the Strub court merely stated: Ã¢ÂÂIt should also be noted that Penal Code section 1378 provides, in part, that a compromise may be permitted in a proper case Ã¢ÂÂif the person injured appears before the court in which the action is pending . . . and acknowledges that he has received satisfaction for the injury . . . .Ã¢ÂÂ Although no cases definitively construe that portion of Penal Code section 1378, there is a tenable argument that the appearance and acknowledgment of satisfaction required by section 1378 constitutes a necessary condition precedent to the courtÃ¢ÂÂs compromise of a misdemeanor charge. While People v. OÃ¢ÂÂRear (1963) 220 Cal.App.2d Supp. 927 [34 Cal.Rptr. 61], may indicate that the injured party need not actually appear before the court, the use of the term Ã¢ÂÂsatisfactionÃ¢ÂÂ would seem to require at least acquiescence to the restitution proffered by defendant.Ã¢ÂÂ {Id., at Supp. p. 4; italics added.)
In Moulton, supra, we announced that Ã¢ÂÂ[b]y requiring personal presence of the victim or in lieu thereof other trustworthy evidence, [section 1378] affords the court the opportunity to assure itself that satisfaction is complete or a settlement voluntary. Instances where the victim has been subject to coercion to dismiss charges are not without precedent.Ã¢ÂÂ (Moulton, supra, 131 Cal.App.3d Supp. 10, at Supp. p. 23.)
What we meant by the phrase Ã¢ÂÂsatisfaction is completeÃ¢ÂÂ is that the victim has in actuality received recompense acceptable to him for his injury,8 not that the victim has received every recovery possible under civil law or everything the victim believed he would be entitled to civilly.
Indeed, nothing in sections 1377 through 1379 nor in the legislative history of the subject civil compromise statute even suggests, much less mandates, *Supp. 27that the victim be made Ã¢ÂÂwholeÃ¢ÂÂ or receive all recovery provided for under civil law as a condition precedent to the approval of a civil compromise by the court.
Moreover, the civil compromise statute does not in fact condition the approval of a compromise on the commencement of a civil action or on the resolution of such action in any particular fashion. The requirement that the victim have Ã¢ÂÂa remedy by a civil actionÃ¢ÂÂ simply serves to define the class of misdemeanor offenses which may be compromised, i.e., those cases which are in reality of a private rather than a public nature. Nor does the statute specify that the victimÃ¢ÂÂs Ã¢ÂÂsatisfaction for the injuryÃ¢ÂÂ must arise from the institution of a civil action or what the nature or form of such Ã¢ÂÂsatisfactionÃ¢ÂÂ be.9 (ÃÂ§ 1378.)
As the Strub court pointed out, such Ã¢ÂÂsatisfactionÃ¢ÂÂ may in fact arise when the victim accepts the restitution proffered by the defendant. The victim, of course, is not required to accept such recompense. If he does not find it to be Ã¢ÂÂsatisfactory,Ã¢ÂÂ then he is entitled to reject it and pursue other avenues to obtain Ã¢ÂÂsatisfaction for his injury.Ã¢ÂÂ
Additionally, we observe that it would serve to defeat, rather than promote, the LegislatureÃ¢ÂÂs purpose in enacting the subject civil compromise statute to construe the requirement that the victim Ã¢ÂÂacknowledges that he has received satisfaction for the injuryÃ¢ÂÂ to mean receipt of everything to which he would be entitled civilly.
The legislative intent behind allowing civil compromise of criminal offenses is not to ensure that the victim is maximally compensated for his injury. Rather, the purpose is to remove from criminal prosecution those offenses for which there is a civil remedy available; the rationale being that the public interest in those cases is best served by requiring the accused to make restitution directly and immediately to the individual victim instead of subjecting him to criminal sanctions for the welfare of society in general.
It is not the function of a criminal court to determine issues of civil liability or damages. (People v. Richards (1976) 17 Cal.3d 614, 620 [131 Cal.Rptr. 537, 552 P.2d 97]; accord, People v. Corners (1985) 176 Cal.App.3d 139, 143-144 [221 Cal.Rptr. 387].) In certain cases a victim *Supp. 28may receive restitution from a defendant through the criminal process. In such a case restitution is imposed as a condition of probation, and it is solely within the province of the court in this context to determine whether restitution is appropriate and the form or amount of such restitution. However, it is established that restitution ordered as a condition of probation is not coextensive with nor a substitute for the recompense that the victim may obtain civilly.10
Similarly, we conclude that it would be inappropriate for a criminal court in a civil compromise matter to determine whether the victim has received the maximum recovery allowable under civil law for his injury.
Instead, the courtÃ¢ÂÂs inquiry focuses on the reason for requiring acknowledgement of satisfaction, which is twofold: (1) to ensure that the victim has in fact received recompense from the defendant, albeit not necessarily the maximum possible therefor; and (2) to ensure that the victimÃ¢ÂÂs settlement with defendant is voluntary. Where the victim voluntarily accepts recompense from the defendant, the court may infer that the victim considered the proffered reparation to be Ã¢ÂÂsatisfactory.Ã¢ÂÂ However, where the recompense is disproportionate to the extent or nature of the injury, the court may infer that the settlement was coerced.
*Supp. 29The order dismissing counts I and II is reversed for the reasons set forth in Part I, ante, arid the matter is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
Bernstein, J., and Reese, J., concurred.

 Although Penal Code section 1378 only empowers the court to Ã¢ÂÂorder all proceedings to be stayed upon the prosecution, and the defendant to be discharged therefrom,Ã¢ÂÂ the legal effect is an order of dismissal as to those counts for which a civil compromise is approved. (See People v. Moulton (1982) 131 Cal.App.3d Supp. 10, 14, 21, 23 [182 Cal.Rptr. 761].) An order of dismissal pursuant to section 1378 is appealable. (Pen. Code, ÃÂ§ÃÂ§ 1466, subd. (a)(1), 1469; see also, People v. Winters (1959) 171 Cal.App.2d Supp. 876, 880 [342 P.2d 538].) Moreover, the order dismissing counts I and II is itself appealable even though count III remained pending at the time. (People v. Davis (1979) 94 Cal.App.3d 215, 220 [156 Cal.Rptr. 395].)


 Entries in a criminal docket are equivalent to entries in the minutes. (Pen. Code, ÃÂ§ 1428; People v. Smith (1955) 133 Cal.App.2d Supp. 777, 779 [284 P.2d 203].)


 At our discretion we could consider defendantÃ¢ÂÂs failure to file a brief to be a concession of error. Instead, we elect to address the appeal on the merits. (People v. Trevisanut (1984) 160 Cal.App.3d Supp. 12, fn. 1 [207 Cal.Rptr. 921].)


 All future references to Ã¢ÂÂcodeÃ¢ÂÂ or Ã¢ÂÂsectionÃ¢ÂÂ are to the Penal Code unless otherwise specified.


 The Legislature, however, withheld such discretion with regard to those offenses committed: Ã¢ÂÂ 1. By or upon an officer of justice, while in the execution of the duties of his office; [H] 2. Riotously; [H] 3. With an intent to commit a felony; [1] 4. In violation of any court order as described in Section 273.6, unless the offense charged is the first such offense committed by the defendant against the family or household member under Section 273.6.Ã¢ÂÂ (ÃÂ§ 1377.) The reason is self-evident: each of these exceptions renders the offense more public than private in nature, and thus, the rationale behind allowing civil compromises no longer exists.


 It is established that Ã¢ÂÂthe civil remedy of damages for conversionÃ¢ÂÂ is the equivalent of the misdemeanor offense of theft, which is Ã¢ÂÂthe unlawful taking of the property of another.Ã¢ÂÂ (People v. OÃ¢ÂÂRear (1963) 220 Cal.App.2d Supp. 927, 931 [34 Cal.Rptr. 61].) Alternative measures of damages for conversion are set forth in Civil Code section 3336. (See also, Civ. Code ÃÂ§ÃÂ§ 3281, 3282, 3380.) Ã¢ÂÂWhere, however, one recovers his property which had been unlawfully taken from him, he is considered to have received it in mitigation of damages, and the measure of damage, in the absence of special damage, is the expense of procuring its return with interest.Ã¢ÂÂ (Beetson v. Hollywood Athletic Club (1930) 109 Cal.App. 715, 722 [293 P. 821]; accord, Blewett v. Miller (1900) 131 Cal. 149, 151 [63 P. 157].) Ã¢ÂÂSpecial damages ... are defined as damages which do not arise from the wrongful act itself, but depend on the circumstances peculiar to the infliction of each respective injury.Ã¢ÂÂ (Myers v. Stephens (1965) 233 Cal.App.2d 104, 120-121 [43 Cal.Rptr. 420].) Loss of profits qualify as recoverable special damages. (Id., at pp. 118, 121.) It is therefore clear that under civil law the victim here could seek recovery of his lost profits but not the value of his tools, since he elected to accept return of the stolen tools (see Englert v. Ivac Corp. (1979) 92 Cal.App.3d 178, 189 [154 Cal.Rptr. 804]).


 The People contend that the victim should be compensated for his lost profits and the cost of the duplicate tools. However, it should be noted that the People do not assert that a civil compromise would not be proper unless the victim recovered his loss-of-use damages, which are recoverable as compensable damages in a conversion action. (Story v. Gateway Chevrolet Co. (1965) 237 Cal.App.2d 705, 709 [47 Cal.Rptr. 267]; accord, Atlas Dev. Co. v. National Surety Co. (1923) 190 Cal. 329, 332 [212 P. 196]; see also, Meyers v. Bradford (1921) 54 Cal.App. 157, 160-161 [201 P. 471]; Beetson, supra, 109 Cal.App. at pp. 723-724.) Nor do they refer to an award of punitive damages, which are likewise recoverable in such an action. (Civ. Code, ÃÂ§ 3294, subd. (a); see generally, 14 Cal.Jur.3d, Conversion, ÃÂ§ 48, pp. 836-838.)


 Parenthetically, we observe that the Legislature reserved to the trial court discretion to disapprove a civil compromise even if the court determines that the victim has in fact received satisfaction for his injury.


 Obviously, not every civil dispute is resolved by the commencement of an action or results in a judgment in favor of the plaintiff following a trial on the merits. It is frequently the situation that the matter is settled out of court or prior to trial between the parties who compromise their respective positions to the mutual satisfaction of each. Moreover, it is sometimes the case that the plaintiff may originally seek to recover a specific item yet agree to accept money or other goods as substitution therefor.


 A court may impose restitution as a condition of probation upon a defendantÃ¢ÂÂs conviction, albeit only where the restitution ordered arises from the criminal offense for which defendant was convicted. People v. Corners (1985) 176 Cal.App.3d 139, 142-143, 147-149. Ã¢ÂÂBut courts must tread lightly in this area lest they be reduced to Ã¢ÂÂmere collection agenciesÃ¢ÂÂ [citations]. . . .Ã¢ÂÂ (People v. Richards (1976) 17 Cal.3d 614, 620 [131 Cal.Rptr. 537, 552 P.2d 97].) Ã¢ÂÂRestitution imposed in a proper case and in an appropriate manner may serve the salutary purpose of making a criminal understand that he has harmed not merely society in the abstract but also individual human beings, and that he has a responsibility to make them whole.Ã¢ÂÂ (Richards, supra, at p. 620.)
Ã¢ÂÂHowever, Ã¢ÂÂ[disposing of civil liability cannot be a function of restitution in a criminal case. To begin with, the criminal justice system is essentially incapable of determining that a defendant is in fact civilly liable, and if so, to what extent. A judge may infer from a jury verdict of guilt in a theft case that a defendant is liable to the crime victim. But a trial court cannot properly conclude that the defendant owes money to a third party for other unproved or disproved crimes or conduct. A party sued civilly has important due process rights, including appropriate pleadings, discovery, and a right to a trial by jury on the specific issues of liability and damages. The judge in the criminal trial should not be permitted to emasculate those rights by simply declaring his belief that the defendant owes a sum of money.Ã¢ÂÂ (Ibid.) [1i] No matter how compelling the evidence of civil liability may be, the jury in a criminal case makes no finding of such liability. At the criminal trial, defendant need only raise a reasonable doubt regarding the elements of the crime charged. No duty is placed upon him, nor could it be, to prove that he is not civilly liable. Any legal conclusion in a criminal trial that he is so liable contravenes defendantÃ¢ÂÂs due process rights. (Id., at p. 621.) [U] Ã¢ÂÂThus, Ã¢ÂÂRestitution or reparation is not a substitute for a civil action to recover damagesÃ¢ÂÂ [citation], and a defendantÃ¢ÂÂs duty of restitution cannot be predicated merely on a purported debt.Ã¢ÂÂ (Ibid.)"" (Corners, supra, 176 Cal.App.3d at pp. 143-144, quoting from and citing to Richards.)

Opinion
SOVEN, J.
Defendant appeals from a judgment of conviction for violation of Penal Code section 12025, subdivision (a) (carrying concealed in a vehicle a concealable firearm). His sole contention on appeal is that the pistol seized from his vehicle was inoperable and therefore did not come within the class of firearms prohibited by section 12025, subdivision (a). We agree and reverse.
At trial, the defense produced expert testimony that the antique pistol found in defendantÃ¢ÂÂs vehicle was inoperable because it lacked a barrel and firing pin mechanism.1 It was also established that the pistol could not readily be restored to an operable condition. The court made the factual determination that the pistol was incomplete, in poor repair and inoperable.
Defendant acknowledges that many California cases hold that the operability of a firearm is not an element for certain sections of the Dangerous WeaponsÃ¢ÂÂ Control Law (Pen. Code, ÃÂ§ 12000 et seq.),2 but urges that those opinions do not apply to section 12025, subdivision (a). We agree.
In People v. Jackson (1968) 266 Cal.App.2d 341, 347 [72 Cal.Rptr. 162], the court held that section 12021 (possession of a concealable firearm by an ex-felon) prohibited only the carrying of an operable weapon. The Legislature then amended section 12001, subdivision (b), to provide that as Ã¢ÂÂused in Sections 12021, 12072, and 12073, the terms Ã¢ÂÂpistol,Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂrevolver,Ã¢ÂÂ and Ã¢ÂÂfirearm capable of being concealed upon the personÃ¢ÂÂ include the frame or receiver of any such weapon.Ã¢ÂÂ The amendment thus negated the requirement in Jackson of operability. (People v. Thompson (1977) 72 Cal.App.3d 1, 4 [139 Cal.Rptr. 800].)
*Supp. 3Sections 12021, 12072 and 12073 relate to the possession of a concealable weapon by certain classes of persons. By referring to those sections in amending section 12001 the Legislature made clear that an ex-felon or narcotics addict could not, under any circumstances, possess an operable or inoperable pistol, revolver or other concealable firearm. (ÃÂ§ 12021.) To further control possession by certain classes of persons, the Legislature made clear that no person or business could sell or transfer such a weapon or the frame or receiver of such a weapon to any persons in the prohibited classes. (ÃÂ§ 12072.)3 Thus, the Legislature in amending section 12001 was concerned with possession by persons who should not possess concealable firearms.
In contrast, section 12025 chiefly regulates the possession in public or in a vehicle, of unloaded concealable firearms by persons permitted to possess such weapons.4
People v. Nelums (1982) 31 Cal.3d 355 [182 Cal.Rptr. 515, 644 P.2d 201], relied on by the People, which held that operability was not limited to violations of sections 12021, 12073 and 12074, impliedly recognized that the Legislature was concerned with persons who ought not to have firearms. Nelums involved sections 12022, subdivision (a), and 12022.5. These sections do not relate to the possession of weapons otherwise lawfully possessed. Rather, section 12022, subdivision (a), provides an enhanced punishment for a person who is armed with a firearm while committing a felony, and section 12022.5 provides an enhanced punishment for a person who personally uses a firearm while committing a felony. Given the purpose of those sections, the Supreme Court in People v. Nelums, supra, 31 Cal.3d 355, held that a person is Ã¢ÂÂarmed with a firearmÃ¢ÂÂ within the meaning of Penal Code section 12022, subdivision (a), even if the weapon is inoperable (31 Cal.3d at p. 360), and approved those cases holding that a person Ã¢ÂÂuses a firearmÃ¢ÂÂ within the meaning of section 12022.5 whether or not the weapon is operable. (Id.., at p. 359.)
The court reasoned: Ã¢ÂÂ[Substantial risks of harm by a resisting victim or third person exist whether or not the offenderÃ¢ÂÂs firearm is operable. Although such risks may be minimal if the firearm remains concealed, armed offenders frequently may passively display their firearms, without actually using them to facilitate the commission of their offenses. Such passive display may *Supp. 4stimulate resistance. Moreover, the Legislature reasonably could have sought to discourage persons from arming themselves with an inoperable firearm, whether or not concealed, because of the potential for harm in the event that the firearm is ultimately displayed and used. It follows that even though defendant may not have actually used his firearm, his mere act of carrying it created the additional risks of harm which fully justify an enhanced penalty.Ã¢ÂÂ (31 Cal.3d at pp. 359-360.)
We note that under Penal Code section 12025, firearms Ã¢ÂÂcarried openly in belt holsters are not concealed . . . .Ã¢ÂÂ Thus part of the theory underlying Nelums does not apply to the lawful transportation of a concealable firearm. (Ã¢ÂÂ. . . armed offenders . . . may passively display their firearms . . . .Ã¢ÂÂ (31 Cal.3d at p. 360.))
In short, we conclude that the Legislature did not intend to include inoperable weapons within the meaning of a concealable weapon the public possession and transportation of which is regulated by section 12025.5
The judgment is reversed.
Cooperman, P. J., and Bernstein, 1, concurred.

The expert, although testifying that the Ã¢ÂÂbarrelÃ¢ÂÂ was Ã¢ÂÂmissing,Ã¢ÂÂ also testified that there was Ã¢ÂÂtoolingÃ¢ÂÂ on the Ã¢ÂÂbreachÃ¢ÂÂ to which a Ã¢ÂÂbarrelÃ¢ÂÂ would be affixed. We have examined the weapon; the Ã¢ÂÂtoolingÃ¢ÂÂ looks like a very short Ã¢ÂÂbarrel.Ã¢ÂÂ


All references are to the Penal Code.


Section 12073 requires a dealer to keep a register qf transactions involving pistols, revolvers, or other concealable weapons.


Section 12026 authorizes persons not within the prohibited classes to possess concealable firearms in their homes or businesses. Section 12031 prohibits possession in a public place or vehicle of any loaded firearm, whether or not concealable. Although section 12025 is violated when anyone, including a felon, possesses a concealable firearm, that section is necessary only to control the acts of a person otherwise permitted to possess the weapon.


We emphasize that this opinion is limited to the possession of an unloaded inoperable concealable firearm. (Cf. People v. Hale (1974) 43 Cal.App.3d 353, 356 [117 Cal.Rptr. 697] [dictum re disassembled concealable firearm]; People v. Taylor (1984) 151 Cal.App.3d 432, 436-437 [199 Cal.Rptr. 6] [dictum re operability of loaded firearm].)

Opinion
BONNEY, J.
The issue presented on this appeal is whether the police officer involved had reasonable cause to detain defendant and investigate *Supp. 7to determine whether defendant was in violation of section 23152, subdivision (a) of the Vehicle Code.
We conclude that reasonable cause did exist and that the ensuing arrest was proper and, therefore, affirm the judgment.
The facts are not in dispute. Police Officer James Buchanan of the Santa Clara Police Department testified at the hearing on the motion that on February 8,1985, he was on patrol in the area of Stevens Creek and Saratoga and Ã¢ÂÂ[a]s I had been driving southbound on Saratoga approaching Stevens Creek, I was hailed by a motorist in the lane beside me. He informed me that the car behind him was being driven by what he believed to be a drunk, quote, unquote. I looked behind him and saw Mr. WillardÃ¢ÂÂs car. Upon looking back at the witness, I saw that he was pointing directly at Mr. WillardÃ¢ÂÂs car. The witness then drove off, and I pulled in behind Mr. WillardÃ¢ÂÂs car and made a traffic stop.Ã¢ÂÂ
He testified that he stopped defendant solely on the basis of what the motorist told him, that he allowed defendantÃ¢ÂÂs car to pass him, pulled in behind defendant, followed him through the intersection of Stevens Creek and Saratoga, then put on his lights and Ã¢ÂÂpulled him over,Ã¢ÂÂ and that his Ã¢ÂÂmain concern was if he made another block, he would be very near a freeway on-ramp.Ã¢ÂÂ
It is implicit that the officer noticed no erratic driving which formed the basis for the stop. Defendant stopped his vehicle partially in a restaurant driveway, but this fact had no bearing on the officerÃ¢ÂÂs decision to stop defendant, which had already been made.
The officer noted defendant had glassy eyes and the odor of alcohol. He administered field sobriety tests, then placed defendant under arrest for the subject violation.
The officer did not know the motorist who described defendant as a drunk, and the motoristÃ¢ÂÂs identity was not learned, it appears, until after the stop was made.
DefendantÃ¢ÂÂs contentions on this appeal are: 1) the motorist was an anonymous informer and, therefore, not presumptively reliable, and 2) that in any event, the statement of the motorist that the car behind him was being driven by what he thought to be a Ã¢ÂÂdrunkÃ¢ÂÂ was a mere conclusion and did not contain specific and articulable facts upon which the officer could base a rational conclusion that some activity relating to crime was occurring and that defendant was involved in that activity in accordance with the require*Supp. 8ments for detention specified in In re Tony C. (1978) 21 Cal.3d 888 [148 Cal.Rptr. 366, 582 P.2d 957],
1. Was the Motorist a Reliable Citizen Witness?
We conclude that the motorist here was clothed with all the indicia of a reliable citizen witness to crime and that the officer could reasonably rely on what the motorist told him, and further, that in the circumstances here, the fact that the officer did not get the motoristÃ¢ÂÂs name and address before detaining defendant did not affect the motoristÃ¢ÂÂs reliability. We do not regard the language in People v. Ramey (1976) 16 Cal.3d 263 [127 Cal.Rptr. 629, 545 P.2d 1333], a case involving probable cause to arrest, that police must Ã¢ÂÂbe aware of the identity of the person providing the information and of his status as a true citizen informantÃ¢ÂÂ as mandating in all cases of detention the furnishing of a name and address or other identifying information to the police if the circumstances otherwise indicate to the officer that the informer is a reliable witness to a crime in progress and is acting in aid of law enforcement. (See People v. Superior Court (Meyer) (1981) 118 Cal.App.3d 579 [173 Cal.Rptr. 544].) The exigency of the situation was apparent. Both the motorist and the officer were in moving traffic, the freeway entrance was a short distance away, and defendant would have been long gone if the officer had detained the motorist to obtain a name and address and enough information to satisfy himself that the motorist was reliable. In addition, there is no evidence that there was anything about the motorist to suggest that he was acting from ulterior motive, and he acted openly, exposing himself to identification. Furthermore, as a motorist on the highway, he, himself, was exposed to the hazard of a drunk driver immediately behind him in his lane of traffic. We conclude from all the facts and circumstances that the motorist was a reliable citizen witness and that the officer could rely on the information he received.
2. Did the Officer Obtain Sufficient Information From the Motorist to Justify the Detention?
We conclude that he did, and that the facts here satisfy the requirements of In re Tony C., supra.
The specific and articulable facts which led the officer here to suspect that criminal activity was taking place and that defendant was involved in that activity were: (1) the reliable statement of the motorist that defendantÃ¢ÂÂs car was being driven by a Ã¢ÂÂdrunk,Ã¢ÂÂ and (2) the officerÃ¢ÂÂs own concurrent observations of the defendant in the act of driving a vehicle on a public highway.
*Supp. 9Defendant argues that the statement of the motorist to the officer that defendantÃ¢ÂÂs car was being driven by a Ã¢ÂÂdrunkÃ¢ÂÂ was a mere conclusion and there were no factual statements underlying that conclusion made to the officer on the basis of which the officer himself could have formed an opinion one way or the other as to whether there was cause to believe defendant was indeed drunk. Appellant argues in effect that had the motorist told the officer that he had seen the defendant weaving, or speeding, or running a red light, or that he had spoken to defendant and that his speech was slurred or his eyes glassy, or he smelled of alcohol, that would have been sufficient to justify the detention, but that the absence of these magic recitations of fact in the exigencies of moving traffic renders the detention illegal.
The information of a reliable citizen witness may be taken as true or at Ã¢ÂÂface valueÃ¢ÂÂ (People v. Baker (1970) 12 Cal.App.3d 826 [96 Cal.Rptr. 760]), and we believe the statement that defendantÃ¢ÂÂs vehicle was being driven by what the motorist believed was a Ã¢ÂÂdrunkÃ¢ÂÂ is, and would be commonly understood to be, a statement of a fact observed by the motorist. The objective signs of intoxication are matters of common knowledge and experience. Implicit in the motoristÃ¢ÂÂs statement is that he had observed defendant and believed him to be drunk. We find no other common sense explanation for his statement.
Furthermore, it is well established in California that a police officer may detain and question a citizen under circumstances short of probable cause to arrest: Ã¢ÂÂThe accepted guideline for temporary stopping for questioning is whether a reasonable man in the same circumstances would believe such conduct necessary to a proper discharge of duties. [Citation.] The strength of the information an officer should have to engage in questioning is necessarily much less than it would be for an arrest. [Citation.] The Supreme Court Ã¢ÂÂstop and friskÃ¢ÂÂ cases, as summarized in Terry v. Ohio . . . have not abolished the California rule permitting a temporary detention for questioning where the officer can point to reasons beyond a mere hunch, for questioning the suspects. Ã¢ÂÂ (People v. Stephenson (1969) 268 Cal.App.2d 908, 910-911 [74 Cal.Rptr. 504]. See also In re Tony C., supra, 21 Cal.3d 888; People v. Flores (1974) 12 Cal.3d 85 [115 Cal.Rptr. 225, 524 P.2d 353]; Green v. Dept. of Motor Vehicles (1977) 68 Cal.App.3d 536 [137 Cal.Rptr. 368]; People v. Gibson (1963) 220 Cal.App.2d 15 [33 Cal.Rptr. 775]; Williams v. Superior Court (1969) 274 Cal.App.2d 709 [79 Cal.Rptr. 489]; People v. Martinez (1970) 6 Cal.App.3d 373 [86 Cal.Rptr. 49]; People v. Superior Court (Meyer), supra, 118 Cal.App.3d 579.)
Here, defendant relies on the language in People v. Ramey, supra, to the effect that the rule regarding the reliability of a citizen witness Ã¢ÂÂ. . . does not, of course, dispense with the requirement that the informantÃ¢ÂÂwhether *Supp. 10citizen or otherwiseÃ¢ÂÂfurnish underlying facts sufficiently detailed to cause a reasonable person to believe that a crime had been committed and the named suspect was the perpetrator . . . .Ã¢ÂÂ (16 Cal.3d at p. 269.)
Defendant overlooks the fact that the court in Ramey was speaking specifically to the issue of probable cause to arrest, not detain, which, of course, requires sufficient information to lead a reasonable person to believe: (1) that a crime has been committed, and (2) that defendant is guilty thereof, and the court in Ramey found probable cause to arrest solely on the information furnished by an informant.
The court in In re Tony C., supra, 21 Cal.3d 888, however, was careful to ground probable cause to detain on an entirely different footing, and the pertinent language of that case bears rereading. In that case, two juveniles on the public street were detained during the noon hour when school was not in session. They were engaged in no unusual activity, and no recent crimes had been reported in the vicinity which could possibly implicate the two minor defendants. The stop was based on mere hunch.
The court points out that reasonable cause to believe that a crime has in fact been committed and defendant is guilty thereof is not required in detention, and that indeed a person properly detained may be guilty of no offense, and a salient holding of In re Tony C., supra, 21 Cal.3d 888, is that the suspect activity may be consistent with innocent as well as criminal conduct, and the purpose of detention is to resolve that ambiguity: Ã¢ÂÂIt is settled that circumstances short of probable cause to make an arrest may justify a police officer stopping and briefly detaining a person for questioning or other limited investigation.Ã¢ÂÂ (At p. 892.) Ã¢ÂÂ[I]n order to justify an investigative stop or detention the circumstances known or apparent to the officer must include specific and articulable facts causing him to suspect that (1) some activity relating to crime has taken place or is occurring or about to occur, and (2) the person he intends to stop or detain is involved in that activity. . . . The corollary to this rule, of course, is that an investigative stop or detention predicated on mere curiosity, rumor, or hunch is unlawful. . . .Ã¢ÂÂ (At p. 893.) Ã¢ÂÂThe possibility of an innocent explanation does not deprive the officer of the capacity to entertain a reasonable suspicion of criminal conduct. Indeed, the principal function of his investigation is to resolve that very ambiguity and establish whether the activity is in fact legal or illegalÃ¢ÂÂto Ã¢ÂÂenable the police to quickly determine whether they should allow the suspect to go about his business or hold him to answer charges.Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ (At p. 894.)
In this case, the officer had reliable information on which he could base a rational suspicion: (1) that criminal activity was in progress (the *Supp. 11report of the motorist that he believed defendant to be drunk), and (2) that defendant was connected with that activity (the officerÃ¢ÂÂs own contemporaneous observations of defendant in the act of driving a vehicle on a public highway). We conclude these facts meet the criteria of In re Tony C., supra, for detention and investigation.
The judgment of conviction is affirmed.

SOVEN, J.
Plaintiff Marianne Berman appeals from a judgment in an unlawful detainer action in favor of defendant tenants Carolyn Downing and Patrick Tracy. We affirm.
Facts
Plaintiff owns a building located in West Hollywood. On November 28, 1984, plaintiff and defendants entered into a one-year written lease for an apartment in plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs building, the tenancy to commence on November 28, 1984, at a monthly rental of $700. On November 29, the City of West Hollywood enacted an ordinance establishing a moratorium regulating rents and evictions. The ordinance by its terms expired May 1,1985, and provided, as relevant, for a rent rollback which limited landlords, starting November 29, to the rent in effect on August 6, 1984.
The West Hollywood City Council found that there existed a Ã¢ÂÂcritical shortage of rental housingÃ¢ÂÂ in West Hollywood, that before the formation of the City of West Hollywood, rents for some but not all housing within the City were controlled by a Los Angeles County ordinance which would soon expire, that a comprehensive rent regulation ordinance was needed for the city and that Ã¢ÂÂif a temporary moratorium is not now imposed, substantial rent increases are likely to occur,Ã¢ÂÂ which would defeat the intent and purpose of the proposed ordinance. The moratorium ordinance was declared to be necessary to Ã¢ÂÂprotect the public peace, health, safety and welfare . . . .Ã¢ÂÂ
Before the enactment of the West Hollywood ordinance, a Los Angeles County ordinance, first enacted in 1979, governed rental housing in West Hollywood.
Discussion
Plaintiff contends that the West Hollywood ordinance is unconstitutional in that the rent rollback provisions impair contractual obligations in violation of the United States and California Constitutions, and are an arbitrary and unreasonable exercise of the police power. PlaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs contentions are without merit on this record.
*Supp. 4We hold, on this record consisting of a stipulation of facts and the language of the West Hollywood Moratorium Ordinance,1 that the rent rollback provisions of that ordinance are constitutional.
We agree with plaintiff that Ã¢ÂÂthe constitutionality of residential rent controls under the police power depends upon the actual existence of a housing shortage and its concomitant ill effects of sufficient seriousness to make rent control a rational curative measure.Ã¢ÂÂ (Birkenfeld. v. City of Berkeley (1976) 17 Cal.3d 129, 160 [130 Cal.Rptr. 465, 550 P.2d 1001].) Equally important, however, Ã¢ÂÂthe existence of Ã¢ÂÂconstitutional factsÃ¢ÂÂ upon which the validity of an enactment depends [citation] is presumed in the absence of any showing to the contrary [citation] . . . .Ã¢ÂÂ (Ibid.) Plaintiff was entitled to show the nonexistence of those facts as to the West Hollywood ordinance but failed to do so.
At oral argument, plaintiff relied on the Ã¢ÂÂconstitutional factsÃ¢ÂÂ supporting the validity of the county rent control ordinance, and argued that because the county ordinance was presumed constitutional, the West Hollywood ordinance, based on different Ã¢ÂÂconstitutional facts,Ã¢ÂÂ was necessarily unconstitutional. The county ordinance is not, however, before us. Besides, the theory that there is only one correct legislative solution to a problem defies common sense and law. (E.g., Williamson v. Lee Optical Co. (1955) 348 U.S. 483, 488 [99 L.Ed. 563, 572, 75 S.Ct. 79].)
The true thrust of plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs contention appears to be that the rollback provisions of the West Hollywood moratorium ordinance are facially void. We disagree.
In Birkenfeld v. City of Berkeley, supra, 17 Cal.3d 129, 159-160, our Supreme Court held that municipal rent control legislation is generally a proper exercise of the police power. Whether a specific rent control ordinance reflects a proper exercise of the police power depends, as noted, upon whether a housing shortage is sufficiently serious to make rent control a rational curative measure. (Birkenfeld v. City of Berkeley, supra, 17 Cal.3d 129, 160.) The West Hollywood City Council declared that a Ã¢ÂÂcritical shortage of rental housingÃ¢ÂÂ existed in West Hollywood. We are required to rely on that declaration.
*Supp. 5PlaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs contention that the rent rollback2 provisions of the ordinance violate the contract clause is without merit. No case has held or suggested that rent rollback provisions are per se unconstitutional. Birkenfeld noted that the Ã¢ÂÂmere fact that a city rent control measure would nullify tenantsÃ¢ÂÂ liabilities to landlords for rent in excess of stated ceiling does not render the measure invalidÃ¢ÂÂ (17 Cal.3d at p. 143), and that rent control enactments Ã¢ÂÂtypically use the rent charged on a prior date as a starting point for the fixing of maximum rents. ...Ã¢ÂÂ (Id., at p. 166.) Thus, Birkenfeld recognized as inevitable that some contractual obligations would be affected. Moreover, rent rollbacks have been held constitutional in other jurisdictions. (Windman v. City of Englewood (N.J.Super. 1985) 491 A.2d 32, 37; Chelmsford Trailer Park v. Town of Chelmsford (Mass. 1984) 469 N.E.2d 1259, 1266; Twentieth Century Associates v. Waldman (N.Y. 1945) 63 N.E.2d 177, 179.)
Plaintiff, conceding that legislative bodies are entitled to restrict contractual rights without violating constitutional provisions against the impairment of contractual obligations (e.g., Home Building & Loan Asso. v. Blaisdell (1933) 290 U.S. 398, 447-448 [78 L.Ed. 413, 434, 54 S.Ct. 231, 88 A.L.R. 1481]) nonetheless asserts that the legislative body must demonstrate exigent circumstances to justify an impairment of contract obligations. Plaintiff overstates the requirements.3
The contract clause merely imposes Ã¢ÂÂlimits upon the power of a State to abridge existing contractual relationships, even in the exercise of its otherwise legitimate police power.Ã¢ÂÂ (Allied Structural Steel Co. v. Spannaus (1978) 438 U.S. 234, 242 [57 L.Ed.2d 727, 734, 98 S.Ct. 2716].) The prohibitions of the contract clause Ã¢ÂÂmust be accommodated to the inherent power of the State Ã¢ÂÂto safeguard the vital interests of its people.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ (Energy Reserves Group v. Kansas Power & Light, supra, 459 U.S. 400, 410 [74 L.Ed.2d 569, 580].)
Moreover, a threshold inquiry is whether the legislative enactment has in fact operated as a substantial impairment of a contractual relationship. *Supp. 6Ã¢ÂÂMinimal alteration of contractual obligations may end the inquiry at its first stage.Ã¢ÂÂ (Allied Structural Steel Co. v. Spannaus, supra, 438 U.S. at pp. 244-245 [57 L.Ed.2d at pp. 736-737].) In determining the extent of impairment, a court must Ã¢ÂÂconsider whether the industry the complaining party has entered has been regulated in the past.Ã¢ÂÂ (Energy Reserves Group v. Kansas Power & Light, supra, 459 U.S. at p. 411 [74 L.Ed.2d at p. 580].)
Here, the city council declared a critical shortage of rental housing, the purpose of the moratorium ordinance was to permit the enactment of meaningful permanent legislation, the ordinance was of six monthsÃ¢ÂÂ duration only, rents were fixed at a time less than four months preceding the date of the enactment, rent control benefited all renters within the community, and the business of rental housing had been government controlled for at least five years. No significant impairment of contractual rights appears on this record.
The judgment is affirmed. Respondents to recover costs on appeal.
Cooperman, P. J., and Reese, J., concurred.

Plaintiff asserts, for example, that the Los Angeles County Rent Control Ordinance had controlled any existing crisis and that Ã¢ÂÂbecause the housing crisis in the West Hollywood area was already under control at the time the City became incorporated, the type emergency that qualifies to invoke police power did not exist. . . .Ã¢ÂÂ Without deciding whether plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs legal theory is correct, we have no facts to indicate the condition of the rental housing market before and during rent control under the county ordinance.


Ã¢ÂÂRollbackÃ¢ÂÂ is a phrase of convenience and possibly deceptive. To roll back rents means that future rents are based on rents in existence on a prior date; rents paid are unaffected.


In early cases, whether an enactment violated the contract clause depended on five factors: that the legislative body had declared the existence of an emergency; that the law was enacted to protect a legitimate public interest; that the relief was appropriately tailored to meet the emergency it was designed to meet; that conditions imposed were reasonable; and that the legislation was limited to the duration of the emergency. (Home Building & Loan Asso. v. Blaisdell, supra, 290 U.S. 398, 434 [78 L.Ed. 413, 426].) However, the United States Supreme Court has concluded that the public purpose need not be Ã¢ÂÂaddressed to an emergency or temporary situation.Ã¢ÂÂ (Energy Reserves Group v. Kansas Power & Light (1983) 459 U.S. 400, 412 [74 L.Ed.2d 569, 581, 103 S.Ct. 697].)

Opinion
STEELE, P. J.
Misdemeanor complaints were filed in the municipal court respectively naming, as defendants, Dick Otto Weisse, case number MM68376, Sharyl Ann Weisse, case number MM68377, and Deborah K. Lionberger, case number MM68378, following the arrests of each on May 31,1985, for violation of Health and Safety Code section 11550, subdivision (a) (illegal use of controlled substance). The defendants were arraigned and entered pleas of not guilty on June 28, 1985. On August 2, 1985, a motion was heard to suppress evidence pursuant to Penal Code section 1538.5. The defendants jointly challenged the constitutional propriety under the Fourth Amendment standards of their detention and subsequent arrest by the sheriffÃ¢ÂÂs deputy who stopped the automobile driven by the defendant, Dick Weisse, in which the defendants, Sharyl Weisse and Deborah Lionberger, *Supp. 3were passengers, and made observations upon which the instant prosecution is based. At the conclusion of the hearing, and following the taking of evidence and argument, the trial court granted the suppression motion as to the defendant, Dick Weisse, and denied the motions as to the defendants, Sharyl Weisse and Deborah Lionberger, principally because they lacked standing to assert a similar constitutional basis for the motion. Thereafter, upon appropriate application by these appellants, this court stayed further proceedings in the lower court pending final determination of this appeal.
The issue presented is the standing of a vehicleÃ¢ÂÂs passengers to seek suppression on Fourth Amendment grounds of police observations and other evidence obtained as the result of an unlawful seizure. More precisely, the question is: In light of the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs finding that the stopping of the vehicle driven by Dick Weisse Ã¢ÂÂwas not supported by probable cause,Ã¢ÂÂ did the court erroneously deny the suppression motion of appellants Sharyl Ann Weisse and Deborah Lionberger because they Ã¢ÂÂlacked standing to assert the violation of the driverÃ¢ÂÂs Fourth Amendment rightsÃ¢ÂÂ under Rakas v. Illinois (1978) 439 U.S. 128 [58 L.Ed.2d 387, 99 S.Ct. 421]?
The question must be answered in the affirmative. We conclude that the trial court erred in its application of Rakas.
At 1:15 on the morning of May 31, 1985, the arresting officer was on traffic patrol in the City of Camarillo when he observed the three defendants enter a car parked in the Paseo Camarillo Shopping Center. He did not see where the defendants had come from, but assumed that it was from JosephinaÃ¢ÂÂs, one of two restaurants in the vicinity with bars. The automobile was then driven by Mr. Weisse to the exit of the parking lot where it stopped at a stop sign for 15 or 20 seconds and then made a left turn onto Lantana Avenue without signaling. Although the officer admitted that the stop was proper, he found the 15- to 20-second pause suspicious. Other than that, and the failure to signal before turning, he observed nothing unusual.
The officer then followed the vehicle for at least three quarters of a mile before stopping it. The basis for the stop was a combination of the vehicleÃ¢ÂÂs failure to signal when leaving the parking lot, the Ã¢ÂÂunusually long stop,Ã¢ÂÂ the lateness of the hour, the fact that there were two bars in the vicinity, and that the driver could Ã¢ÂÂpossiblyÃ¢ÂÂ be drunk. It should be noted that during the time in which the officer followed the vehicle, it did nothing further to arouse the officerÃ¢ÂÂs suspicious.
Upon being stopped, the driver exited the vehicle and produced his driverÃ¢ÂÂs license. The officer smelled alcohol and shined the light in the driverÃ¢ÂÂs eyes. *Supp. 4The driver acknowledged that he had been drinking. There is some confusion as to whether a field sobriety test was given. The officer then directed the driver to step onto the sidewalk and went to investigate the vehicle, alleging fear for his safety.
Mrs. Weisse was in the front passenger seat and Mrs. Lionberger was in the rear. The officer shined his flashlight around the car in search of weapons and alcohol and found neither. He then decided to look into the eyes of the passengers. He tried, but was unsuccessful. He was, however, determined to do so. As he stated regarding Mrs. Lionberger, Ã¢ÂÂIf she would have never looked, I probably would have went on and tried later. I would have looked there all night trying to look at her face.Ã¢ÂÂ He went on to say that if they tried to walk away, he would have followed them Ã¢ÂÂnot to stop them, just walk up to them and look in their face.Ã¢ÂÂ The officer finally determined that the passengers each had dilated pupils and the arrest followed.
The appellants contend 4hat the trial court erred in concluding that the appellants lacked standing to challenge the unlawful stop of the automobile in which they were passengers, because they had a legitimate expectation of privacy, under the Fourth Amendment, to travel free of any unreasonable government intrusion. The trial court relied on Rakas v. Illinois, supra, 439 U.S. 128, for its finding that the appellants had no standing to assert the motion to suppress. We find, however, that Rakas does not stand for that. Rakas, rather, sets forth the principle that Fourth Amendment rights are personal rights that may not be asserted vicariously. Justice Rehnquist noted, Ã¢ÂÂFor we are. not at all sure that the determination of a motion to suppress is materially aided by labeling the inquiry identified in Jones as one of standing, rather than simply recognizing it as one involving the substantive question of whether or not the proponent of the motion to suppress has had his own Fourth Amendment rights infringed by the search and seizure which he seeks to challenge.Ã¢ÂÂ (Id., at p. 133, italics added.) One year later, in United States v. Salvucci (1980) 448 U.S. 83 [65 L.Ed.2d 619, 100 S.Ct. 2547], Justice Rehnquist, again writing for the court, in footnote 4 at page 87 [65 L.Ed.2d at page 625] said, Ã¢ÂÂIn Rakas, this Court discarded reliance on concepts of Ã¢ÂÂstandingÃ¢ÂÂ in determining whether a defendant is entitled to claim the protections of the exclusionary rule. The inquiry, after Rakas, is simply whether the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs rights were violated by t% allegedly illegal search or seizure.Ã¢ÂÂ
We must then decide whether these appellantsÃ¢ÂÂ Fourth Amendment rights have been violated. No California authority has been provided to us. There have been, however, several cases from other jurisdictions.
*Supp. 5In People v. Kunath (1981) 99 III.App.3d 201 [425 N.E. 2d 486], the Appellate Court of Illinois said on page 489, Ã¢ÂÂRegardless of whether defendant had a legitimate expectation of privacy in the contents of the automobile so as to challenge successfully the search thereof, as a passenger he can challenge the stopping of the vehicle since his personal liberty and freedom were intruded upon by that act. [Citations] The Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution forbid unreasonable searches and seizures, and it is clear that stopping an automobile and detaining its occupants constitutes a Ã¢ÂÂseizureÃ¢ÂÂ of those persons [Citations]. And, for the evidence seized as a result of that stop to be admissible, the stop must not have been unreasonable.Ã¢ÂÂ (Italics in original.) The Supreme Court of Rhode Island in State v. DeMasi (R.I. 1980) 419 A.2d 285, wrote on page 294, Ã¢ÂÂOn the facts before us, we believe that although the investigatory stop may have focused primarily on Lanoue as the operator of the vehicle, the officers effectively inhibited the free movement of all three individuals in the car to an equivalent extent. Furthermore, at the time Officer Zwolenski requested the documents from Lanoue, he also asked for identification from the two passengers. And the fact that the officers took the names of all three for the NCIC warrant check can leave but little doubt that each was being personally detained. We conclude that while traveling in the Mercury, all three shared a legitimate expectation that they would be free from the unreasonable governmental intrusion occasioned by the stop, the request for identification, and the warrant check. To hold otherwise here would be to draw artificial formalistic distinctions not grounded in logic.Ã¢ÂÂ The courts suppressed the evidence. The Supreme Court of Iowa, in State v. Eis (Iowa 1984) 348 N.W. 2d 224, observed, Ã¢ÂÂNo principled basis exists for distinguishing between the privacy rights of passengers and drivers in a moving vehicle. When the vehicle is stopped they are equally seized; their freedom of movement is equally affected. We therefore hold that occupants of motor vehicles, whether drivers or passengers, ordinarily have a legitimate expectation of privacy which is invaded when the vehicle is stopped by the government. ... [f] The majority of the courts which have considered the issue have upheld the standing of a passenger to challenge a vehicle stop [Citations].Ã¢ÂÂ (Id., at p. 226.) We find the above cases well reasoned and persuasive.
We now turn to the second question raised by appellants. Was the officerÃ¢ÂÂs conduct, as relates to these appealing parties, a Ã¢ÂÂcontactÃ¢ÂÂ or a detention? It seems clear to us, in the light of People v. Spicer (1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 213 [203 Cal.Rptr. 599] and People v. Bailey (1985) 176 Cal.App.3d 402 [222 Cal.Rptr. 235], that there was a detention.
As in Spicer, we have passengers in a vehicle stopped in the early morning hours by a police officer demanding to see their eyes. The language from *Supp. 6Spicer would be identical to the case at bar. On pages 218-219, the court said, Ã¢ÂÂIn the case at bench, Ms. Spicer was contacted as she sat in the passenger seat of an automobile in a residential neighborhood at 1:30 in the morning. Her freedom of movement was practically nil .... To say under these circumstances Ms. Spicer Ã¢ÂÂremain[ed] free to disregard the [officerÃ¢ÂÂs] questions and walk awayÃ¢ÂÂ (citation) would be to defy what common sense tells us.Ã¢ÂÂ (157 Cal.App.3d at pp. 218-219.) While it is true that the officerÃ¢ÂÂs state of mind during this encounter is not relevant on the issue of whether there is a detention, his communication of that state of mind by his actions is relevant. (People v. Bailey, supra, 176 Cal.App.3d at p. 407.) There is no doubt in our mind that the actions in the case at bar rose to the level of detention by reason of the acts of the police officer.
The case is remanded to the trial court with directions to grant the appellants Ã¢ÂÂ motions to suppress made pursuant to Penal Code section 1538.5.

COOPERMAN, P. J.
Defendant Herbert Pagel appeals from a judgment of conviction following a jury trial at which time he was found guilty as charged in a misdemeanor complaint of violating Vehicle Code section 20001 (hit-and-run resulting in injury).
His sole assignment of error concerns the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs granting of the PeopleÃ¢ÂÂs motion to dismiss the selected jurors and to quash the remaining first panel of prospective jurors on the ground that defendant had exercised his peremptory challenges systematically to exclude Blacks from the jury.
We find no error.
I. Procedural and Factual Background
The record, in relevant part, reflects the following transpired during the initial jury selection process on December 11 and 12, 1984.
During voir dire defendant, through his attorney, exercised his first three peremptory challenges against prospective jurors Darrell S. Street, Carol Pinkney, and James T. Mitchell, each of whom is Black.
Street stated that he lived in Los Angeles in the general vicinity of Washington and Crenshaw Boulevards. He was single and worked as a billing supervisor in the home delivery department of the Los Angeles Times. He had no prior jury experience. Street disclosed that his brother was a retired deputy sheriff, that several of his neighbors were attorneys, and that a Court of Appeal justice lived nearby.
Pinkney stated that she lived in Inglewood and that she was separated from her husband. She also disclaimed any prior jury experience. Out of the presence of the other jurors, Pinkney disclosed that her estranged husband had been shot by the police when he was arrested for being under the influence of PCP, that her brother had been arrested for carrying a loaded weapon in his vehicle, and that she herself had been recently stopped at gunpoint by police officers who believed that the vehicle she was driving, which was her own, had been stolen. Pinkney further disclosed that she had been in four automobile accidents. She also stated that during the course of her employment as a ward clerk in a hospital she occasionally saw victims of automobile accidents.
Mitchell stated that he lived in the central part of Los Angeles and that he was single. He was employed as a recruiter for the Urban League. Mitchell *Supp. 4expressed several complaints against law enforcement officers and the court system. In particular he was concerned about the treatment his brother had received many years earlier after his brother was found to be insane when he killed MitchellÃ¢ÂÂs father.
Following defendantÃ¢ÂÂs third peremptory challenge, the prosecutor approached the bench and expressed her concern about defendantÃ¢ÂÂs apparent attempts to excuse all prospective Black jurors. The trial court agreed that her concern was warranted under Wheeler. (People v. Wheeler (1978) 22 Cal.3d 258 [148 Cal.Rptr. 890, 583 P.2d 748].) The court then pointed out that defendant is White while both the victim and the PeopleÃ¢ÂÂs witnesses are all Black.
Defense counsel responded by positing various reasons for excusal of the three Black prospective jurors. He asserted that Mitchell was excused because he perceived Mitchell as a person who had Ã¢ÂÂa chip on his shoulder with the entire court systemÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ and who could not render a fair and impartial decision. Defense counsel also claimed that MitchellÃ¢ÂÂs negative attitude towards law enforcement would be unimportant to his defense strategy since law enforcement played a minimal role in this case.
The court expressly disagreed with this latter claim, pointing out that the testimony of the Black investigating officer would bring in certain statements made by defendant.
As for Pinkney, defense counsel explained that he believed that she also had so many problems with the court system that she could not be fair and impartial.
Finally, defense counsel stated that he Ã¢ÂÂreally [did not] have an answer regarding Mr. Street as I do with the other two.Ã¢ÂÂ He added, however, that regardless of race, he would have excused Pinkney and Mitchell.
When defense counsel announced that he had no plans to challenge the remaining Black on the panel, the prosecutor pointed out that there were no Black males remaining and that the one remaining Black was Mrs. Harris, a female.
The court deferred ruling on the Wheeler motion, and voir dire continued. Defendant later exercised a fourth peremptory challenge to excuse a White juror, Hannah Han-Rosebrock.
Prior to jury selection the next morning, the People presented additional argument in support of their motion. The court then found that the People *Supp. 5had made a prima facie showing that defendant had utilized peremptory challenges systematically on the basis of group bias. It next invited further explanations from defense counsel.
In response, defense counsel asked the court to consider his statements made on the previous day and added the following explanations: He had excused Street Ã¢ÂÂsolely on the basis that I thought he lived too close to the area where the accident occurred. He was single. I also noted, judge, that he was nodding off two times way before I dismissed him.Ã¢ÂÂ He excused Pinkney, because she was Ã¢ÂÂscatterbrained,Ã¢ÂÂ worked in a hospital, and had seen gunshot wounds and stabbings. She was therefore not someone defendant wanted to be deciding his fate. As for Mitchell, he reiterated his concern with MitchellÃ¢ÂÂs law enforcement problems, expressed his concern that Mitchell had caused an earlier disturbance in the court, and stated his belief that Ã¢ÂÂa person working on the Urban LeagueÃ¢ÂÂ should not be deciding what happens to defendant.
Defense counsel reminded the court that he had previously indicated that he would not challenge Mrs. Harris, who was in fact selected as a juror. He argued that Ã¢ÂÂwe are making too much out of the black race hereÃ¢ÂÂ and accused the People of attempting to exclude Whites systematically by dismissing four White jurors.
The prosecutor took exception to defense counselÃ¢ÂÂs stated reasons, essentially arguing that defense counsel was trying to cover his tracks with respect to the three Black prospective jurors who had been peremptorily excused. She pointed out that Mrs. Harris, who is Black and was not peremptorily challenged, had a one-and-one-half-year-old child. The Black victim was only two years old at the time of the incident. She also pointed out that defense counsel only challenged the White prospective juror after the Wheeler motion was made and that this particular person was in fact on the panel prior to Pinkney and Mitchell, who had been called to fill in slots left vacant by excused prospective jurors. The prosecutor also disclaimed any personal knowledge of Street nodding in court.
The trial court rejected the explanations proffered by defense counsel. The court announced that it was not satisfied that the peremptory challenges had been exercised for specific bias and found that the stated grounds were not reasonably relevant to the particular case on trial. The court noted that defense counsel had conducted only minimal voir dire questioning of the three excused prospective Black jurors, who were Ã¢ÂÂtwo males and a female with different and varied life experiences and backgrounds.Ã¢ÂÂ The court then dismissed the jury members selected thus far and quashed the remaining venire.
*Supp. 6On December 13, 1984, a new jury venire was empaneled. On December 17, 1984, a jury was selected without further objections by the prosecution or any objections by the defense as to the jury selection process.
II. Discussion
A peremptory challenge is Ã¢ÂÂan objection to a juror for which no reason need be given, but upon which the court must exclude him.Ã¢ÂÂ (Pen. Code, ÃÂ§ 1069.)
In People v. Wheeler, supra, 22 Cal.3d 258, our Supreme Court held that Ã¢ÂÂthe use of peremptory challenges to remove prospective jurors on the sole ground of group bias violates the right to trial by a jury drawn from a representative cross-section of the community under article I, section 16, of the California Constitution.Ã¢ÂÂ1 (Wheeler, supra, 22 Cal.3d 258, 276-277.) The Wheeler court explained that Ã¢ÂÂ[i]f a party believes his opponent is using his peremptory challenges to strike jurors on the ground of group bias alone, he must raise the point in timely fashion and make a prima facie case of such discrimination to the satisfaction of the court.Ã¢ÂÂ (Id., at p. 280.)
Initially, defendant argues that the Wheeler peremptory challenges restriction applies only to peremptory challenges exercised by the prosecution. He concludes that the court therefore erred in finding that the Wheeler principle applied to defendantÃ¢ÂÂs use of peremptory challenges against the three Black prospective jurors.
*Supp. 7We disagree.
Ã¢ÂÂIt has always been understood that public support for a system of justice depends not only on the capacity of that system to render justice in fact, but also on its ability to project to the parties and public an unimpeachable image of fairness. The peremptory challenge has long acted as a fixative for preserving that image. Its purpose has always been to insure that criminal trials are conducted before jurors who not only proclaim their impartiality, but whose ability to be evenhanded is not seriously questioned by the parties.Ã¢ÂÂ (People v. Williams (1981) 29 Cal.3d 392, 404 [174 Cal.Rptr. 317, 628 P.2d 869]; fn. omit.) Ã¢ÂÂ[I]t is not Ã¢ÂÂa function of the examination of prospective jurors ... to prejudice the jury for or against a particular party . . . (Id., at p. 408.)
In Wheeler, supra, 22 Cal.3d 258, the court expressly announced that Ã¢ÂÂthe People no less than individual defendants are entitled to a trial by an impartial jury drawn from a representative cross-section of the community. Furthermore, to hold to the contrary would frustrate other essential functions served by the requirement of cross-sectionalism [such as legitimating the judgments of the courts, promoting citizen participation in government, and preventing further stigmatizing of minority groups], . . . For example, when a white defendant is charged with a crime against a black victim, the black community as a whole has a legitimate interest in participating in the trial proceedings; thÃÂ¡t interest will be defeated if the prosecutor does not have the power to thwart any defense attempt to strike all blacks from the jury on the ground of group bias alone.Ã¢ÂÂ (Wheeler, supra, pp. 267, 282, at fns. 6, 29; see also, People v. Trevino (1985) 39 Cal.3d 667, 679 [217 Cal.Rptr. 652, 704 P.2d 719].)
DefendantÃ¢ÂÂs attempt to derogate the significance of such language as dicta is of no avail. It was in the context of expressly finding that the People have Ã¢ÂÂthe right to object to the same misuse of peremptory challenges on the part of defense counselÃ¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂunder the constitutional theory we adopt herein ...Ã¢ÂÂ that the Wheeler court made the observations quoted in the preceding paragraph. Accordingly, such language does not constitute merely an Ã¢ÂÂasideÃ¢ÂÂ or a Ã¢ÂÂthrow-away point.Ã¢ÂÂ Instead, it reflects the mandate of the California Supreme Court, which is a matter that this court cannot disregard.2
*Supp. 8DefendantÃ¢ÂÂs remaining contention concerns the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs finding that defendant failed to sustain his burden to justify his use of the peremptory challenges in question.3 Essentially, he asserts that the court was bound to accept his explanations.
We ^gain disagree.
Ã¢ÂÂIf the court finds that a prima facie case has been made, [which defendant here concedes,] the burden shifts to the other party to show if he can that the peremptory challenges in question were not predicated on group bias alone. The showing need not rise to the level of a challenge for cause. But to sustain his burden of justification, the allegedly offending party must satisfy the court that he exercised such peremptories on grounds that were reasonably relevant to the particular case on trial or its parties or witnessesÃ¢ÂÂ i.e., for reasons of specific bias. . . . He, too, may support his showing by reference to the totality of the circumstances: for example, it will be relevant if he can demonstrate that in the course of this same voir dire he also challenged similarly situated members of the majority group on identical or comparable grounds. And again we rely on the good judgment of the trial courts to distinguish bona fide reasons for such peremptories from sham excuses belatedly contrived to avoid admitting acts of group discrimination. Ã¢ÂÂ (Wheeler, supra, 22 Cal.3d at pp. 281-282.)
In the present case the trial court expressly stated that it was not satisfied with the explanations put forward by defendant, especially as to prospective Juror Street. We uphold the courtÃ¢ÂÂs rejection of defendantÃ¢ÂÂs explanations as unsatisfactory.
Ã¢ÂÂ[I]t is imperative, if the constitutional guarantee is to have real meaning, that once a prima facie case of group bias appears the allegedly offending party [is] required to come forward with explanation to the court that demonstrates other bases for the challenges and that the court satisfy itself that the explanation is genuine. This demands of the trial judge a sincere and reasoned attempt to evaluate the . . . explanation in light of the circumstances of the case as then known, his knowledge of trial techniques, and his observations of the manner in which the [offending party] has examined members of the venire and has exercised challenges for cause or peremptorily. . . .Ã¢ÂÂ (People v. Hall (1983) 35 Cal.3d 161, 167-168 [197 Cal.Rptr. 71, 672 P.2d 854].)
*Supp. 9From the foregoing recital of law it is clear that the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs determination of specific bias or group bias revolves around the issue of credibility.4 Ã¢ÂÂQuestions as to the credibility of witnesses and the weight to be given their testimony are for the trier of facts, and, ... it is the trier of facts who must determine to what extent testimony is to be believed or disbelieved.Ã¢ÂÂ (Pierson v. Superior Court (1970) 8 Cal.App.3d 510, 518 [87 Cal.Rptr. 433].) Similarly, it is the function of the trial court to evaluate and determine the genuineness of the explanations offered by the offending party to rebut the inference of impermissible group bias. (Hall, supra, 35 Cal.3d at pp. 167-168.) As an appellate court, we cannot retry credibility. (People v. French (1978) 77 Cal.App.3d 511, 523 [143 Cal.Rptr. 782].) Instead, we must defer to the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs assessment of the proffered explanations. (See, e.g., People v. Clay (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 433, 453 [200 Cal.Rptr. 269]; cf. id., at pp. 455-456; People v. Randle (1982) 130 Cal.App.3d 286, 295 [181 Cal.Rptr. 745]; see also, People v. Johnson (1978) 22 Cal.3d 296, 299-300 [148 Cal.Rptr. 915, 583 P.2d 774] [where proffered reason was insufficient as a matter of law].)
The judgment is affirmed.
Bernstein, J., and Reese, J., concurred.

The right to a trial Ã¢ÂÂby impartial and unprejudiced jurorsÃ¢ÂÂ is implicit in the right to a jury trial guaranteed by article I, section 16, of the California Constitution. (Wheeler, supra, at p. 265.) It is now settled, however, that the Sixth AmendmentÃ¢ÂÂs express guaranty of an impartial jury is applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment to the federal Constitution. (Duncan v. Louisiana (1968) 391 U.S. 145, 149 [20 L.Ed.2d 491, 496, 88 S.Ct. 1444].)
Recently, the United States Supreme Court in Batson v. Kentucky (1986) 476 U.S. 79 [90 L.Ed.2d 69, 106 S.Ct. 1712] held that Ã¢ÂÂthe StateÃ¢ÂÂs privilege to strike individual jurors through peremptory challenges, is subject to the commands of the Equal Protection Clause. . . . [T]he Equal Protection Clause forbids the prosecutor to challenge potential jurors solely on account of their race or on the assumption that black jurors as a group will be unable impartially to consider the StateÃ¢ÂÂs case against a black defendant.Ã¢ÂÂ (Id., at p. 89 [90 L.Ed.2d at pp. 82-83]; fn. omit.) The Supreme Court, however, stated: Ã¢ÂÂWe express no views on whether the Constitution imposes any limit on the exercise of peremptory challenges by defense counsel.Ã¢ÂÂ (Id., at p. 89, fn. 12 [90 L.Ed.2d at p. 82].) Nonetheless, the court observed that Ã¢ÂÂ[t]he harm from discriminatory jury selection extends beyond that inflicted on the defendant and the excluded juror to touch the entire community. Selection procedures that purposefully exclude black persons from juries undermine public confidence in the fairness of our system of justice. Discrimination within the judicial system is most pernicious because it is Ã¢ÂÂa stimulant to that race prejudice which is an impediment to securing to [black citizens] that equal justice which the law aims to secure to all others.Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ (Id., at p. 88 [90 L.Ed.2d at pp. 81-82].)


In People v. Trevino, supra, 39 Cal.3d 667 our Supreme Court stated: Ã¢ÂÂIn Wheeler we suggested that the People also have the right under the representative cross-section requirement to challenge the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs use of peremptory challenges. That issue is not now before this court.Ã¢ÂÂ (Id., at p. 682, fn. 10.) We note that the word Ã¢ÂÂsuggestedÃ¢ÂÂ detracts somewhat from the force of what we perceive the Wheeler mandate to be. Nonetheless, the Trevino court did not in fact disapprove or overrule the language in Wheeler giving rise to such right. We therefore conclude that the mandate remains intact and must be implemented on the facts presented in the present case.


DefendantÃ¢ÂÂs justification below that the People systematically excluded White potential jurors must be rejected summarily. Defendant cannot sustain his burden Ã¢ÂÂby attempting to cast a different burden on his opponent.Ã¢ÂÂ (Wheeler, supra, at p. 283, fn. 30.)


In Hall the court deemed Ã¢ÂÂit unnecessary to remind counsel, whether prosecutor or defender, of their legal and ethical responsibilities to seek justice and to offer only truthful reasons for the exercise of peremptory challenges.Ã¢ÂÂ (Hall, supra, at p. 169, fn. 11.)

Opinion
SOVEN, J.
Defendants Guadron, Mejia and Gamez appeal from a judgment in an unlawful detainer action in favor of plaintiff William Little. We reverse.
Facts
In 1978 plaintiff landlord rented the unit involved to one Pedro Gamez, the son of defendant Guadron. The unit was rented on a month-to-month oral lease. As of November 1983, the rent was $195.78. The unit was subject to the City of Los Angeles Rent Stabilization Ordinance.
Defendant Guadron claimed she had moved into the unit with her son Pedro in August 1978 and had lived there continuously. In September 1983, *Supp. 3defendant Mejia moved into the unit. In November 1983, Pedro Gamez moved out and another son, defendant Elias Gamez, moved into the unit. While Pedro Gamez was living in the unit he always paid the rent. Defendant Guadron never told plaintiff that she also lived in the unit, and after Pedro moved out, she continued to pay the rent under the name of Pedro Gamez.
On about December 23, 1983, defendant Guadron paid $196 in rent. Plaintiff, who did not know that persons other than Pedro were occupying the unit, learned about this time that Pedro Gamez had moved out the preceding month and that the unit was occupied by defendants.
On December 27, 1983, at plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs request or demand, defendants signed a rental agreement which provided for a monthly rental of $265.
On May 5, 1984, defendants were served with a three-day pay or quit notice demanding rent for February, March and April at $265 a month and $69 due from January. Defendants did not pay the rent and plaintiff filed this action in unlawful detainer. Defendants filed an answer generally denying the allegations in the complaint and affirmatively alleging that the rent demanded in the notice exceeded the legal amount which could be demanded under the City of Los Angeles Rent Stabilization Ordinance.
After a court trial, judgment was entered in favor of plaintiff. However, the court granted defendantsÃ¢ÂÂ application for a stay of execution pending appeal conditioned on defendants paying the judgment and rent at the rate of $265 a month.1
Discussion
The parties agree that the monthly rent of $265 is a lawful rent under the Los Angeles City Rent Stabilization Ordinance (RSO) if the December 1983 written agreement constitutes a lawful Ã¢ÂÂre-rentalÃ¢ÂÂ of the unit within the meaning of RSO. Defendants contend, however, that no Ã¢ÂÂre-rentalÃ¢ÂÂ occurred and that the agreement for a rent of $265 a month constituted an unlawful demand for rent. We agree with defendants.
We conclude that each defendant is either a cotenant with the original occupant,2 a lawful subtenant, or a lawful assignee; that a Ã¢ÂÂre-rentalÃ¢ÂÂ under *Supp. 4the rent stabilization ordinance does not occur where a unit is occupied by a cotenant, lawful subtenant or lawful assignee; and therefore under RSO, the rent cannot be increased other than in compliance with RSO while the unit continues to be occupied by one of the defendants.
The relevant portions of RSO provide as follows:
Section 151.02 defines a tenant as a Ã¢ÂÂtenant, subtenant, lessee, sublessee or any other person entitled to use or occupancy of a rental unit.Ã¢ÂÂ
Section 151.04 provides that it shall be unlawful for any landlord to Ã¢ÂÂdemand, accept or retain more than the maximum adjusted rent permitted
Section 151.06 (C) provides that Ã¢ÂÂif the rental unit was vacated voluntarily ... the maximum rent . . . may be increased to any amount upon the re-rental of the rental unit,Ã¢ÂÂ and Ã¢ÂÂas long as the rental unit continues to be rented to one or more of the same persons, no other rent increase shall be imposed pursuant to this subsection.Ã¢ÂÂ
Defendants contend, and we agree, that nothing in the 1978 oral tenancy prohibited the tenant Pedro Gamez from subleasing or assigning the lease in defendantsÃ¢ÂÂ favor, and nothing in the oral tenancy restricted the number of persons entitled to live with Pedro when he moved into the unit.
The law is clear that in the absence of a covenant or condition to the contrary the tenant may make an assignment or sublease. (3 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (8th ed. 1973) Real Property, ÃÂ§ 481, pp. 2163-2164.) It is not disputed that the 1978 oral lease made no provision for any matter other than the payment of rent.
Plaintiff contends that until the rental agreement was signed in December 1983, defendants were occupying the premises without plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs consent or permission. However, plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs consent or permission was not required under the terms of the 1978 oral agreement. Plaintiff also contends that the effect of adopting defendantsÃ¢ÂÂ position is to establish a Ã¢ÂÂrevolving doorÃ¢ÂÂ rule which will permit wholesale circumvention of the Ã¢ÂÂvacancy decontrolÃ¢ÂÂ provisions of the rent control law. PlaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs concerns are misplaced on the facts of this case.
Nothing in this opinion prevents a landlord from requiring a new tenant to sign a written agreement that either provides for a maximum number of tenants, specifies the tenants by name, prohibits assignment, prohibits subleasing or all of the above conditions. Indeed, even if only an oral rental *Supp. 5agreement is involved, the landlord is free to mark the first rent receipt with the names of authorized tenants.
If any of defendants are still in possession under the terms of the stay order, defendants would be entitled to a credit reflecting the difference in the lawful rent under RSO for the unit and the rent paid.
The judgment is reversed. Costs to appellant.
Bernstein, P. J., and Reese, J., concurred.

The record does not indicate whether defendants are still in possession.


At oral argument, plaintiff appeared to concede that defendant Guadron moved into the unit with her son Pedro, a lawful tenant. However, when Guadron moved into the unit is irrelevant in this case.

*Supp. 11Opinion
COLVIN, P. J.
The People appeal from the order of the court below granting respondentÃ¢ÂÂs motion to suppress made pursuant to Penal Code section 1538.5.1
I. Statement of Facts
The facts as adduced at the hearing on the suppression motion are as follows.
The Democratic National Convention was held in San Francisco during July 1984. On July 19, presidential candidate Senator Gary Hart was staying in the St. Francis Hotel in San Francisco. Special Agent Poggi of the United States Secret Service was assigned as the Ã¢ÂÂlead advance agentÃ¢ÂÂ for the detail assigned to protect Hart. Hart planned to walk from his hotel to the Meridien Hotel to meet Vice President Mondale. This event was public, but the fact that Hart was going to walk, and shake hands along the way, was not.
The chief witness at the suppression hearing was Special Agent Poggi, who was assigned to guard presidential candidate Senator Gary Hart on July 19, 1984, in San Francisco. Agent Poggi had nine years experience in the Secret Service at the time of this incident. He had a standard operating procedure he was trained to use when assigned to protect a public figure who would be shaking hands on a Ã¢ÂÂrope line.Ã¢ÂÂ2 This procedure involved conducting searches of persons in the crowd.
The search was a light patdown search, and the persons to be searched were chosen in two ways. A general search was done on all persons two or *Supp. 12three people deep into the crowd. A target search was done on persons anywhere in the crowd who seemed Ã¢ÂÂsuspiciousÃ¢ÂÂ to the agent.

The General Search

Poggi testified that when his protectee was about to shake hands on a rope line, Poggi would go behind the barricade, or line, and search the first two or three people-deep in the crowd for weapons around the waist. He has done thousands of these types of searches. Ã¢ÂÂ[Ujsually itÃ¢ÂÂs just a general frisk wherein the people donÃ¢ÂÂt even actually know they are being searched for weapons.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂThe public would be between myself and the protectee. I would be behind the public, moving up. And just basically moving them by putting my hands on their waist and saying Ã¢ÂÂExcuse meÃ¢ÂÂ and as I move them I would sweep around their waist and go on to the next person.Ã¢ÂÂ
At the request of respondentÃ¢ÂÂs counsel, this search was demonstrated to the court by Poggi. The court gave the following description of the search: Ã¢ÂÂIt appears that the agent walked up behind [respondentÃ¢ÂÂs attorney], put both hands one on each side at approximately around the waist area, and moved her to the side when he was saying Ã¢ÂÂExcuse meÃ¢ÂÂ ... I think he said Ã¢ÂÂExcuse me, step aside,Ã¢ÂÂ words to that effect. And at the same time it appears thatÃ¢ÂÂand she was moved to his left. And at the same time the agent apparently, from my observation, put your left hand behind the back.Ã¢ÂÂ Counsel for respondent noted, in addition, that the left hand continued a sweeping movement around the entire waist which moved her jacket aside slightly as it happened. The agentÃ¢ÂÂs body made contact with her right shoulder as he passed by.
Poggi testified that he has had reactions to this search, but not violent ones; in his opinion the search was not offensive to most people.

The Target Search

The target search was the identical waistband search, again usually done without the subjectÃ¢ÂÂs awareness of the search, but performed on a person targeted by the Secret Service agent as a suspicious person in the crowd.
At 10:30 a.m. on July 19, Agent Poggi left the St. Francis Hotel by the Post Street exit. Post Street was blocked off to the public, but 50 to 75 people were gathered behind metal police barricades on Powell. Senator Hart was five minutes behind Poggi.
As Poggi looked toward the crowd of people on Powell Street, he saw respondent, who was about 50 to 75 feet away. PoggiÃ¢ÂÂs attention was at first *Supp. 13drawn to respondent because of a physical similarity between respondent and Arthur Bremmer, a man Poggi knew was in jail as a result of his conviction of shooting Governor Wallace in 1972. RespondentÃ¢ÂÂs hair was extremely short, almost shaved.
Poggi approached the crowd on Powell Street with another agent right behind him. He was able to communicate with other agents via an earphone radio system.
As he came closer to where respondent was standing, Poggi noticed that respondent was dressed much more casually than the rest of the crowd, who were wearing slacks or sport coats. Respondent was fidgeting and seemed nervous. He was playing with his hands. Poggi was obviously a Secret Service agent, and in a secured area, but respondent avoided all eye contact with Poggi.
At this point, Agent Poggi made the decision to do a targeted search of respondent for weapons.
Poggi went behind the barricade, alone, to be able to come up behind respondent and search him. He had to move five or six people to get to respondent from the rear. Ã¢ÂÂI did a general search on those people also. Saying Ã¢ÂÂExcuse meÃ¢ÂÂ and I put my hand and actually physically moved them and searched them at the same time.Ã¢ÂÂ
As he approached respondent, he saw that respondent had a fanny pack on. As Poggi approached respondent, he put his hands lightly on his side and said Ã¢ÂÂExcuse meÃ¢ÂÂ as if he was going to move him like everyone else. PoggiÃ¢ÂÂs hands were on what he called respondentÃ¢ÂÂs Ã¢ÂÂlove rolls,Ã¢ÂÂ and he was touching respondent Ã¢ÂÂvery, very lightly.Ã¢ÂÂ
Respondent spun right into PoggiÃ¢ÂÂs face; because of the quickness of the spin, Poggi characterized it as violent, although there was no violence in the sense that respondent tried to hit Poggi or snarled. Since Poggi was right up behind respondent, respondent turned into PoggiÃ¢ÂÂs face; respondent did not step forward to get closer to PoggiÃ¢ÂÂs face.3
Poggi said Ã¢ÂÂPolice Officer. DonÃ¢ÂÂt move. I am going to check you for weapons.Ã¢ÂÂ
Poggi at that point squeezed the fanny pack and immediately felt a hard object. After he felt the hard object, he commanded respondent not to move. *Supp. 14Respondent was not free to leave. Poggi unzipped the fanny pack and saw the handle of a gun. He threw respondent to the ground and covered him with his body. Respondent was subsequently arrested without a warrant.
Respondent subsequently filed a pretrial motion to suppress the gun pursuant to California Penal Code section 1538.5.
The court below found that Agent Poggi had subjective cause to search respondent, but did not find objectively reasonable probable cause. Accordingly, the court below granted respondentÃ¢ÂÂs motion to suppress.4
II. Discussion

Scope of Review

The California Supreme Court explained in detail the scope of review on appeal from a section 1538.5 motion in People v. Leyba (1981) 29 Cal.3d 591 [174 Cal.Rptr. 867, 629 P.2d 961]:
[Ã¢ÂÂIn the first step the trial court must Ã¢ÂÂfind the factsÃ¢ÂÂ relating to the challenged search or seizure: e.g., it must decide what the officer actually perceived, or knew, or believed, and what action he took in response. These are traditional questions of fact .... Ã¢ÂÂOn appeal all presumptions favor the exercise of that power, and the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs findings on such matters, whether express or implied, must be upheld if they are supported by substantial evidence.Ã¢ÂÂ
Ã¢ÂÂNo less important, however, is the second step of the process. As we observed in [People v.] Lawler [(1973) 9 Cal.3d 156 (107 Cal.Rptr. 13, 507 P.2d 621)], Ã¢ÂÂThe trial court also has the duty to decide whether, on the facts found, the search was unreasonable within the meaning of the *Supp. 15Constitution.Ã¢ÂÂ . . . Because Ã¢ÂÂthat issue is a question of law,Ã¢ÂÂ the appellate court is not bound by the substantial evidence standard in reviewing the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs decision thereon. . . . On that issue, in short, the appellate court exercises its independent judgment.
Ã¢ÂÂThis general rule governs the particular instance of evidence obtained as a result of an investigative stop. It is now settled that Ã¢ÂÂin order to justify an investigative stop or detention the circumstances known or apparent to the officer must include specific and articulable facts causing him to suspect that (1) some activity relating to crime has taken place or is occurring or about to occur, and (2) the person he intends to stop or detain is involved in that activity. Not only must he subjectively entertain such a suspicion, but it must be objectively reasonable for him to do so; the facts must be such as would cause any reasonable police officer in a like position drawing when appropriate on his training and experience [citation], to suspect the same criminal activity and the same involvement by the person in question. [Citations.]
Ã¢ÂÂApplying the Lawler rule to the foregoing analysis, we observe that the first issue to be decided, i.e., whether the officer subjectively entertained a suspicion that there was criminal activity afoot and the person he intended to stop was involved in it, is a question of fact: the officer either did or did not have that suspicion at the time he acted. Under Lawler, therefore, review of a trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs finding on that issue is limited by the substantial evidence test.  But the next step in the inquiry, i.e., whether it was objectively reasonable for the officer to entertain that suspicion, is a question of law: it implicates the constitutional standard of reasonablenessÃ¢ÂÂa standard, as Lawler recognizes, that the appellate courts have the Ã¢ÂÂultimate responsibilityÃ¢ÂÂ to administer. It follows that the substantial evidence test does not limit review of this issue, and the appellate court must make an independent determination whether the officerÃ¢ÂÂs suspicion was constitutionally reasonable in the circumstances of the case.Ã¢ÂÂ] {Id. at pp. 596-597 [fns. omitted].)
The facts bearing on the legality of the search in this case are undisputed. The trial judge implicitly found on the undisputed facts that Agent Poggi had subjective cause to search respondent. Accordingly, there is no factual issue entitled to a substantial evidence standard of review. This court need only determine whether the facts fit within constitutional restrictions on searches.
The issue to be determined by this court is whether there was in fact an intrusion upon a reasonable expectation of privacy which would trigger a *Supp. 16Fourth Amendment analysis, and, if there was such an intrusion, whether Agent Poggi had objectively reasonable constitutionally required cause.

Is a Fourth Amendment Analysis Appropriate?

The threshold question for this court is whether respondent had a Fourth Amendment right which was violated when the agent initially touched his waist area with the intent to conduct an around the waist pat search. If that question is answered in the negative, the problem becomes whether the subsequent continuation of that search, which included touching the fanny pack, was in violation of respondentÃ¢ÂÂs rights.
The cornerstone of Fourth Amendment rights is a reasonable expectation of privacy, since the Fourth Amendment protects only those expectations of privacy that society finds legitimate. See Katz v. United States (1967) 389 U.S. 347 [19 L.Ed.2d 576, 88 S.Ct. 507], holding that the Fourth Amendment does not protect the merely subjective expectation of privacy, but only Ã¢ÂÂone that society is prepared to recognize as Ã¢ÂÂreasonable.Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ (Id. at p. 361 [19 L.Ed.2d at p. 588].)
Is the expectation of privacy asserted by respondent in the area around his waist one that society recognizes as reasonable? Ã¢ÂÂNo single factor determines whether an individual legitimately may claim under the Fourth Amendment that a place should be free of government intrusion not authorized by warrant.Ã¢ÂÂ (Oliver v. United States (1984) 466 U.S. 170, 177-178 [80 L.Ed.2d 214, 223, 104 S.Ct. 1735, 1741].)
It could be argued that respondent did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy since he chose to place himself in close proximity to a presidential candidate under tight security, and he should have known that he would be subject to strict scrutiny by Secret Service agents. The strong governmental and individual interest in a voting public that has access to its representatives, however, weighs against accepting this argument. Respondent has a right to gather with other members of the public to see and hear his representatives or political candidates.
This court believes that the fact that respondent was in a public place close to Gary Hart is not relevant under the circumstances of this case to the issue of whether respondent had a legitimate expectation of privacy. Ã¢ÂÂAn individual who enters a place defined to be Ã¢ÂÂpublicÃ¢ÂÂ for Fourth Amendment analysis does not lose all claims to privacy or personal security. [Citations.] For example, the Fourth AmendmentÃ¢ÂÂs protections against. . . unreasonable seizure of effects upon the person remain[s] fully applicable.Ã¢ÂÂ (Id. at p. 179 [80 L.Ed.2d at p. 225].) Ã¢ÂÂ[T]he Fourth Amendment protects *Supp. 17peopleÃ¢ÂÂand not simply Ã¢ÂÂareasÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂagainst unreasonable searches and seizures.Ã¢ÂÂ (Katz v. United States, supra, 389 U.S. at p. 353 [19 L.Ed.2d at p. 583].) Ã¢ÂÂUnquestionably petitioner was entitled to the protection of the Fourth Amendment as he walked down the street in Cleveland.Ã¢ÂÂ (Terry v. Ohio (1968) 392 U.S. 1, 9 [20 L.Ed.2d 889, 899, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 1873].)
And accordingly, this court finds that respondent had a reasonable expectation of privacy which was intruded upon when Agent Poggi touched his waist area.  This initial Ã¢ÂÂvery lightÃ¢ÂÂ touch was sufficient to trigger respondentÃ¢ÂÂs Fourth Amendment rights.5

The Balancing Test: Given the GovernmentÃ¢ÂÂs Interests and the Amount of Intrusion, What Ã¢ÂÂCauseÃ¢ÂÂ is Constitutionally Required?

Where a reasonable expectation of privacy exists, the Fourth Amendment prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures by federal law enforcement officers.6 This restriction is applicable not only to police officers, but *Supp. 18also to governmental activity in general. (New Jersey v. T.L.O. (1985) 469 U.S. 325, 335 [83 L.Ed.2d 720, 730, 105 S.Ct. 733, 740].) Ã¢ÂÂThe basic purpose of this Amendment ... is to safeguard the privacy and security of individuals against arbitrary invasions by governmental officials.Ã¢ÂÂ (Camara v. Municipal Court (1967) 387 U.S. 523, 528 [18 L.Ed.2d 930, 935, 87 S.Ct. 1727, 1732].)
If a legitimate privacy interest is intruded upon by the government, then the Fourth Amendment requires a balancing of interests: given the totality of the circumstances, was the search justified? Ã¢ÂÂJustificationÃ¢ÂÂ is not a constant, but rather is a variable; depending on the weight of the governmentÃ¢ÂÂs interests, the weight of the individualÃ¢ÂÂs privacy interests, and the extent, or nature and scope, of the intrusion, varying amounts of justification are necessary. This balancing test has been set out many times by the U.S. Supreme Court. Ã¢ÂÂ[I]n determining whether the seizure and search were Ã¢ÂÂunreasonableÃ¢ÂÂ our inquiry is a dual oneÃ¢ÂÂwhether the officerÃ¢ÂÂs action was justified at its inception, and whether it was reasonably related in scope to the circumstances which justified the interference in the first place.Ã¢ÂÂ (Terry v. Ohio, supra, 392 U.S. at pp. 19-20 [20 L.Ed.2d at p. 905].) There is Ã¢ÂÂno ready test for determining reasonableness other than by balancing the need to search against the invasion which the search entails.Ã¢ÂÂ (Camara v. Municipal Court, supra, 387 U.S. at p. 523, 536-537 [18 L.Ed.2d 930, 940].) Whether a search is reasonable Ã¢ÂÂdepends on the context within which a search takes place. The determination of the standard of reasonableness . . . requires Ã¢ÂÂbalancing the need to search against the invasion which the search entails.Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ (New Jersey v. T.L.O., supra, 469 U.S. at p. 337 [83 L.Ed.2d at p. 731], citing Camara v. Municipal Court, supra, 387 U.S. 523.) Frequently, the result of this balancing analysis has been the finding that a suspicion meeting the level of probable cause is required in order to justify the search or seizure.  In certain instances, probable cause is not required, and a reasonable suspicion will suffice. (New Jersey v. T.L.O., supra, 469 U.S. at p. 340 [83 L.Ed.2d at p. 734], citing Terry v. Ohio, supra, 392 U.S. 1 and other federal cases.) Ã¢ÂÂWhere a careful balancing of governmental and private interests suggests that the public interest is best *Supp. 19served by a Fourth Amendment standard of reasonableness that stops short of probable cause, we have not hesitated to adopt such a standard.Ã¢ÂÂ (Ibid.7 See also Florida v. Royer (1983) 460 U.S. 491 [75 L.Ed.2d 229, 103 S.Ct. 1319].) Ã¢ÂÂThe predicate permitting seizures on suspicion short of probable cause is that law enforcement interests warrant a limited intrusion on the personal security of the suspect. The scope of the intrusion permitted will vary to some extent with the particular facts and circumstances of each case. This much, however, is clear: an investigative detention must be temporary and last no longer than is necessary to effectuate the purpose of the stop. Similarly, the investigative methods employed should be the least intrusive means reasonably available to verify or dispel the officerÃ¢ÂÂs suspicion in a short period of time. [Citations.] It is the StateÃ¢ÂÂs burden to demonstrate that the seizure it seeks to justify was sufficiently limited in scope and duration to satisfy the conditions of an investigative seizure.Ã¢ÂÂ (Florida v. Royer, supra, 460 U.S. at p. 500 [75 L.Ed.2d at p. 238].)
Accordingly, even if the search in question is an exception to the rule that probable cause and a warrant are required, then in addition to at least reasonable suspicion, the scope of the search must be strictly limited in scope Ã¢ÂÂto that which is justified by the particular purposes served by the exception.Ã¢ÂÂ (Florida v. Royer, supra, 460 U.S. at p. 500 [75 L.Ed.2d at p. 238].)

The Government Interest

Ã¢ÂÂApplying these principles to this case, we consider first the nature and extent of the governmental interests involved.Ã¢ÂÂ (Terry v. Ohio, supra, 392 U.S. at p. 22 [20 L.Ed.2d at p. 906].) In Terry, the governmental interests were those of crime prevention and detection and the Ã¢ÂÂmore immediate interest of the police officer in taking steps to assure himself that the person with whom he is dealing is not armed with a weapon that could unexpectedly and fatally be used against him.Ã¢ÂÂ (Id. at p. 23 [20 L.Ed.2d at p. 907].)
The governmentÃ¢ÂÂs interest in the present case likewise was a safety interest. Agent PoggiÃ¢ÂÂs job was to protect Senator Hart. Senator Hart, as a presidential candidate, was in a position of special risk. This country has *Supp. 20witnessed, particularly in recent years, many assassinations and attempted assassinations both of presidential candidates and Presidents.
Prior to the Civil War, none of 15 Presidents was assassinated.8 Since that time, 4 of 24 presidents have been assassinated. If successful and unsuccessful attempts made on the lives of presidential candidates and presidents are included, the pattern becomes more alarming.9
In 1963, John F. Kennedy was shot and killed with a rifle in Dallas, Texas, by Lee Harvey Oswald. On June 5, 1968, Robert F. Kennedy was shot and killed with a pistol in Los Angeles, California, by Sirhan Sirhan. On May 15,1972, George Wallace, giving a campaign speech in a shopping center in Laurel, Maryland, was shot and paralyzed from the waist down by Arthur Bremmer. On September 5, 1975, there was an assassination attempt on President Gerald Ford in Sacramento by Lynette Ã¢ÂÂSqueakyÃ¢ÂÂ Fromme. On September 22, 1975, another attempt on President FordÃ¢ÂÂs life was made by Sara Jane Moore in San Francisco. On March 30, 1981, an attempt was made on President ReaganÃ¢ÂÂs life by John Hinckley in Washington.
In light of this history we cannot blind ourselves, any more than the Terry court could, to the need of law enforcement officers to protect office seekers from violence in situations where they lack probable cause to arrest.10
*Supp. 21Ã¢ÂÂThe wide attention the President receives makes him a logical targetÃ¢ÂÂ if anything about an assassination act can be said to be logicalÃ¢ÂÂfor those wishing to punish a nation, to strike out at a symbolically powerful figure whom they project as the source of their grievances, to drastically alter governmental policy, or to draw attention to themselves as the author of a memorable event. In addition, the current methods [personal appearances on the campaign trail] by which presidential candidates seek nomination and election provide many opportunities for assassins.Ã¢ÂÂ11 The presidency is the focus of public attention, and those who seek that high office symbolize that office.
The election process, and every adult citizenÃ¢ÂÂs right to vote for oneÃ¢ÂÂs representatives must be preserved and protected. The free election process is protected when its participants are kept safe.
Here, not only was there a general government interest in crime prevention and detection, but there was also a more immediate interest in preserving the election process and in the safety of Senator Hart and the general public in the crowd. This constitutes a substantial government interest.

The Private Interest

Since there exists a substantial governmental interest which justified the initiation of some kind of search, this court must ask whether the least intrusive means available was used to safeguard this interest. Ã¢ÂÂThe scope of the search must be Ã¢ÂÂstrictly tied to and justified byÃ¢ÂÂ the circumstances which rendered its initiation permissible.Ã¢ÂÂ (Terry v. Ohio, supra, 392 U.S. at p. 19 [20 L.Ed.2d at p. 904] citing Warden v. Hayden (1967) 387 U.S. 294, 310 [18 L.Ed.2d 782,794, 87 S.Ct. 1642, 1652].) Thus, an individualÃ¢ÂÂs interest is directly proportional to the scope and intrusiveness of the search. The smaller the intrusion, the less weight the individualÃ¢ÂÂs interest is given in Fourth Amendment balancing.
When the United States Supreme Court decided Terry .v. Ohio, supra, 392 U.S. 1, it rejected the idea that the Terry-type stop and frisk was a minimal intrusion: Ã¢ÂÂ[I]t is simply fantastic to urge that [a careful exploration of the outer surfaces of a personÃ¢ÂÂs clothing all over his or her body in an attempt to find weapons] performed in public by a policeman while the citizen stands helpless, perhaps facing a wall with his hands raised, is a Ã¢ÂÂpetty indignity.Ã¢ÂÂ It is a serious intrusion upon the sanctity of the person, *Supp. 22which may inflict great indignity and arouse strong resentment, and it is not to be undertaken lightly.Ã¢ÂÂ {Id. at pp. 16-17 [20 L.Ed.2d at p. 903],)1 **********12
In the present case, the intrusion amounted to a very light touch around the waist, similar to a touch any person in the crowd might have inflicted on respondent. While this is irrelevant to the issue of whether respondent had a reasonable expectation of privacy, it is crucial to the question of intrusiveness. The touch was minimal. The agent testified that he had never had adverse responses to the around-the-waist search he used, and that it was especially planned so that it would not bother the people who received it.

The Standard for Constitutionally Required Cause

This courtÃ¢ÂÂs conclusion, and evaluation of the proper balance, is that in these circumstances the governmental interest is of sufficient magnitude, and the intrusion on respondentÃ¢ÂÂs privacy is sufficiently minimal, so that only a reasonable belief, not rising to the level of probable cause, would justify the initial pat-search.

Did Agent Poggi Articulate Sufficient Factors to Support an Objectively Reasonable Belief That Respondent Was Armed?

Courts have long wrestled with the amorphous concept of constitutional cause, whether it takes the form of probable cause or reasonable belief. Out of a constantly evolving line of cases have arisen a few standards which guide us today.
To begin with, it is the totality of the circumstances which must be considered. (Illinois v. Gates (1983) 462 U.S. 213, 230-231 [76 L.Ed.2d 527, 543-544, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 2328].)13
*Supp. 23The agent listed several factors which produced his decision to do this target search: the agentÃ¢ÂÂs nine years of experience in this type of situation, respondentÃ¢ÂÂs refusal to make eye contact, casual dress and extremely short haircut, and fidgeting and nervousness. Agent Poggi also testified that he knew Senator Hart was approximately five minutes behind him.
Experience of the officer is an appropriate consideration in many cases. Ã¢ÂÂCircumstances and conduct which would not excite the suspicion of the man on the street might be highly significant to an officer who had had extensive training and experience.Ã¢ÂÂ (People v. Superior Court (Kiefer) (1970) 3 Cal.3d 807, 827 [91 Cal.Rptr. 729, 742, 478 P.2d 449]. See also In re Tony C. (1978) 21 Cal.3d 888, 893 [148 Cal.Rptr. 366, 372, 582 P.2d 957]; People v. Brown, supra, 169 Cal.App.3d at p. 165.)
Agent Poggi worked for the Secret Service, a federal agency whose clearly enumerated, specific duties have included the protection of United States Presidents since 1901. In 1968, the agencyÃ¢ÂÂs duties were expanded to include protection of presidential candidates. Agent Poggi also testified that he had worked over 16,000 hours in the role of an agent protecting designated protectees, and that his formal training included 16 weeks in Secret Service schools in addition to on-the-job training. He testified that in Secret Service school most of the training was for protection, and that in-service training included assassination-prevention training. Agent Poggi had reviewed this assassination-prevention training immediately prior to the 1984 campaign.
Given Agent PoggiÃ¢ÂÂs extensive training for this type of situation, were the factors he enumerated as the basis for his suspicion sufficient to render the suspicion reasonable?
*Supp. 24In many cases, refusal to make eye contact, has been expressly rejected as a Ã¢ÂÂprobable causeÃ¢ÂÂ factor. For example, in People v. Loewen, supra, the court said: Ã¢ÂÂAnother factor Deputy Cozart relied on to justify the detention was that the occupants of the truck looked away when they approached. Cozart testified that their failure to continue looking at him was suspicious because Ã¢ÂÂ[mjost people have a habit of looking at a patrol car when they pass it.Ã¢ÂÂ However, he admitted that neither man attempted to hide his face or otherwise conceal his identity as the truck passed.Ã¢ÂÂ (35 Cal.3d 117, 126.) The facts of the case at bar are distinguishable, however. Here, Special Agent Poggi was not merely in a car on the freeway; he looked directly at respondent, got as close as two feet from respondent, and was obviously a Secret Service agent. In People v. Brown, supra, 169 Cal.App.3d 159 [215 Cal.Rptr. 101], refusal to look the officer in the eye was, in combination with other criteria, a valid consideration in the formation of objectively reasonable probable cause to arrest.
Likewise, nervousness, or fidgeting, have met with skepticism on the part of courts when proposed as elements of probable cause. Taken in conjunction with other articulable factors, however, these factors can be important. Ã¢ÂÂWhile it is true that, taken in isolation, running down the street or the manifestation of nervousness in the presence of a police officer would not constitute adequate grounds to detain a citizen on the street, the combination of circumstances here amounts to considerably more.Ã¢ÂÂ {People v. Brown, supra, 169 Cal.App.3d at p. 164, italics added.) In that case, manifestation of the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs nervousness included staring at the officer as opposed to avoiding eye contact; his hands were shaking, and he was pale.
Under the combined circumstances of this case, respondentÃ¢ÂÂs refusal to make eye contact with Agent Poggi and his fidgeting were a legitimate part of the formation of a reasonable suspicion.
Here, we find that in the circumstances of this particular case, the suspicion initially entertained by Agent Poggi was reasonable and articulable, sufficient to support the initial, minimally intrusive, waist-pat search commenced by Poggi, although it did not rise to the level of suspicion necessary for a Terry-type frisk-and-detain, or to the level of probable cause to arrest.

Was There Cause to Search the Fanny Pack and Arrest?

Since the initial search of respondentÃ¢ÂÂs waistband area was justified in the opinion of this court, the issue of whether the search of the fanny pack and subsequent arrest of respondent were justified arises.
RespondentÃ¢ÂÂs spinning around would not be a legitimate basis on which to ground the finding of probable cause if there was no justification *Supp. 25to initially touch respondent. In People v. Loewen, the court pointed out that there is no duty to cooperate with the police: Ã¢ÂÂ[A]n Ã¢ÂÂindividual, unless he or she is properly detained and so notified, is as free to avoid [an] officer as to avoid any other person.Ã¢ÂÂ . . . Ã¢ÂÂ[A]n outright refusal to cooperate with police officers cannot create adequate grounds for an intrusion which would otherwise be unjustifiable. ... If the right to be free from unjustified detentions is lost merely by seeking to avoid such encounters, then the right is meaningless; . . .Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ (35 Cal.3d at p. 128, italics added.)
In the instant case, this court is of the opinion that the initial intrusion was, in fact, otherwise justifiable, rendering the rule enunciated in Loewen inapposite.
Once respondent violently spun around, Agent PoggiÃ¢ÂÂs objectively reasonable suspicion was heightened, not dissipated. At this point, he continued his around-the-waist pat search for weapons, which had been interrupted by respondentÃ¢ÂÂs spin, telling respondent not to move. Respondent was not free to leave. At this stage, Agent Poggi had reasonable cause to detain and frisk for weapons under Terry v. Ohio, supra, 392 U.S. 1: there was a safety risk, and the initial suspicion had increased.
When the agent felt the hard object in the fanny pack around respondentÃ¢ÂÂs waist, he clearly had full probable cause to unzip the fanny pack. The ensuing unveiling of the gun in respondentÃ¢ÂÂs fanny pack gave rise to probable cause to arrest.
III. Conclusion
The setting in which the search and arrest of respondent took place was unquestionably one of very high risk. A nationally known candidate for president of the United States was following less than five minutes behind Agent Poggi. Respondent contends that no manÃ¢ÂÂs life is more precious than any other, and that the Constitution takes priority over the safety of any one person. We agree with that contention. But the magnitude of the risk to the SenatorÃ¢ÂÂs life is the issue here. The decision in Terry v. Ohio, supra, 392 U.S. 1, was not a declaration that policemenÃ¢ÂÂs lives are any more valuable than any one elseÃ¢ÂÂs, but a recognition that in some circumstances, a policeman may be in a position of magnified risk. Likewise, this court believes that Senator Hart was in a position of magnified risk at the time Agent Poggi undertook the pat search of respondent.
In the absence of precedent for this particular set of circumstances, this court must return to the balancing test analysis set forth in the Fourth Amendment cases cited above. The governmental interest in preventing *Supp. 26assassinations, or attempted assassinations, was sufficient in light of all the circumstances of this case to justify the pat search of respondent. This limited intrusion is justified by a reasonable suspicion not rising to the level of probable cause,  The factors articulated by Agent PoggiÃ¢ÂÂrespondentÃ¢ÂÂs nervousness, fidgeting, refusal to make eye contact, and unusual haircut and dressÃ¢ÂÂconsidered in conjunction with the high crime situation14 which existedÃ¢ÂÂwere sufficient to justify the patdown and search of the fanny pack.
The order granting respondentÃ¢ÂÂs motion to suppress is reversed.
Dossee, J., and Grant, J., concurred.

All code references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise stated. The original complaint charged the violation of section 12025, subdivision (b) as a felony in reliance on the theory that respondent had previously been convicted of a crime against property, specifically, a trespass. Respondent filed a demurrer to the complaint, contending that a trespass was not a crime against property within the meaning of section 12025, subdivision (b). This demurrer, along with a common law motion to suppress the gun, was denied. When respondentÃ¢ÂÂs section 995 motion was heard in superior court, he successfully challenged the previous municipal court ruling that a trespass was a crime against property within the meaning of section 12025, subdivision (b). The case was then remanded to municipal court, and the amended complaint was filed. Respondent moved to suppress the gun under section 1538.5; the municipal court judge refused to hear the motion on the ground that a common law motion to suppress the gun had been heard and denied by a municipal court judge at the time that respondentÃ¢ÂÂs demurrer to the complaint was overruled. Respondent secured a writ of mandate from the superior court, the 1538.5 motion was heard, and this appeal followed.


A Ã¢ÂÂrope lineÃ¢ÂÂ was described by Agent Poggi as any sort of barricade separating the protectee, here Senator Hart, from the public. The barricades used in this case were metal police barricades.


This spin, or turn, was demonstrated for the trial court at the suppression hearing by Agent Poggi and Agent Dale.


The ruling of the court below was as follows: Ã¢ÂÂ(The Court): Well, let me tell you this: This case causes me a lot of concern because I was very impressed by the agent. ... I donÃ¢ÂÂt know how to say this with a straight face, but he should be commended for his action and at the same timeÃ¢ÂÂI think he performed a valuable serviceÃ¢ÂÂat the same time ... he said that was in fact a search. There was no articulable facts to say he knew at the time he searched Mr. Carlson that any crime had been committed or was about to be committed .... For my reasoning, so you can have it reviewed, thatÃ¢ÂÂs basically the way I perceive it: The fact that he was nervous and wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt look at the agent and he was fidgety, I think it was, and the fact that he didnÃ¢ÂÂt wear the same kind of clothes, that wasÃ¢ÂÂI donÃ¢ÂÂt think that was enough actually objectively from my perspective to justify the search. Maybe a stop and detention or something of that nature as in Tony C., but he actually conducted a search. And so my perception of it is that based upon the overall context of the matter I donÃ¢ÂÂt think there was enough to justify the search. I donÃ¢ÂÂt know how to say that . . . from an individual perspective and from the Constitutional perspective, I donÃ¢ÂÂt think there was enough to justify the search.Ã¢ÂÂ


This court has also considered the notion that respondentÃ¢ÂÂs waist area was, after a fashion, in plain view; that is, that it could be said that since any member of that crowd could have felt respondentÃ¢ÂÂs waist area, and it was arguably foreseeable that someone in the crowd would bump up against respondent and feel the area around his waist, then Agent PoggiÃ¢ÂÂs touch was limited to areas in Ã¢ÂÂplain view,Ã¢ÂÂ accessible by members of the public. The plain view doctrine has a requirement of inadvertence, however, which was not met here.
Additionally, the People argue, inter alia, that no search was involved here until after respondent spun around. In other words, the touching of respondentÃ¢ÂÂs waist area was not a Ã¢ÂÂstopÃ¢ÂÂ or Ã¢ÂÂdetentionÃ¢ÂÂ but was a mere Ã¢ÂÂcontact,Ã¢ÂÂ which did not implicate Fourth Amendment rights. Here, had all gone according to PoggiÃ¢ÂÂs usual routine, there would have been no detention, since the Secret ServiceÃ¢ÂÂs practice in this Ã¢ÂÂrope lineÃ¢ÂÂ situation was to touch without detaining. The People argue that what Poggi did in touching respondentÃ¢ÂÂs Ã¢ÂÂlove rollsÃ¢ÂÂ was something that any citizen in the crowd might have done. The California Supreme Court has been explicit as to the rule on this, however. Ã¢ÂÂIf the individual is stopped or detained because the officer suspects he may be personally involved in some criminal activity, his Fourth Amendment rights are implicated and he is entitled to the safeguards of the rules set forth above. But similar safeguards are not required if the officer acts for other proper reasons .... such as giving aid to persons in distress, mediating domestic quarrels, assisting the elderly or the disabled, [etc.]Ã¢ÂÂ (In re Tony C. (1978) 21 Cal.3d 888, 895 [148 Cal.Rptr. 366, 370, 582 P.2d 957].) The prosecution has the burden of proof if it contends that a stop or detention was for a purpose other than to investigate the defendant as a suspect in criminal activity. {Id. at p. 896.) This burden was not met. Here, the testimony of Agent Poggi shows that respondent was the target; he was approached because he was suspicious looking. He was not approached for some kind of pleasantry. The fact that Agent Poggi did not intend that respondent be aware of the search does not alter this. The contact in this instance, although slight, was sufficient to trigger respondentÃ¢ÂÂs Fourth Amendment rights under the test set forth in Tony C.


In Terry v. Ohio, supra, 392 U.S. 1, the United States Supreme Court said: Ã¢ÂÂIf this case involved police conduct subject to the Warrant Clause of the Fourth Amendment, we would have to ascertain whether Ã¢ÂÂprobable causeÃ¢ÂÂ existed to justify the search and seizure which took place. However, that is not the case. We do not retreat from our holdings that the police must, whenever practicable, obtain advance judicial approval of searches and seizures through the warrant procedure, see, e.g., Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347 [19 L.Ed.2d 576, 88 *Supp. 18S.Ct. 507] (1967); Beck v. Ohio, 379 U.S. 89, 96 [13 L.Ed.2d 142, 147-148, 85 S.Ct. 223] (1964); Chapman v. United States, 365 U.S. 610 [5 L.Ed.2d 828, 81 S.Ct. 776] (1961), or that in most instances failure to comply with the warrant requirement can only be excused by exigent circumstances, see, e.g., Warden v. Hayden, 387 U.S. 294 [18 L.Ed.2d 782, 87 S.Ct. 1642] (1967) (hot pursuit); cf. Preston v. United States, 376 U.S. 364, 367-368 [11 L.Ed.2d 777, 780-781, 84 S.Ct. 881] (1964). But we deal here with an entire rubric of police conductÃ¢ÂÂnecessarily swift action predicated upon on-the-spot observations of the officer on the beatÃ¢ÂÂwhich historically has not been, and as a practical matter could not be, subjected to the warrant procedure. Instead, the conduct involved in this case must be tested by the Fourth AmendmentÃ¢ÂÂs general proscription against unreasonable searches and seizures.Ã¢ÂÂ (Id. at p. 20 [20 L.Ed.2d at p. 905] [fn. omitted].) Likewise, the conduct of Agent Poggi must be tested under the analysis used for unreasonable searches and seizures.


The New Jersey case, supra, 469 U.S. 325, dealt with the issue of the Fourth Amendment standard to be used in searches of students in a high school, and held that only reasonable suspicion, not probable cause, was required of school officials who searched the students. Ã¢ÂÂBy focusing attention on the question of reasonableness, the standard will spare teachers and school administrators the necessity of schooling themselves in the niceties of probable cause and permit them to regulate their conduct according to the dictates of reason and common sense. At the same time, the reasonableness standard should ensure that the interests of students will be invaded no more than is necessary to achieve the legitimate end of preserving order in the schools.Ã¢ÂÂ (Id. at pp. 343-344 [83 L.Ed.2d at pp. 735-736].)


In 1835, there was an attempted shooting of Andrew Jackson by Richard Lawrence in Washington, D.C., but the gun misfired. (8 Kirkham et al., Assassins and Political Violence, A Report to the National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence (1969).)


Ã¢ÂÂ[T]he presidency has been the object of a disproportionate number of the assassination attempts directed against officeholders in the United States.Ã¢ÂÂ (Kirkham, op. cit. supra, at p. 49.)
1835: attempt on Andrew Jackson.
1865: Abraham Lincoln killed.
1881: James Garfield killed.
1901: William McKinley killed. In response to this assassination, the Secret Service was given the new responsibility of protecting the president.
1912: attempt on candidate Theodore Roosevelt.
1933: attempt on Franklin D. Roosevelt three weeks prior to inauguration.
1950: attempt on Harry S. Truman.
1963: John F. Kennedy killed.
1968: Robert Kennedy killed.
1972: attempt on George Wallace.
1975: two attempts on Gerald Ford.
1981: attempt on Ronald Reagan.


Or, as the court put it in Terry v. Ohio, supra, 392 U.S. 1: Ã¢ÂÂCertainly it would be unreasonable to require that police officers take unnecessary risks in the performance of their duties. American criminals have a long tradition of armed violence, and every year in this country many law enforcement officers are killed in the line of duty, and thousands more are wounded. Virtually all of these deaths and a substantial portion of the injuries are inflicted with guns and knives.
Ã¢ÂÂIn view of these facts, we cannot blind ourselves to the need for law enforcement officers to protect themselves and other prospective victims of violence in situations where they may lack probable cause for an arrest.Ã¢ÂÂ (Id. at pp. 23-24 [20 L.Ed.2d at p. 907].)


 Assassins and Political Violence, A Report to the National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence, supra, at page 107.


interestingly, in the more recent case of New Jersey v. T.L.O., supra, 469 U.S. 325, the Supreme Court referred to the Terry frisk as a Ã¢ÂÂlimited intrusion.Ã¢ÂÂ (Id. at p. 337 [83 L.Ed.2d at p. 732].)


There has been some waffling on the part of appellate courts in California as to whether factors add up to more than the sum of their parts or not. The language Ã¢ÂÂwhether considered separately or togetherÃ¢ÂÂ appears frequently in appellate opinions, e.g., People v. Aldridge (1984) 35 Cal.3d 473, 478 [198 Cal.Rptr. 538, 674 P.2d 240]; In re Tony C., supra, 21 Cal.3d 888. In People v. Loewen (1983) 35 Cal.3d 117, 128-129 [196 Cal.Rptr. 846, 672 P.2d 436] the court said: Ã¢ÂÂIn determining the reasonableness of a detention, this court acknowledges that Ã¢ÂÂthe totality of the circumstancesÃ¢ÂÂthe whole pictureÃ¢ÂÂmust be taken into account. . . .Ã¢ÂÂ [Citation.] [t] . . . [I] In this case, Officer CozartÃ¢ÂÂs good faith suspicion that the occupants of the truck had engaged in or were about to engage in criminal activity was not reasonable. None of the four factors Cozart testified to [nervousness, increase of thefts in the area, failing to look at officer, speeding up of truck] satisfied the Tony C. test. Nor did they Ã¢ÂÂmysteriously become imbued with an aura of guilt merely by viewing them in their *Supp. 23Ã¢ÂÂtotality.Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ [Citation.] To borrow from Justice Mosk, four Ã¢ÂÂtimes zero, in [this courtÃ¢ÂÂs] arithmetic, still equals zero.Ã¢ÂÂ [Citation.]Ã¢ÂÂ
On the other hand, in People v. Brown, (1985) 169 Cal.App.3d 159 [215 Cal.Rptr. 101], the Court of Appeal held that factors not enough in isolation became sufficient when combined.
Ã¢ÂÂWhile it is true that, taken in isolation, running down the street or the manifestation of nervousness in the presence of a police officer would not constitute adequate grounds to detain a citizen on the street, the combination of circumstances here amounts to considerably more. [1] Here, the officer saw appellant leave the bank corridor which he knew provided access to the bank only, running at full speed with his head down. Appellant was not jogging but running at full speed in a downtown area, having just left the bank. As appellant came near and looked up and saw the officer, he immediately stopped running, began walking at a fast pace and continued to stare at the officer. He began.turning pale and his hands began to shake. AppellantÃ¢ÂÂs reaction to the officer was extreme. The officer had never seen anyone react that way to him merely upon seeing the officer. . . .Ã¢ÂÂ (Id. at p. 164.)

CHAPMAN, P. J.

Statement of the Case.

Defendant, Catherine Pogre was charged in the Municipal Court, Santa Clara County Judicial District with a violation of Penal Code section 647, subdivision (b), which provides: Ã¢ÂÂEvery person who commits any of the following acts is guilty of disorderly conduct, a misdemeanor: ...(b) Who solicits ... or who engages in any act of prostitution____As used in this subdivision, Ã¢ÂÂprostitutionÃ¢ÂÂ includes any lewd act between persons for money or other consideration.Ã¢ÂÂ She was also charged with having suffered a prior conviction for the same offense.
A jury trial was conducted commencing on May 13, 1985, and on May 15, 1985, the prosecutor rested. The court thereupon granted defendantÃ¢ÂÂs motion for a judgment of acquittal pursuant to Penal Code section 1118.1, which provides: Ã¢ÂÂIn a case tried before a jury, the court on motion of the defendant... at the close of the evidence on either side and before the case is submitted to the jury for decision, shall order the entry of a judgment of acquittal of one or more of the offenses charged in the accusatory pleading *Supp. 4if the evidence then before the court is insufficient to sustain a conviction of such offense or offenses on appeal.Ã¢ÂÂ
Thereafter, on June 12, 1985, the defendant moved to seal all records of the arrest and prosecution pursuant to Penal Code section 851.8, subdivision (e).1 Without hearing any additional evidence, and apparently basing its decision on the trial record, the trial court granted the motion and ordered aU records of the arrest and prosecution to be sealed. The district attorney appeals this order.2
The issues on appeal were briefed by the parties, and oral arguments were heard on May 1,1986. The matter was thereupon ordered submitted for decision. Thereafter, upon consideration of the briefs, we noted that the defendant takes the position that the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs decision was based on its assessment of the evidence presented at the trial, and that the prosecutor had not presented this court with a transcript of the trial. Therefore, we set aside our order submitting the matter and ordered the record augmented to include the trial transcript. We have reviewed that transcript, and set forth herein our understanding of the evidence adduced at the trial, and again ordered the matter submitted for decision.

*Supp. 5
Statement of Facts.

Officer George, of the San Jose Police Department, was assigned to the vice unit to investigate escort agencies dealing in prostitution. On February 13, 1984, Officer George responded to an advertisement in the yellow pages of the phone book advertising a service called the Ã¢ÂÂEmpress Escorts.Ã¢ÂÂ
In preparation Officer George went to the EZ-8 Motel and reserved two adjoining rooms. Officer George planned to use one room supported by a radio transmitter, and to have back-up officers in the other. He then made a telephone call to Empress Escorts. A female answered the phone and informed him that the escort services would cost $160 per hour, and asked the caller his name and address. The female ended the conversation by saying someone would call shortly.3
A few minutes later, another female called and asked directions to the motel. She gave her name as Melissa, and gave a description of herself. Forty minutes later the second female called again and said her car had broken down. Officer George then drove an undercover police car to pick her up. He identified defendant, Catherine Lynn Pogre, as the person he picked up and drove back to his motel.
The defendant, Catherine Lynn Pogre, is a lawyer with a prior conviction for soliciting an act of prostitution.
Once in the room defendant asked Officer George for some identification. He showed her a card without a picture. She then demanded to see an identification card with a picture. Officer George refused, saying it would give her the means for blackmail. She continued to demand to see an identification with a picture. He again refused and asked her to leave.
At the door defendant said she knew he was not a cop, but that he was acting like one. He invited her back in to talk about it. When he closed the door she asked him for the $ 160 cash, which he gave her in city funds. Defendant then told Officer George to take his clothes off, because cops did not like to take their clothes off. Officer George then went into the bathroom, took his clothes off, wrapped a towel around himself and came out. At this point he found defendant on the telephone and heard her say: Ã¢ÂÂYes, he has I.D.Ã¢ÂÂ Defendant then took her clothes off.
*Supp. 6Officer George asked defendant what she did best. She responded by saying: Ã¢ÂÂWhatever you like.Ã¢ÂÂ or Ã¢ÂÂWhat do you like best?Ã¢ÂÂ Officer George then asked defendant what she didnÃ¢ÂÂt like to do. She then asked him the same question. He said: Ã¢ÂÂWell, I would like to get laid.Ã¢ÂÂ Officer George added that he may have said he wanted sexual intercourse. The defendant said: Ã¢ÂÂO.K., give me a hug,Ã¢ÂÂ and walked toward him with her arms open.
At this point Officer George gave his cover signal, and the other officers entered and identified themselves as police. Defendant thereupon yelled: Ã¢ÂÂYou mother fucker!Ã¢ÂÂ and ran toward Officer George, trying to hit and kick him. Defendant was then arrested.
After the arrest they took defendantÃ¢ÂÂs picture in the nude, and searched her belongings. In her purse they found the $ 160 in city funds, a condom, a pager, and a credit card printer.
The district attorney rested on this evidence, and it was on this evidence that the trial court granted defendantÃ¢ÂÂs motion pursuant to Penal Code section 1118.1, and ordered the clerk of the court to enter a judgment of acquittal. And it was on this evidence, apparently, that the trial court later found defendant to be factually innocent of the charge.

Statement of Law.

Defendant contends that the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs decision in this matter is binding on the Court of Appeal, and that a judgment of acquittal justifies the trial court in ordering the record to be sealed. Defendant further contends that the procedures, and burdens of proof set forth in section 851.8, subdivision (b) are inapplicable in such a case. We disagree as to each contention.
Defendant does not have a constitutional right to have the record sealed. Whatever his right, it is based entirely on statute. (Loder v. Municipal Court (1976) 17 Cal.3d 859 [132 Cal.Rptr. 464, 553 P.2d 624].) The Loder court lists the many reasons why public interests are served by maintaining accurate records of arrests and prosecutions, (id. at pp. 864-868) and concludes, on page 868: Ã¢ÂÂTaken together, the multiple purposes for which police, prosecutors, courts and probation and parole authorities may consult records of arrests not resulting in conviction thus constitute a substantial governmental interest.Ã¢ÂÂ
Penal Code section 851.8, subdivision (e), relied upon by the trial court, authorizes relief whenever a person is acquitted of a charge only when it appears to the trial judge that the defendant was factually innocent of the charge brought to trial. The procedures for determining whether defendant *Supp. 7is factually innocent are set forth in section 851.8, subdivision (b). Despite defendantÃ¢ÂÂs contention to the contrary, given the substantial governmental interest involved, as discussed in Loder v. Municipal Court, supra, 17 Cal.3d 859, we believe a statute setting forth a uniform procedure, and apportioning the burden of proof, to be most desirable. Section 851.8, subdivision (b) provides that the determination of factual innocence is not to be determined on the trial record alone, but the trial judge may also consider declarations, affidavits, police reports, or any other evidence submitted by the parties which is material, relevant and reliable. Furthermore, the statute specifically provides that evidence which might otherwise be considered illegally seized and subject to suppression under Penal Code section 1538.5 is admissible on the issue of factual innocence. In our opinion, evidence excised from the police reports as a sanction for destruction of the tapes, should likewise have been admissible on the issue of factual innocence. In any event, the statutory procedure set forth in section 851.8, subdivision (b) is well designed to present the issue in an orderly manner.
The statute, and case law, leave no room for a conclusion that an acquittal, per se, entitles the accused to have the record sealed. In People v. Glimps (1979) 92 Cal.App.3d 315, 321-322 [155 Cal.Rptr. 230], the court said: Ã¢ÂÂThe language of section 851.8 is unambiguous. Two specific requirements are imposed: (1) there must have been an acquittal, and (2) it must appear to the judge Ã¢ÂÂpresiding at the trial wherein such acquittal occurred that the defendant was factually innocent of the charge.Ã¢ÂÂ It is clear that acquittal is one condition of such relief but that not all acquittals justify sealing. Thus, acquittals for technical reasons usually will not justify sealing. Even an acquittal on the merits, which is Ã¢ÂÂmerely an adjudication that the proof at the prior proceeding was not sufficient to overcome all reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accusedÃ¢ÂÂ ... does nÃÂ³t suffice.... The Legislature thus recognized that the requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt often results that defendants, who are not factually innocent, are acquitted. It sought by section 851.8, however, to benefit those defendants who, after presentation of evidence, were found not to have committed a crime.... [If] Such history demonstrates conclusively that Ã¢ÂÂfactually innocentÃ¢ÂÂ as used in the section does not mean a lack of proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt or even by Ã¢ÂÂa preponderance of evidence.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ (Italics added, and citation omitted.)
We believe that an acquittal based on a defense of entrapment is the equivalent of an Ã¢ÂÂacquittal for technical reasons.Ã¢ÂÂ The defense of entrapment is available to a defendant who is otherwise guilty. Entrapment is a defense, not because the defendant is innocent but because it is a lesser evil that some criminals should escape than that the government should play an ignoble part. People v. Benford (1959) 53 Cal.2d 1, 9 [345 P.2d 928]. It would be *Supp. 8inappropriate to find that defendant has not committed a crime, and is therefore factually innocent, if in fact he is acquitted by reason of a defense of entrapment.
The court in People v. Glimps, supra, 92 Cal.App.3d 315, concluded, on page 321: Ã¢ÂÂA sealing order made without legislative authority is in excess of the courtÃ¢ÂÂs jurisdiction. When this fact appears from the record, it is void and must be set aside on motion at any time after its entry by the court which made the order.Ã¢ÂÂ
In People v. Scott M. (1985) 167 Cal.App.3d 688, at pages 698-699 [213 Cal.Rptr. 456], the court said that a Ã¢ÂÂjuryÃ¢ÂÂs verdict, which simply indicates that the prosecution did not prove the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, does not directly address whether he committed the charged offense ... it may, for example, have been based instead upon a failure of the prosecution to meet the reasonable doubt standard____The trial court does not Ã¢ÂÂdisagreeÃ¢ÂÂ with the juryÃ¢ÂÂs verdict when it denies a section 851.8 petition. It refines that verdict by distinguishing between those cases where acquittal is based upon actual innocence and those where acquittal is based upon the prosecutionÃ¢ÂÂs failure of proof.Ã¢ÂÂ
People v. Scott M., supra, 167 Cal.App.3d 688, agrees with the statement in People v. Glimps, supra, 92 Cal.App.3d 315, which we emphasized herein-above. On pages 699-700 the Scott court said: Ã¢ÂÂSection 851.8 is for the benefit of those defendants who have not committed a crime. It permits those petitioners who can show that the state should never have subjected them to the compulsion of the criminal law to purge the official records of any reference to such action____Hence, much more than a failure of the prosecution to convict is required in order to justify the sealing and destruction of records under section 851.8____If the Legislature had wanted to treat a verdict of acquittal as some sort of rebuttable presumption of factual innocence it could easily have so provided. Only in those cases where the defendant is actually innocent is the trial court justified in sealing and destroying a defendantÃ¢ÂÂs arrest records.Ã¢ÂÂ (Italics added.)
In Scott M., supra, 167 Cal.App.3d 688, the Court of Appeal held that a trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs decision denying relief pursuant to section 851.8, should be upheld Ã¢ÂÂif there exists some Ã¢ÂÂrational ground for assuming the possibility that an offense has been committed and that the defendant is guilty of it.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ (Id. at p. 699.)  In our case, of course, we determine whether there is any substantial evidence contradicted or uncontradicted which will support the finding by the trial court that defendant was factually innocent. (See People v. Reilly (1970) 3 Cal.3d 421, 425 [90 Cal.Rptr. 417, 475 P.2d 649]; Foreman *Supp. 9& Clark Corp. v. Fallon (1971) 3 Cal.3d 875, 881 [92 Cal.Rptr. 162, 479 P.2d 362].)
The standard to be used in determining factual innocence is set forth in the statute. Section 851.8, subdivision (b) provides: Ã¢ÂÂA finding of factual innocence ... shall not be made unless the court finds that no reasonable cause exists to believe that the arrestee committed the offense. . . .Ã¢ÂÂ  Reasonable cause has been defined as Ã¢ÂÂthat state of facts as would lead a man of ordinary care and prudence to believe and conscientiously entertain an honest and strong suspicion that the person is guilty of a crime.Ã¢ÂÂ (People v. Scott M. (1985) 167 Cal.App.3d 688, 699 [213 Cal.Rptr. 456].) It is against this standard that we examine the facts to determine if the trial judgeÃ¢ÂÂs order is supported by substantial evidence.
It goes without saying that the trial court has broad discretion to determine whether the standard required by section 851.8 has been met. In discussing judicial discretion the Supreme Court has said: Ã¢ÂÂ... discretion, however, is neither arbitrary nor capricious, but is an impartial discretion, guided and controlled by fixed legal principles, to be exercised in conformity with the spirit of the law, and in a manner to subserve and not to impede or defeat the ends of substantial justice.Ã¢ÂÂ (People v. Warner (1978) 20 Cal.3d 678, 683 [143 Cal.Rptr. 885, 574 P.2d 1237].) Such discretion is abused when an order Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂexceeds the bounds of reason, all the circumstances being considered.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ (Ibid.).
We believe the facts speak for themselves. The advertisement in the yellow pages constituted a solicitation, the conduct and utterances of the defendant gave dimension and meaning to the solicitation. The word solicit means, among other things, Ã¢ÂÂto tempt or entice someone to do wrong.Ã¢ÂÂ (WebsterÃ¢ÂÂs New World Dict. (2d College Ed.).) We believe that a man of ordinary care and prudence would have been led to believe and conscientiously entertain an honest and strong suspicion that the defendant was there to commit an act of prostitution, i.e., sex for money, and was by both word and deed doing her best to solicit such an act, while at the same time taking care that she was not dealing with an undercover police officer, and presumably laying the foundation for a defense of entrapment in the event he was a police officer. Had there been consummation, no one could have doubted that an act of prostitution had occurred. Defendant is not entitled to the protection of a statute designed to protect those who have not committed a crime.
We find that the record, as we have reviewed it, does not support the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs finding of factual innocence. Certainly our task in reviewing the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs ruling in this case would have been greatly simplified had the trial *Supp. 10court made a statement of the reasons for its conclusions. In the case of In re Podesto (1976) 15 Cal.3d 921 [127 Cal.Rptr. 97, 544 P.2d 1297], the Supreme Court observed that appellate courts frequently have difficulty in ascertaining whether a trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs ruling has focused on appropriate criteria, because the trial court has not been required to articulate the grounds upon which it has relied. The court said on page 926: Ã¢ÂÂIn recent years, our court has had occasion to emphasize in a wide variety of contexts that governmental decisions which affect important individual interests should be accompanied by at least a brief statement of reasons explaining the basis for such decision.Ã¢ÂÂ [Citations omitted.] We believe such a brief statement is equally desirable where important governmental interests are at stake.
In the present case a short statement might have revealed that it was based on a conclusion by the trial court that none of the police testimony was credible, that the entire case was made up out of whole cloth. We think this is so unlikely as to be unreasonable. It is also possible that such a statement might have pointed to facts not evident to us in our review of the record. We think this too, to be unlikely in this case. It is more likely that the trial court based its order on an erroneous conclusion that the facts did not support an inference of solicitation to prostitution, or even more likely on an incorrect assumption that a defendant should be considered factually innocent if she was entrapped, or perhaps simply a mistaken conclusion that anyone acquitted was entitled to have the record sealed as a matter of law. In any event a brief statement would have greatly facilitated our decision.
The order of the trial court sealing the record pursuant to Penal Code section 851.8 is reversed. The case is remanded to the trial court with instructions to reinstate all records, and to so notify each of the agencies who received notice of its previous order.
Bonney, J., and Brown, J., concurred.

The subdivision provides: Ã¢ÂÂWhenever any person is acquitted of a charge and it appears to the judge presiding at the trial wherein such acquittal occurred that the defendant was factually innocent of such charge, the judge may grant the relief provided in subdivision (b).Ã¢ÂÂ Subdivision (b) in turn provides: Ã¢ÂÂ... [A] petition may be made to the municipal or justice court which would have had territorial jurisdiction over the matter. A copy of such petition shall be served on the district attorney of the county having jurisdiction over the offense at least 10 days prior to the hearing thereon. The district attorney may present evidence to the court at such hearing. Notwithstanding Section 1538.5 or 1539, any judicial determination of factual innocence made pursuant to this section may be heard and determined upon declarations, affidavits, police reports, or any other evidence submitted by the parties which is material, relevant and reliable. A finding of factual innocence and an order for the sealing and destruction of records pursuant to this section shall not be made unless the court finds that no reasonable cause exists to believe that the arrestee committed the offense for which the arrest was made. In any court hearing to determine the factual innocence of a party, the initial burden of proof shall rest with the petitioner to show that no reasonable cause exists to believe that the arrestee committed the offense for which the arrest was made. If the court finds that this showing of no reasonable cause has been made by the petitioner, then the burden of proof shall shift to the respondent to show that a reasonable cause exists to believe that the petitioner committed the offense for which the arrest was made. If the court finds the arrestee to be factually innocent of the charges for which the arrest was made, then the court shall order the law enforcement agency having jurisdiction over the offense, the Department of Justice, and any law enforcement agency which arrested the petitioner ... to seal their records____Ã¢ÂÂ


People v. White (1978) 77 Cal.App.3d Supp. 17 [144 Cal.Rptr. 128], holds that an order sealing a record pursuant to Penal Code section 851.8 is appealable as an order made after judgment affecting the substantial rights of of the People.


Apparently the conversations referred to by police witnesses were tape recorded. The tapes were no longer available by the time discovery motions were made in the trial court. As a sanction the trial court ordered that all references to such dialogue be excised from the police reports, and that the police witnesses to the conversations could not refer to any such reports to refresh their memory of the conversations. Therefore, the testimony of the officers was based on their best recollection without reference to their reports.

*Supp. 13Opinion
COOPERMAN, P. J.
Statement of Facts and Procedural History
On July 30, 1985, a complaint was filed in the Municipal Court for the Rio Hondo Judicial District charging respondent with being under the influence of an opiate in violation of Health and Safety Code section 11550, subdivision (a).
On August 1, 1985, counsel for respondent, who was in custody, moved to dismiss the misdemeanor complaint under the provisions of Penal Code section 991 on the ground that there was no probable cause to believe that respondent had committed the charged offense.1
During the hearing on the foregoing motion, the court considered the arrest report attached to the complaint, without objection.
The report stated that on July 28, 1985, the arresting officers Ã¢ÂÂ . . . saw two males walking on the sidewalk on the northside of the street in front of the Ã¢ÂÂWelcome Motel.Ã¢ÂÂ One of the males . . . [was] carrying a small brown bag partially folded down with a silver/blue can showing, distinctive of an alcoholic beverage.  Believing there was a beer in the bag, we decided to contact the males to wam/cite the male for . . . drinking an alcoholic beverage in public.Ã¢ÂÂ (Italics added.)2 Upon contacting the man who held the *Supp. 14bag, (one James Grayson), and finding the beer can unopened, the officers had no further contact with him. However, one of the officers then noticed that respondent WardÃ¢ÂÂs eyelids were droopy, and his movements slow. The officer observed WardÃ¢ÂÂs pupils, and found them to be constricted, and by reason of his experience in arresting and/or observing persons under the influence of opiates, decided that Ward was under the influence of an opiate, and arrested him.
Counsel for respondent, at the conclusion of the hearing, asked that the magistrate rule on the legality of the detention. In response thereto, the prosecutor asked whether the magistrate wished to calendar a motion under the provisions of Penal Code section 1538.5. To this, the magistrate replied: Ã¢ÂÂIt is a 991 motion here today, whether there is probable cause for arrest or whether it should be dismissed.Ã¢ÂÂ
On the following day, August 2, 1985, the prosecutor specifically objected to the magistrateÃ¢ÂÂs determining the validity of the detention on the motion under the provisions of Penal Code section 991. However, the court granted the foregoing motion on the ground that there was not Ã¢ÂÂ . . . any probable cause for the stop in the first place.Ã¢ÂÂ
The People filed a timely appeal of and from the foregoing order of dismissal.
Discussion
The People contend on appeal, as they did in the trial court, that the sole manner in which to challenge the legality of the detention and search in the case at bench is by a motion to suppress evidence under the provisions of Penal Code section 1538.5, and that respondentÃ¢ÂÂs filing of a motion for a determination of probable cause under the provisions of Penal Code section 991 was an attempt to bring a premature, unnoticed motion under Penal Code section 1538.5.
In this case of first impression, we hold that pursuant to a motion made under the provisions of Penal Code section 991, a trial court may properly consider the lawfulness of a detention or arrest in determining whether there is probable cause to believe that a defendant in custody has committed a misdemeanor.
In Gerstein v. Pugh (1975) 420 U.S. 103 [43 L.Ed.2d 54, 95 S.Ct. 854], the Supreme Court held that a defendant has a Fourth Amendment right to a judicial determination by a neutral magistrate as to whether there is *Supp. 15probable cause to believe that the defendant committed the crime with which he has been charged.
In the light of the decision in Gerstein, the California Supreme Court unanimously held in In re Walters (1975) 15 Cal.3d 738 [126 Cal.Rptr. 239, 543 P.2d 607], that California procedures governing pretrial detention of those charged with misdemeanors, and arrested with or without a warrant, Ã¢ÂÂ . . . do not presently comport with our implementation of the constitutional requirements of Gerstein, since the defendant is not afforded a post-arrest judicial determination that probable cause exists for his continued detention.Ã¢ÂÂ (At p. 747.) The California Supreme Court held, in Walters, that Gerstein Ã¢ÂÂprobable causeÃ¢ÂÂ hearings must be made available to defendants charged with the commission of a misdemeanor as well as to those charged with the commission of a felony.
Our Supreme Court pointed out that the requirements of Gerstein with respect to felony cases was satisfied by virtue of the provisions of Penal Code section 995. (See In re Walters, supra, 15 Cal.3d, at p. 752, fn. 8.) However, the court proceeded to hold, specifically, that a judicial determination of probable cause is required in every case in which a defendant charged with a misdemeanor is not released from custody prior to or at the time of arraignment, in the absence of a waiver of such determination. The court explained that since the posting of bail may impose an unwarranted burden on an accused, if probable cause to detain is lacking, he is entitled to have a determination made prior to electing whether to post bail, and that if the judicial officer finds that probable cause has not been established, the accused must be discharged from custody.
It is obvious that Penal Code section 991 is a legislative response to the requirements of Walters. In accordance with those requirements, section 991 provides that if a defendant charged with a misdemeanor is in custody at the time of arraignment, and has pleaded not guilty, Ã¢ÂÂ . . . the magistrate, on motion of counsel for the defendant or the defendant, shall determine whether there is probable cause to believe that a public offense has been committed and that the defendant is guilty thereof.Ã¢ÂÂ
In Walters, the Supreme Court made it clear that the lawfulness of an arrest is to be considered at such a postarrest Gerstein hearing (Gerstein v. Pugh, supra, 420 U.S. 103). The Supreme Court held that the magistrate in that case had made a proper probable cause determination at arraignment, in that police reports relied on by the trial judge recited facts personally observed by the arresting officer, which formed the basis of the officerÃ¢ÂÂs conclusion that an offense had been committed by the defendant in his presence.
*Supp. 16Similarly, Penal Code section 991, subdivision (c) provides that Ã¢ÂÂ[i]n determining the existence of probable cause, the magistrate shall consider any warrant of arrest with supporting affidavits, and the sworn complaint together with any documents or reports incorporated by reference thereto, which, if based on information and belief, state the basis of such information, or any other documents of similar reliability.Ã¢ÂÂ It is, accordingly, our determination that in so providing, the Legislature, following the specifications of Walters, has allowed a magistrate to determine the lawfulness of the custodial detention of a misdemeanant based upon the reading and consideration of an arrest report attached to the complaint, under the circumstances at bench.3
The People contend that Penal Code section 1538.5, subdivision (m) was amended in 1982 to include the reference to section 871.5 of the Penal Code as an additional means to test the legality of a search or seizure (Stats. 1982, ch. 1505, ÃÂ§ 6.), and that if the Legislature had intended that Penal section 991 also provide a remedy to test the legality of a search or seizure, it would have amended section 1538.5, subdivision (m) to include a reference to section 991.4 The PeopleÃ¢ÂÂs contention, however, is not persuasive.
It is settled law that courts have a duty to construe Penal Code sections in harmony with one another, so as to give effect to each. (Morse v. Municipal Court (1974) 13 Cal.3d 149, 159 [118 Cal.Rptr. 14, 529 P.2d 46]; People v. Tideman (1962) 57 Cal.2d 574, 583 [21 Cal.Rptr. 207, 370 P.2d 1007].) In this connection, we note that Penal Code sections 991 and *Supp. 171538.5 are not mutually exclusive, in that they serve different purposes.  The purpose of Penal Code section 991 is not to suppress evidence, but to provide a prompt means of protecting an accusedÃ¢ÂÂs Fourth Amendment rights, by allowing a neutral magistrate to look at specified documents to determine whether probable cause to hold a misdemeanant in custody exists. As is explained in In re Walters, supra, 15 Cal.3d 738, without the protection now provided by Penal Code section 991, we would be leaving to the prosecution alone, the determination of probable cause to detain in custody. Penal Code section 991 is obviously meant to be a safeguard against the hardship suffered by a misdemeanant who is detained in custody, by providing that a probable cause hearing will be held immediately, at the time of arraignment, unless the court grants a continuance for good cause of not to exceed three court days. Contrariwise, a motion under the provisions of Penal Code section 1538.5 may be brought even as late as trial.
Moreover, successful motions under the two sections reach qualitatively different results. A successful motion to suppress evidence under Penal Code Section 1538.5 will remove specific evidence from the courtÃ¢ÂÂs consideration.5 On the other hand, a successful probable cause challenge under the provisions of Penal Code section 991 results in the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs being discharged, subject, however, to the right of the prosecution to refile the complaint within 15 days of the dismissal. Such refiling is specifically provided for in Penal Code section 991, subdivision (e). (See fn. 1, ante, p. Supp. 13.)
We hold that in the case at bench, the trial court properly dismissed the complaint and discharged respondent.
The order of dismissal is affirmed.

Penal Code section 991 provides: Ã¢ÂÂ(a) If the defendant is in custody at the time he appears before the magistrate for arraignment and, if the public offense is a misdemeanor to which the defendant has pleaded not guilty, the magistrate, on motion of counsel for the defendant or the defendant, shall determine whether there is probable cause to believe that a public offense has been committed and that the defendant is guilty thereof.
Ã¢ÂÂ(b) The determination of probable cause shall be made immediately unless the court grants a continuance for good cause not to exceed three court days.
Ã¢ÂÂ(c) In determining the existence of probable cause, the magistrate shall consider any warrant of arrest with supporting affidavits, and the sworn complaint together with any documents or reports incorporated by reference thereto, which, if based on information and belief, state the basis for such information, or any other documents of similar reliability.
Ã¢ÂÂ(d) If, after examining these documents, the court determines that there exists probable cause to believe that the defendant has committed the offense charged in the complaint, it shall set the matter for trial [II] If the court determines that no such probable cause exists, it shall dismiss the complaint and discharge the defendant.
Ã¢ÂÂ(e) Within 15 days of the dismissal of a complaint pursuant to this section the prosecution may refile the complaint. [1J] A second dismissal pursuant to this section is a bar to any other prosecution for the same offense.Ã¢ÂÂ


Under the foregoing facts and circumstances, the officersÃ¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂcontactÃ¢ÂÂ of the two males was a detention. (See Wilson v. Superior Court (1983) 34 Cal.3d 777, 790 [195 Cal.Rptr. 671, 677 P.2d 325].)


Penal Code section 1204.5 is as follows: Ã¢ÂÂIn any criminal action, after the filing of any complaint or other accusatory pleading and before a plea, finding, a verdict of guilty, no judge of any court shall read or consider any written report of any law enforcement officer or witness to any offense, or any information reflecting the arrest or conviction record of a defendant, or any affidavit or representation of any kind, verbal or written, except as provided in the rules of evidence applicable at the trial, or with the consent of the accused given in open court, or affidavits in connection with the issuance of a warrant or the hearing of any law and motion matter, or any application for an order fixing or changing bail, or a petition for a writ.Ã¢ÂÂ
In In re Walters, supra, 15 Cal.3d 738, the California Supreme Court stated the following, relative to the foregoing code section, in footnote 7, at page 752: Ã¢ÂÂThe probable cause determination required under Gerstein is in the nature of a Ã¢ÂÂlaw and motionÃ¢ÂÂ matter within the meaning of section 1204.5. Therefore, the judge who reads the arrest report is not disqualified from further participation in the criminal proceedings involving the particular defendant.Ã¢ÂÂ


Penal Code section 1538.5, subdivision (m) is as follows: Ã¢ÂÂThe proceedings provided for in this section, Section 871.5, Section 995, Section 1238, and Section 1466 shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedies prior to conviction to test the unreasonableness of a search or seizure where the person making the motion for the return of property or the suppression of evidence is a defendant in a criminal case and the property or thing has been offered or will be offered as evidence against him. A defendant may seek further review of the validity of a search or seizure on appeal from a conviction in a criminal case notwithstanding the fact that such judgment of conviction is predicated upbn a plea of guilty. Such review on appeal may be obtained by the defendant providing that at some stage of the proceedings prior to conviction he has moved for the return of property or the suppression of the evidence.Ã¢ÂÂ


Penal Code section 1538.5, subdivision (d) provides as follows: Ã¢ÂÂIf a search or seizure motion is granted pursuant to the proceedings authorized by this section, the property or evidence shall not be admissible against the movant at any trial or other hearing unless further proceedings authorized by this section, Section 871.5, Section 1238, or Section 1466 are utilized by the people.Ã¢ÂÂ

SCHAUER, J.
This is an appeal by the plaintiff from an order dismissing the complaint (for violation of section 505 of the State Vehicle Code, i. e., Ã¢ÂÂreckless drivingÃ¢ÂÂ) without a trial of the action. As shown by the Engrossed Statement on Appeal, the order was made on the ground Ã¢ÂÂthat the Court had no jurisdiction to try the ease, in that it appeared that the complaint had been filed by the clerk [of the court] . . . upon the instruction of the . . . Judge presiding . . . after a request had been made to said Judge for a complaint by the complaining witness . . . and upon the further ground that said Judge had no authority under the law to issue said complaint, the right to issue the complaint being solely vested in the City Attorney of the City of Los AngelesÃ¢ÂÂ. It is to be noted that the city attorney claims no such monopoly of power and himself prosecutes this appeal on behalf of the plaintiff. The order must be reversed.
We find nothing in the Constitution or in other law which limits the jurisdiction of the municipal court in misdemeanor cases to those which have been instituted by a complaint prepared or Ã¢ÂÂissuedÃ¢ÂÂ by the city attorney. A criminal (misdemeanor) action in a municipal court is commenced by filing a verified complaint with the court within one year after the commission of the offense (secs. 1426, 1426a, 1461a, Pen. Code); if the judge is satisfied from a perusal of the complaint, that the offense complained of has been committed by the defendant, he must issue a warrant of arrest (sec. 1427, Pen. Code). The determination of the sufficiency of the complaint, the issuance of a warrant of arrest, the conduct of the proceeding and the ultimate disposition of the case are matters resting with the court rather than the city attorney.
A person may be arrested without a warrant, under certain circumstances, by either a peace officer (sec. 836, Pen. Code) or bj^ a private person (sec. 837, Pen. Code), and in either case the requirement is that (sec. 849, Pen. Code) Ã¢ÂÂthe person arrested must, without unnecessary delay, be taken before the nearest or most accessible magistrate in the county in which the arrest is made, and a complaint stating the charge against the person, must be laid before such magistrateÃ¢ÂÂ. There is no suggestion in the statute above quoted from, that the complaint must be drafted or approved or Ã¢ÂÂissuedÃ¢ÂÂ by any certain person or particular *Supp. 751officerÃ¢ÂÂthe sole exaction is that Ã¢ÂÂa complaint stating the charge against the person, must be laid before such magistrate Ã¢ÂÂ.  The provisions of subdivisions (6), (7) and (8) of section 42 of the Los Angeles City Charter, making it incumbent upon the city attorney to draft complaints, Ã¢ÂÂinstitute Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ and conduct proceedings and generally act as attorney for the plaintiff in misdemeanor prosecutions within the city, are definitive and declaratory of the duties of the city attorney but are not limitations on the constitutional power of the municipal court. That court derives its power from section 11, article VI of the Constitution of California (an amendment adopted in 1924), which provides in part that Ã¢ÂÂIn any . . . city which is governed under a charter framed and adopted under the authority of this Constitution containing a population of more than forty thousand inhabitants ... a Municipal Court may be established as in this article provided, anything in this Constitution to the contrary notwithstanding. . . . Municipal Courts shall have original jurisdiction [see, also, sec. 13, hereinafter quoted in part] . . . in all criminal cases amounting to misdemeanor punishable by fine and imprisonment in the city or city and county or county jail, or punishable by fine or such imprisonment. . . . The Legislature shall provide by general law for the constitution, regulation, government and procedure of Municipal Courts, and for the jurisdiction thereof except in the particulars otherwise specified in this section, and for the establishment of Municipal Courts in cities or cities and counties governed under charters framed and adopted under the authority of this Constitution, and having the population hereinbefore in this section specified.Ã¢ÂÂ By amendment of section 13, article VI of the Constitution in the year 1928, the jurisdictional scheme and control of municipal courts was somewhat altered by the adoption of the provision that Ã¢ÂÂthe Legislature may fix by law the jurisdiction of Municipal CourtsÃ¢ÂÂ. That jurisdiction, as to offenses committed in cities having such courts, has been declared by the legislature, in section 1462 of the Penal Code, as follows: Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ Each municipal court shall have exclusive jurisdiction in all criminal cases amounting to misdemeanor, where the offense charged was committed within the city in which such municipal court is established except those of which the juvenile court is given jurisdictionÃ¢ÂÂ. Certainly the plain import of *Supp. 752the constitutional and statutory provisions quoted negatives any contention that either the jurisdiction of, or procedure in, municipal courts is a municipal, as distinguished from, a state affair.
To hold that the Los Angeles city charter provisions eliminate prosecutions, whether for violations of the city charter, city ordinances or state laws, unless the same are Ã¢ÂÂinstitutedÃ¢ÂÂ, and the complaints prepared and presented, by the city attorney, would give such charter provisions either the effect of regulating procedure in the municipal courts (requiring the dismissal of actions not so filed by the city attorney) or of ousting them from a part of the jurisdiction conferred by the Constitution and legislature. While the duties of a city prosecutor, in so far as violations of his cityÃ¢ÂÂs charter and ordinances are concerned, may be said to be a municipal affair (Fleming v. Hance, (1908) 153 Cal. 162, 169 [94 Pac. 620]), the procedure in, and jurisdiction of the municipal courts are by express constitutional provision, as we have noted above, matters of state rather than municipal concern. (Sec. 11, art. VI, Cal. Const.; see, also, Nicholl v. Koster, (1910) 157 Cal. 416, 419, 420 [108 Pac. 302].) The ordinance establishing the Los Angeles court expressly provides Ã¢ÂÂThat a municipal court in and for the city of Los Angeles is hereby created, constituted and established, under authority of, and in conformity with the Constitution and laws of the state of California and the charter of such city . . . [and] said municipal court shall . . . have and exercise such jurisdiction and powers as are now, or hereafter may be, provided by lawÃ¢ÂÂ. (Bancroft-Whitney Co. v. Payne, (1925) 197 Cal. 551, 554 [241 Pac. 551].) To interpret the charter provisions as limiting the jurisdiction of, or regulating procedure in, such courts would render such provisions void as obnoxious to general law in a field not constituting a municipal affair and already occupied exclusively by the state. Such a construction is to be avoided in favor of one reasonably tenable and giving the provisions a valid effect. Such a one is that hereinabove suggested, i. e., that they are definitive and declaratory of the duties of the city attorney but are not limitations on the constitutional power of the court.
The order appealed from is reversed and the cause is remanded to the municipal court, with directions to deny the motion to dismiss on the ground stated, and for further pro*Supp. 753eeedings pursuant to law and not inconsistent with this judg-ment.

Santaniello, J.
This ÃÂ¡ppeal arises out of the decision of the defendant zoning commission of the city of Norwalk (commission)1 granting the defendant Catherine Conte permission to build an eight unit conservation development on land located along Long Island Sound. The plaintiff, Joan McNally, who had been granted permission to intervene in the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs application, appealed the commissionÃ¢ÂÂs decision to the Superior Court.2 The court found in favor of the plaintiff. The defendant filed a petition for certification3 *3that the Appellate Court granted. We transferred the subsequent appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book ÃÂ§ 4023 and General Statutes ÃÂ§ 51-199 (c).
The defendant claims that the trial court improperly: (1) concluded that the plaintiff owned land within 100 feet of the land involved in the commissionÃ¢ÂÂs decision and, therefore, that the plaintiff was statutorily aggrieved pursuant to General Statutes ÃÂ§ 8-8 (a) (l);4 (2) decided zoning issues while General Statutes ÃÂ§ 22a-195 confers upon an intervenor standing to raise only environmental issues; (3) reversed the commissionÃ¢ÂÂs decision to allow soils below the high water mark to be used for the sole purpose of calculating upland density; and (4) ruled that the commission should have applied an amended version of ÃÂ§ 118-410 (C) (3) of the Norwalk zoning regulations6 to the application rather than the version in effect when the application was filed. We affirm.
The procedural background of the case is as follows. The defendant claims to own a 12.52 acre peninsula *4of land in Norwalk that is surrounded on three sides by Raymond Creek, also known as Half Mile Island Creek, a body of water connected to Long Island Sound.7 The plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs deed indicates that she owns property that abuts the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs property at the centerline of Half Mile Island Creek.
On July 21,1989, the defendant filed an application for a coastal site plan with the commission, and on September 25,1989, she requested a special permit. In the application, the defendant sought approval for an eight unit conservation development on her 12.52 acre parcel. The initial application stated that the property is bounded by Raymond Creek to the north, Half Mile Island Creek to the south and Canfield Avenue to the west. Of the 12.52 acres included in the application, 4.89 acres are located above the mean high water mark and 7.63 acres are tidal wetlands located below the mean high water mark. Although the plans indicated that all eight units would be located outside of the tidal wetlands, the entire 12.52 acres were used in calculating the housing density, pursuant to ÃÂ§ 118-410 (C) (3) of the Norwalk zoning regulations.
In October, 1989, pursuant to General Statutes ÃÂ§ 22a-109 (d), the commission submitted the plan to the state department of environmental protection (DEP) for comments. The commission first scheduled a public hearing on the application on October 18, 1989. After several postponements, the public hearing on the *5defendantÃ¢ÂÂs application began on February 21, 1990, and concluded on April 18, 1990. At the hearing, the plaintiff intervened in the administrative proceeding pursuant to General Statutes ÃÂ§ 22a-19. On August 15, 1990, the commission approved the application subject to seven conditions.8
The plaintiff then appealed to the Superior Court. The trial court sustained the plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs appeal concluding, inter alia, that: (1) the plaintiff was aggrieved and had standing to bring an appeal pursuant to both General Statutes ÃÂ§ÃÂ§ 8-8 (a) and 22a-19; (2) the defendant did not own the tidal wetlands below the mean high water mark and, therefore, the commission should not have included these wetlands in the calculation of upland density; (3) the commission improperly characterized the property as containing a body of water when, in fact, it bordered on Long Island Sound; and (4) the amended version of the regulation, not the regulation in effect when the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs application had been filed, applied to this case, and the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs property did not comply with the requirements of that amended regulation.
I
The defendant first claims that the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs finding with respect to aggrievement cannot stand. The defendant claims that the trial court was inconsistent in holding that the defendant did not own the soils below the mean high water mark, but that the plaintiff was statutorily aggrieved pursuant to ÃÂ§ 8-8 (a) (1) because her property was within 100 feet of the alleged boundary of the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs property that was located below the mean high water mark. Because aggrievement implicates the plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs standing to appeal, the *6first issue we address is aggrievement. Primerica v. Planning & Zoning Commission, 211 Conn. 85, 92, 558 A.2d 646 (1989). Unless the plaintiff alleges and proves aggrievement, her case must be dismissed. Smith v. Planning & Zoning Board, 203 Conn. 317, 321, 524 A.2d 1128 (1987). Only if the plaintiff has established aggrievement can the court proceed to consider the merits of her claim.
The plaintiff can demonstrate statutory aggrievement pursuant to ÃÂ§ 8-8 (a) (1) if she can demonstrate that her property abuts or is within 100 feet of Ã¢ÂÂany portion of the land involved in the decisionÃ¢ÂÂ of the commission. The deeds of the parties indicate that their properties abut at the centerline of Raymond Creek. Citing Simons v. French, 25 Conn. 346, 352 (1856), the plaintiff contends, however, that, despite what is recorded in her deed, the state owns all the land below the mean high water mark as a public trust for its citizens. See Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Mississippi, 484 U.S. 469, 108 S. Ct. 791, 98 L. Ed. 2d 877 (1988). The plaintiff claims that she is nonetheless statutorily aggrieved because the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs property as described in the application before the commission is within 100 feet of the mean high water mark on her property.
The defendant argues that if the land below the mean high water mark on the plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs property cannot be considered for the plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs aggrievement, then the land below the mean high water mark on the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs property should also not be considered. Because the shortest distance between the mean high water marks on the two properties is 142 feet, the defendant contends that the plaintiff is not statutorily aggrieved. The plaintiff, however, interprets the statutory language, Ã¢ÂÂland involved in the decision,Ã¢ÂÂ to mean the land described in the application, regardless of ownership, and maintains that she is statutorily aggrieved.
*7Both parties rely on Caltabiano v. Planning & Zoning Commission, 211 Conn. 662, 560 A.2d 975 (1989), to support their positions. In Caltabiano, the applicant had sought a special exception for a Ã¢ÂÂ3.8 acre parcel located deep within [a] 110 acre parcel.Ã¢ÂÂ Id., 664. The plaintiffs, whose property either abutted or was within 100 feet of the 110 acre parcel, claimed that they were statutorily aggrieved. Id., 664-65. We interpreted the phrase Ã¢ÂÂland involvedÃ¢ÂÂ to be the complete tract of land owned by the applicant, not the portion of the land containing the proposed activity. Id., 663. In reaching this conclusion, we examined the legislative intent in creating statutory aggrievement. Ã¢ÂÂWe conclude that the legislature presumed as a matter of common knowledge that persons owning property within close proximity to a projected zoning action would be sufficiently affected by the decision of a zoning agency to be entitled to appeal that decision to the court. Giving such a right to the narrow class of abutters and those owning property within 100 feet of the land involved would not unduly enlarge the class of those entitled to appeal such a decision.Ã¢ÂÂ Id., 668-69. To consider only those persons within 100 feet of the actual site of the proposed activity to be statutorily aggrieved is a restrictive interpretation of the statutory language. Ã¢ÂÂTo apply ÃÂ§ 8-8 (a) in such a narrow fashion would be to nullify its effect of opening up the courts to litigants with a presumptively legitimate right to challenge such zoning decisions.Ã¢ÂÂ Id., 669-70.
Ã¢ÂÂAggrievement presents a question of fact for the trial court.Ã¢ÂÂ Fuller v. Planning & Zoning Commission, 21 Conn. App. 340, 343, 573 A.2d 1222 (1990), citing Bakelaar v. West Haven, 193 Conn. 59, 65, 475 A.2d 283 (1984). Ã¢ÂÂIt is well established that an appellate court will not retry the facts. Our review is to determine whether the judgment of the trial court was clearly erroneous or contrary to the law.Ã¢ÂÂ Fuller v. Planning *8& Zoning Commission, supra, 344. Ã¢ÂÂThe conclusion reached by the court cannot be disturbed on appeal unless the subordinate facts found do not support it.Ã¢ÂÂ Fletcher v. Planning & Zoning Commission, 158 Conn. 497, 503, 264 A.2d 566 (1969).
The trial court held that Ã¢ÂÂ[u]nder the facts of this case, the phrase Ã¢ÂÂland involved in the decisionÃ¢ÂÂ should be read to mean the land claimed to be owned by the applicant, accepted by the commission as owned by the applicant, and on which the commission based the substance of its decision. In this case, that land is the 12.52 acre parcel [the defendant] claims to own.Ã¢ÂÂ Because the trial court found that the plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs land is within 100 feet of the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs parcel, it found that the plaintiff is statutorily aggrieved. We agree with the trial court. To hold otherwise would be contrary to the legislative purpose of ÃÂ§ 8-8 (a). Under the facts of this case, a contrary construction would prevent neighboring landowners from appealing the commissionÃ¢ÂÂs decision and challenging the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs claim of ownership of the lands below the mean high water mark.
Because we conclude that the plaintiff established statutory aggrievement by showing that her property is within 100 feet of the property described in the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs application, it is unnecessary to decide whether the plaintiff was also aggrieved pursuant to S 22a-19.
II
The defendant also claims that the trial court improperly applied the amended version of ÃÂ§ 118-410 (C) of the Norwalk zoning regulations that was in effect at the time the court reviewed the commissionÃ¢ÂÂs decision, rather than the version in effect when the application was fled. It is undisputed that the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs application did not comply with the amended version of the regulations.
*9The rule followed in Connecticut at the time the defendant filed her application was that the zoning law or regulation in effect at the time the court rendered its decision controlled the outcome. McCallum v. Inland Wetlands Commission, 196 Conn. 218, 223, 492 A.2d 508 (1985); A.D.AM. Land Development Corporation v. Conservation Commission, 21 Conn. App. 122, 130, 572 A.2d 364 (1990). The purpose for this rule was to avoid having zoning disputes settled on the basis of outdated rules. East Lyme v. Waddington, 4 Conn. App. 252, 259, 493 A.2d 903, cert. denied, 197 Conn. 811, 499 A.2d 61 (1985).
Public Acts 1989, No. 89-311 changed this rule. Under that act, an application must be granted if it complied with the regulations in effect at the time the application was filed.9 This act became effective, however, on October 1,1989. The defendant filed her application on July 21, 1989, and her request for a special permit on September 25, 1989. Because Public Acts 1989, No. 89-311 was a new enactment, it must be applied prospectively. A.D.A.M. Land Development Corporation v. Conservation Commission, supra, 130 n.7; see Darak v. Darak, 210 Conn. 462, 473, 556 A.2d 145 (1989). A statute should not be applied retroactively to pending actions unless the legislature clearly expressed an intent that it should be so applied. New Haven v. Public Utilities Commission, 165 Conn. 687, 726, 345 A.2d 563 (1974).
The defendantÃ¢ÂÂs application was filed before the act became effective. The act does not indicate by its language that it should be applied to pending applications. *10Therefore, as a new regulation, the act should not be applied retroactively to the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs application. The trial court properly applied the amended version of the regulation in its review of the commissionÃ¢ÂÂs decision, as it was required to do by our decision in McCallum v. Inland Wetlands Commission, supra. Because the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs application unquestionably fails to comply with the amended version of the regulation, the trial court properly sustained the plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs administrative appeal.10
The judgment is affirmed.
In this opinion the other justices concurred.

 Although the commission is the named defendant, it has not participated in this appeal. References to the defendant are to Catherine Conte.


 General Statutes ÃÂ§ 8-8 (b) provides in pertinent part: Ã¢ÂÂ[A]ny person aggrieved by any decision of a board may take an appeal to the superior court . . . .Ã¢ÂÂ


 General Statutes ÃÂ§ 8-8 (o) provides in pertinent part: Ã¢ÂÂThere shall be no right to further review except to the appellate court by certification for review . . . .Ã¢ÂÂ


 General Statutes ÃÂ§ 8-8 (a) (1) provides in pertinent part: Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂAggrieved personÃ¢ÂÂ means a person aggrieved by a decision of a board . . . . In the case of a decision by a zoning commission . . . Ã¢ÂÂaggrieved personÃ¢ÂÂ includes any person owning land that abuts or is within a radius of one hundred feet of any portion of the land involved in the decision of the board.Ã¢ÂÂ


 General Statutes ÃÂ§ 22a-19 (a) provides in pertinent part: Ã¢ÂÂIn any administrative, licensing or other proceeding, and in any judicial review thereof made available by law . . . any person . . . may intervene as a party on the filing of a verified pleading asserting that the proceeding or action for judicial review involves conduct which has, or which is reasonably likely to have, the effect of unreasonably polluting, impairing or destroying the public trust in the air, water or other natural resources of the state.Ã¢ÂÂ


 At the time of the filing of the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs application, ÃÂ§ 118-410 (C) (3) of the Norwalk zoning regulations provided in pertinent part: Ã¢ÂÂThe maximum number of dwellings permitted in a conservation development shall be determined by dividing the total acreage of the parcel by the minimum lot size permitted in the zone and multiplying the result by ninety hundredths (.90)----
Ã¢ÂÂ(a) Parcels which contain a body of water, a designated inland wetland or watercourse or tidal wetland shall include only fifty percent (50%) of *4said body of water or designated wetland area in arriving at the maximum number of dwelling units permitted above. . . .Ã¢ÂÂ
On February 21, 1990, the commission amended this regulation, effective March 2,1990, to reduce the first factor from ninety hundredths (.90) to eighty-five hundredths (.85), and the second factor from 50 percent to 33.3 percent.


 The defendantÃ¢ÂÂs deed describes the property as extending to the centerline of Raymond Creek, following that centerline northeasterly for 185 feet and continuing to follow the centerline through the twists and turns of the creek.


 These conditions related to issues of concern raised by the DEP. At the time the commission approved the application, these concerns remained unresolved.


 Public Acts 1989, No. 89-311 provides in pertinent part: Ã¢ÂÂAn application filed with a zoning commission ... of a town . . . which is in conformance with the applicable zoning regulations as of the time of filing shall not be required to comply with, nor shall it be disapproved for the reason that it does not comply with, any change in the zoning regulations . . . taking effect after the filing of such application.Ã¢ÂÂ


 In her third claim on appeal, the defendant argues that the trial court improperly reversed the commissionÃ¢ÂÂs decision to apply ÃÂ§ 118-410 (C) (3) of the Norwalk zoning regulations to allow soils below the high water mark to be used to calculate upland density. This claim is rendered moot by our decision that the trial court properly applied the version of the regulation in effect when it reviewed the commissionÃ¢ÂÂs decision on the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs application.

The sole issue in this appeal is whether service of an administrative appeal by certified mail pursuant to General Statutes ÃÂ§ 4-183 (c) (l)1 of the Uni*15form Administrative Procedure Act (UAPA) requires a citation. The plaintiff, Angelita Tolly, appealed to the Superior Court from a decision of the defendant, the department of human resources, revoking her family day care home registration. The trial court granted the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs motion to dismiss the administrative appeal because the appeal lacked a citation.
The Appellate Court affirmed the judgment of dismissal in a per curiam decision; Tolly v. Department of Human Resources, 26 Conn. App. 938, 600 A.2d 1390 (1992); deeming the issue controlled by its three prior decisions: Shapiro v. Carothers, 23 Conn. App. 188, 579 A.2d 583 (1990); Senie v. Carothers, 22 Conn. App. 253, 576 A.2d 1312 (1990); and DelVecchio v. Department of Income Maintenance, 18 Conn. App. 13, 555 A.2d 1007 (1989). We granted certification to appeal on the following issue: Ã¢ÂÂDid the Appellate Court correctly affirm the judgment of the Superior Court dismissing a petition for administrative appeal that was properly served on all necessary parties by United States certified mail as expressly permitted by Connecticut General Statutes ÃÂ§ 4-183 (c) (1), for the stated reason that no citation form was appended to the petition?Ã¢ÂÂ Tolly v. Department of Human Resources, 221 Conn. 922, 608 A.2d 687 (1992). We now reverse.
The facts are undisputed. On December 7,1990, the defendant issued a final decision revoking the plaintiffs family day care home registration. On January 17, 1991, the plaintiff filed in the trial court an administrative appeal challenging the validity of that decision. The administrative appeal identified the plaintiff and *16the defendant, the specific judicial district and location of the court, the return date, and the date and nature of the decision from which the plaintiff appealed.2 It did not contain a citation, or any language approximating a citation. Attached to the appeal was a certification executed by the plaintiffs counsel indicating that she had served the appeal by certified mail on twelve named persons, including the commissioner of human resources and the attorney general. On January 31, 1991, the plaintiffs counsel filed an Ã¢ÂÂAffidavit Regarding Service of Administrative Appeal Dated Janu*17ary 16,1991,Ã¢ÂÂ indicating that she had mailed, by postage prepaid certified mail, return receipt requested, a copy of the appeal to the twelve named persons, and attaching their return receipts dated January 17,1991.
On February 20, 1991, the defendant moved to dismiss the appeal, asserting that Ã¢ÂÂ[t]he court has no subject matter jurisdiction because the plaintiff failed to include a citation in her appeal.Ã¢ÂÂ The trial court granted the motion on the authority of the Appellate CourtÃ¢ÂÂs decision in Senie v. Carothers, supra. This appeal followed.
The plaintiff raises several claims on appeal, all of which, however, distill into the fundamental claim that proper service of an appeal pursuant to ÃÂ§ 4-183 (c) (1) does not require a citation. We agree.
Both the plaintiff and the defendant agree, as do we, that whether service of process by certified mail pursuant to ÃÂ§ 4-183 (c) (1) requires a citation is a matter of statutory construction. Thus, it is not persuasive that, as the plaintiff suggests, Practice Book ÃÂ§ 49 provides that the judicial department form for a summons in a civil action Ã¢ÂÂshall not be used in . . . [administrative appeals.Ã¢ÂÂ3 Nor is it persuasive that, as the *18defendant points out, Practice Book ÃÂ§ 256 provides that, Ã¢ÂÂ[f]or purposes of these rules, administrative appeals are civil actions.Ã¢ÂÂ4
Ã¢ÂÂIn administrative appeals, the citation is the writ of summons that directs the sheriff or some other proper officer to seek out the defendant agency and to summon it to a particular sitting of a particular court on a specified day. 1E. Stephenson, Connecticut Civil Procedure (2d Ed. 1970) ÃÂ§ 18. The citation, signed by competent authority, is the warrant which bestows upon the officer to whom it is given for service the power and authority to execute its command.Ã¢ÂÂ (Internal quotation marks omitted.) McQuillan v. Department of Liquor Control, 216 Conn. 667, 671, 583 A.2d 633 (1990); see also Hillman v. Greenwich, 217 Conn. 520, 525, 587 A.2d 99 (1991) (citation is command to duly *19authorized officer to summon defendant to appear in court on specific day to answer complaint); Sheehan v. Zoning Commission, 173 Conn. 408, 413, 378 A.2d 519 (1977) (citation is direction to officer to summon agency whose decision is being appealed). A proper citation, therefore, requires not only the signature of a competent authority, such as a commissioner of the Superior Court, but the direction to a competent authority, such as a sheriff, constable or indifferent person, to summon the defendant to appear in court. 1 E. Stephenson, supra.
With this background in mind, we turn to the question of whether ÃÂ§ 4-183 (c) (1) requires a citation. Considering the text of ÃÂ§ 4-183 (c) (1), in the context of the statute as a whole, its purpose and its legislative history, we conclude that service of process pursuant to ÃÂ§ 4-183 (c) (1) does not require a citation.
Section 4-183 (c) (1) provides: Ã¢ÂÂService of the [administrative] appeal shall be made by (1) United States mail, certified or registered, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, without the use of a sheriff or other officer.Ã¢ÂÂ There is nothing in this plain language that suggests the need for anything more than mailing copies of the appeal in the specified manner, as the plaintiff did in this case. The text does not, either directly or by way of implication, provide for a citation.
Furthermore, reading the statute as a whole reinforces the conclusion that no citation is required for service pursuant to ÃÂ§ 4-183 (c) (1), in contrast to service pursuant to ÃÂ§ 4-183 (c) (2). See footnote 1. Section 4-183 (c) provides, in general terms, that an administrative appeal must, within forty-five days of delivery of the final decision to the person appealing, be filed with the court, and served on the agency or the attorney general and on each party listed in the decision. It further provides that such service shall be made by *20one of two alternative methods: Ã¢ÂÂby (1) United States mail, certified or registered, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, without the use of a sheriff or other officer, or (2) personal service by a proper officer or indifferent person making service in the same manner as complaints are served in ordinary civil actions.Ã¢ÂÂ
Personal service pursuant to ÃÂ§ 4-183 (c) (2) requires, by clear implication, a citation commanding the Ã¢ÂÂproper officer or indifferent personÃ¢ÂÂ to make service Ã¢ÂÂin the same manner as complaints are served in ordinary civil actions.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂThe citation that is used to commence an administrative appeal is analogous to the writ used to commence a civil action.Ã¢ÂÂ Brunswick v. Inland Wetlands Commission, 222 Conn. 541, 542 n.l, 610 A.2d 1260 (1992). The process of serving a complaint in an ordinary civil action requires the use of a writ of summons directed to a sheriff or other authority competent to make service of process. See General Statutes ÃÂ§ÃÂ§ 52-45a and 52-45b. Indeed, personal service by such an authority without a writ of summons has long been regarded as a nullity, because without such a writ the sheriff is no more than a delivery person. Hillman v. Greenwich, supra, 525.
The service required by ÃÂ§ 4-183 (c) (2) stands in marked contrast to service pursuant to ÃÂ§ 4-183 (c) (1), which specifically provides that service by certified or registered mail may be Ã¢ÂÂwithout the use of a sheriff or other officer.Ã¢ÂÂ That contrast underscores the difference between service made pursuant to the two different statutory methods. Whereas service pursuant to ÃÂ§ 4-183 (c) (2) requires an authority competent to make service and, therefore, a citation, service pursuant to ÃÂ§ 4-183 (c) (1), by specifically eliminating the intervention of a Ã¢ÂÂsheriff or other officerÃ¢ÂÂ for purposes of service, also eliminates the necessity of a citation. Indeed, because a citation requires, not only a competent signing authority, but a command by that signing author*21ity to a competent serving authority, and because under ÃÂ§ 4-183 (c) (1) no Ã¢ÂÂsheriff or other officerÃ¢ÂÂ is required, it is difficult to conceive what the language of a proper citation would be under ÃÂ§ 4-183 (c) (l).* ***5 Absent a Ã¢ÂÂsheriff or other officerÃ¢ÂÂ to receive such a command, a citation would be meaningless. We do not ascribe to the legislature the intent to require the performance of a meaningless act. See, e.g., Atwood v. Regional School District No. 15, 169 Conn. 613, 621, 363 A.2d 1038 (1975).
The conclusion that ÃÂ§ 4-183 (c) (1) does not require a citation is buttressed by reference to ÃÂ§ 4-183 (d).6 That subsection provides that a record of proper service be timely filed with the clerk of the court in either of two ways: (1) by the filing of Ã¢ÂÂthe sheriffs returnÃ¢ÂÂ; or (2) by the appellantÃ¢ÂÂs filing Ã¢ÂÂan affidavit . . . stating the date and manner in which a copy of the appeal was served on each party and on the agency that rendered the final decision . . . .Ã¢ÂÂ This latter method of evidencing service of process indicates a legislative awareness that, as in this case, there are instances in which no serving officer, and therefore no citation, is necessary because the appealing party herself effected service pursuant to ÃÂ§ 4-183 (c) (1).
*22The legislative history of ÃÂ§ 4-183 (c) (1) further supports our conclusion. As originally enacted in 1971, ÃÂ§ 4-183 (b) simply provided that Ã¢ÂÂ[c]opies of the petition [for review] shall be served upon the agency and all parties of record.Ã¢ÂÂ Public Acts 1971, No. 854, ÃÂ§ 18. In 1977, this subsection was amended to provide that the petition for review Ã¢ÂÂshall be served upon the agency and all parties of record in the same manner as process is served in civil actions.Ã¢ÂÂ (Emphasis added.) Public Acts 1977, No. 77-603, ÃÂ§ 1. Under that provision, the statute plainly required service by a sheriff or other proper authority and, therefore, a citation.
In 1979, the legislature further amended ÃÂ§ 4-183 (b) by eliminating the language, Ã¢ÂÂin the same manner as process is served in civil actions,Ã¢ÂÂ and by adding a method of service on the agency by certified or registered mail. Public Acts 1979, No. 79-163. As a result of that legislation, subsection (b) provided in part: Ã¢ÂÂCopies of the petition shall be served upon the agency and all parties of record within thirty days after mailing of such notice or, if a rehearing is requested, thirty days after the decision thereon, except that service upon an agency may be made by mailing a copy of the petition by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, to the office of the commissioner of the agency or to the office of the attorney general in Hartford. Ã¢ÂÂ (Emphasis added.) General Statutes (Rev. to 1981) ÃÂ§ 4-183 (b). Accordingly, service of process on the agency, but not on other parties to the appeal, was then permissible by certified or registered mail.
In 1984, however, the legislature further amended ÃÂ§ 4-183 (b) specifically to provide that the certified or registered mail could be Ã¢ÂÂwithout the use of a sheriff or other officer.Ã¢ÂÂ Public Acts 1984, No. 84-43, ÃÂ§ 1. After that amendment, therefore, subsection (b) provided in part: Ã¢ÂÂCopies of the petition shall be served upon the agency and all parties of record within thirty days after *23mailing of such notice [of the final decision] or, if a rehearing is requested, within thirty days after mailing of the notice of the decision thereon, except that service upon an agency may be made by the appellant mailing a copy of the petition by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, without the use of a sheriff or other officer, to the office of the commissioner of the agency or to the office of the attorney general in Hartford.Ã¢ÂÂ (Emphasis added.) General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) ÃÂ§ 4-183 (b).
The legislative history of this amendment makes clear that it was proposed and adopted in response to a decision of the Appellate Session of the Superior Court; Board of Education v. State Board of Education, 38 Conn. Sup. 712, 461 A.2d 977 (1983); that apparently was understood to hold that even the registered or certified mail service provided by the 1979 legislation required the intervention of a sheriff or other officer. In testimony before the Joint Standing Committee on the Judiciary, Attorney Raphael L. Podolsky explained that House Bill No. 5595, which later became the 1979 public act, was intended (1) to eliminate the need for a sheriff and a citation when service by registered or certified mail was being made on the agency, and (2) to clarify that this had been the original intent of the 1979 legislation.7 This explanation was echoed on the floor *24of the legislature.8 These explanations of legislative intent are, moreover, fully consistent with the language of the 1984 statutory amendment.
The language of General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) ÃÂ§ 4-183 (b) remained the same until 1988. By virtue of Public Acts 1988, No. 88-317, ÃÂ§23, ÃÂ§4-183 was amended to provide for the two alternative forms of *25service now contained in ÃÂ§ 4-183 (c) (1) and (2). See footnote 1. Significantly, that amendment did not alter the preexisting provision regarding service by certified or registered mail Ã¢ÂÂwithout the use of a sheriff or other officer,Ã¢ÂÂ except to eliminate the previous limitation thereon to service by mail on the agency. Therefore, since 1988 mail service pursuant to ÃÂ§ 4-183 (c) (1), without the necessity of a sheriff or citation, has been permissible with respect to all defendants.
The defendant argues that the service of process in this case was fatally flawed, nonetheless, because, although the petition referred to a return day, it contained no specific language ordering the defendant to appear on or before the second day after the return day. Therefore, the defendant contends that: (1) the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over this statutory appeal; or (2) in the alternative, this defect deprived the court of personal jurisdiction over the defendant. Consequently, the defendant argues, its timely motion pursuant to Practice Book ÃÂ§ 1429 warranted dismissal on that basis. We disagree.
Prior to the 1988 amendment to the UAPA, under the case law regarding administrative appealsÃ¢ÂÂat least those appeals served by a sheriff, and not by certified mailÃ¢ÂÂthe defendant might have prevailed on this argument. See, e.g., Chestnut Realty, Inc. v. Commission on Human Rights & Opportunities, 201 Conn. 350, 356-57, 514 A.2d 749 (1986) (use of improper citation form to commence administrative appeal not fatal to appeal, so long as form gives notice, inter alia, of return *26day and of Ã¢ÂÂthe requirement for filing an appearanceÃ¢ÂÂ). We are convinced, however, that the 1988 amendment to the UAPA requires a different result in this case.
In 1988, the legislature enacted a comprehensive revision of the UAPA, based upon recommendations made after nearly three years of study and review by the Connecticut law revision commission. See 31 H.R. Proc., Pt. 21,1988 Sess., p. 7320, remarks of Representative Martin Looney; Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Judiciary, Pt. 1, 1988 Sess., p. 185, remarks of David Biklen, executive director of the Connecticut law revision commission; 1987 Thirteenth Annual Report of the Connecticut Law Revision Commission to the General Assembly, March, 1988, p. 31 (Law Revision Commission Report). One of the proposals of the law revision commission involved service of an appeal under ÃÂ§ 4-183. That proposal, with minor changes, became what is now ÃÂ§ 4-183 (c) and (d). See footnote 1; Public Acts 1988, No. 88-317, ÃÂ§ 23; Law Revision Commission Report, supra, p. 63.
Section 4-183 (c) provides, in pertinent part, that the party appealing must, within forty-five days of delivery of the agency decision, Ã¢ÂÂserve a copy of the appealÃ¢ÂÂ on the agency at its office or the office of the attorney general. It also provides: Ã¢ÂÂWithin that [forty-five day] time [period], the person appealing shall also serve a copy of the appeal on each party listed in the final decision at the address shown in the decision, provided failure to make such service within forty-five days on parties other than the agency that rendered the final decision shall not deprive the court of jurisdiction over the appeal. Service of the appeal shall be made by (1) United States mail, certified or registered, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, without the use of a sheriff or other officer, or (2) personal service by a proper officer or indifferent person making service in the same manner as complaints are served in ordinary *27civil actions.Ã¢ÂÂ (Emphasis added.) Section 4-183 (d) provides in pertinent part: Ã¢ÂÂIf the failure to make service causes prejudice to any party to the appeal or to the agency, the court, after hearing, may dismiss the appeal. Ã¢ÂÂ (Emphasis added.)
These two provisions, emphasized above, appear to conflict with respect to the effect of a failure to make service on the agency. The language of ÃÂ§ 4-183 (c), that a Ã¢ÂÂfailure to make such service within forty-five days on parties other than the agency . . . shall not deprive the court of jurisdiction over the appeal,Ã¢ÂÂ implies that a failure to make such service on the agency will deprive the court of Ã¢ÂÂjurisdiction over the appeal,Ã¢ÂÂ namely, subject matter jurisdiction. This principle would be consistent with the long-standing, preexisting law that, Ã¢ÂÂ[b]ecause the right to take an administrative appeal depends upon statutory authority . . . noncompliance with the statutory requirements of the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act implicates subject matter jurisdiction and renders a nonconforming appeal subject to dismissal. Tarnopol v. Connecticut Siting Council, 212 Conn. 157, 163, 561 A.2d 931 (1989); Hillcroft Partners v. Commission on Human Rights & Opportunities, 205 Conn. 324, 326-27, 533 A.2d 852 (1987); Chestnut Realty, Inc. v. Commission on Human Rights & Opportunities, [supra, 356]; Basilicato v. Department of Public Utility Control, 197 Conn. 320, 324, 497 A.2d 48 (1985).Ã¢ÂÂ McQuillan v. Department of Liquor Control, supra, 670.
The text of ÃÂ§ 4-183 (d) provides, however, that Ã¢ÂÂ[i]f the failure to make service causes prejudice ... to the agency, the court, after hearing, may dismiss the appeal.Ã¢ÂÂ This language provides that even a timely motion to dismiss will not automatically lead to dismissal; dismissal follows only if the court, after hearing, finds that prejudice resulted from the failure to make service. Section 4-183 (d) implies, therefore, that *28such a failure is not a matter of subject matter jurisdiction, because dismissal based only on a finding of prejudice is inconsistent with the established notion that lack of subject matter jurisdiction requires dismissal, regardless of such factors as prejudice, waiver or consent. See, e.g., United States Trust Co. v. Bohart, 197 Conn. 34, 39, 495 A.2d 1034 (1985).
Statutes should be read so as to harmonize with each other, and not to conflict with each other. See, e.g., Red Rooster v. River Associates, Inc., 224 Conn. 563, 570, 620 A.2d 118 (1993). We resolve the apparent conflict between ÃÂ§ 4-183 (c) and (d) by focusing on the language in ÃÂ§ 4-183 (c) requiring service on the agency Ã¢ÂÂ[wjithin forty-five days.Ã¢ÂÂ We read that sentence as imposing a time limitation with respect to subject matter jurisdiction. If there is no service at all on the agency within the forty-five day period, the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the appeal by virtue of the clear implication of the language in ÃÂ§ 4-183 (c), read against the background of the preexisting law. This reading of ÃÂ§ 4-183 (c) is consistent with the recognition that Ã¢ÂÂ[tjime limitations for taking appeals do not exist merely for the convenience of the parties but involve a strong public interest in the finality of legal proceedings. For this reason they have generally been regarded as jurisdictional.Ã¢ÂÂ Farricielli v. Personnel Appeal Board, 186 Conn. 198, 208, 440 A.2d 286 (1982) (Shea, J., dissenting).
If, however, as in this case, there is an arguable defect in the process that was timely served on the agencyÃ¢ÂÂ namely, a lack of specific language in the appeal directing the defendant to file an appearance on or before the second day after the return dayÃ¢ÂÂrather than a failure to make service at all within the applicable time period, the court does not lack subject matter jurisdiction over the appeal. Under those circumstances, ÃÂ§ 4-183 (d) applies, and the appeal is dismissable only *29upon a finding of prejudice to the agency. In this case, the defendant does not claim any prejudice, and it would be difficult to perceive any, because presumably the attorney general knew the significance of a return day stated on an administrative appeal.
The conclusion that the subject matter jurisdiction of the court is implicated only if there is a total failure to serve the agency within the statutory forty-five day period, and not if there is merely a defect in the document timely served on the agency, is also consistent with our established jurisprudence regarding subject matter jurisdiction. Ã¢ÂÂSubject matter jurisdiction is the power of the court to hear and determine cases of the general class to which the proceedings in question belong. LeConche v. Elligers, 215 Conn. 701, 709, 579 A.2d 1 (1990), quoting Shea v. First Federal Savings & Loan Assn. of New Haven, 184 Conn. 285, 288, 439 A.2d 997 (1981).Ã¢ÂÂ (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Lauer v. Zoning Commission, 220 Conn. 455, 460, 600 A.2d 310 (1991). The determination of whether a statutory requirement implicates the subject matter jurisdiction of the court Ã¢ÂÂmust be informed by the established principle that every presumption is to be indulged in favor of jurisdiction.Ã¢ÂÂ (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. That presumption counsels that, in resolving the apparent conflict between ÃÂ§ 4-183 (c) and (d), we construe the subject matter jurisdictional implications of ÃÂ§ 4-183 (c) narrowly. See Brunswick v. Inland Wetlands Commission, supra (improperly executed citation does not affect subject matter jurisdiction of court).
The legislative history of No. 88-317 of the 1988 Public Acts supports this interpretation. That history reflects a general intent to modify the prior law so as to simplify and make more fair the process of appeal*30ing an agency decision under the UAPA.10 That intent would not be furthered by an interpretation of the UAPA that would render an appeal served by certified mail pursuant to the plain language of ÃÂ§ 4-183 (c) (1) subject to dismissal solely because the appeal failed to notify the attorney general of the necessity of filing a timely appearance.
*31The defendant argues that this court Ã¢ÂÂhas stated unwaveringly that the essentials of a citation must be included in an administrative appeal,Ã¢ÂÂ citing McQuillan v. Department of Liquor Control, supra, Chestnut Realty, Inc. v. Commission on Human Rights & Opportunities, supra, and Village Creek Homeowners Assn. v. Public Utilities Commission, 148 Conn. 336, 170 A.2d 732 (1961). Those cases are not dispositive. First, in none of those cases was service made by certified mail pursuant to ÃÂ§ 4-183 (c) (1). In all of those cases, service was made by a sheriff or other officer, who required a citation for his authority to make service. Second, in none of those cases were we interpreting ÃÂ§ 4-183 (c) and (d), in the light of the comprehensive revision of the UAPA enacted by the legislature in 1988.
The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed and the case is remanded to that court with direction to reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the case to that court with direction to deny the motion to dismiss, and for further proceedings according to law.
In this opinion the other justices concurred.

 General Statutes ÃÂ§ 4-183 provides in relevant part: Ã¢ÂÂAPPEAL TO supeBIOE COUET. (a) A person who has exhausted all administrative remedies available within the agency and who is aggrieved by a final decision may appeal to the superior court as provided in this section. The filing of a petition for reconsideration is not a prerequisite to the filing of such an appeal.
Ã¢ÂÂ(b) A person may appeal a preliminary, procedural or intermediate agency action or ruling to the superior court if (1) it appears likely that the person will otherwise qualify under this chapter to appeal from the final agency action or ruling and (2) postponement of the appeal would result in an inadequate remedy.
Ã¢ÂÂ(c) Within forty-five days after mailing of the final decision under section 4-180 or, if there is no mailing, within forty-five days after personal delivery of the final decision under said section, a person appealing as provided in this section shall serve a copy of the appeal on the agency that rendered the final decision at its office or at the office of the attorney general in Hartford and file the appeal with the clerk of the superior court for the judicial district of Hartford-New Britain or for the judicial district wherein the person appealing resides or, if that person is not a resident of this state, with the clerk of the court for the judicial district of Hartford-New Britain. Within that time, the person appealing shall also serve a copy of the appeal on each party listed in the final decision at the address shown in the decision, provided failure to make such service within forty-five days on parties other than the agency that rendered the final decision shall not *15deprive the court of jurisdiction over the appeal. Service of the appeal shall be made by (1) United States mail, certified or registered, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, without the use of a sheriff or other officer, or (2) personal service by a proper officer or indifferent person making service in the same manner as complaints are served in ordinary civil actions.Ã¢ÂÂ (Emphasis added.)

 At the time of the plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs filing of her administrative appeal, Practice Book ÃÂ§ 49 provided: Ã¢ÂÂmesne process
Ã¢ÂÂMesne process in civil actions shall be a writ of summons or attachment, describing the parties, the court to which it is returnable and the time and place of appearance, and shall be accompanied by the plaintiffs complaint. Such writ may run into any judicial district or geographical area and shall be signed by a commissioner of the superior court or a judge or clerk of the court to which it is returnable. Except in those actions and proceedings indicated below, the writ of summons shall be on a form substantially in compliance with Form 503.1 (JD-FM-3) in family actions and with Form 103.1 (JD-CV-1) in other civil actions. If any person is proceeding without the assistance of counsel, he shall sign the complaint and present the complaint and proposed writ of summons to the clerk; the clerk shall review the proposed writ of summons and, unless it is defective as to form or does not contain a bond for prosecution pursuant to Sec. 51, shall sign it.
Ã¢ÂÂForm 503.1 (JD-FM-3) and Form 103.1 (JD-CV-1) shall not be used in *18the following actions and proceedings which are commenced after the effective date of this amendment (January 16, 1978):
(1) Applications for change of name.
(2) Proceedings pertaining to arbitration.
(3) Probate appeals.
(4) Administrative appeals.
(5) Juvenile court appeals.
(6) Verified petitions for paternity.
(7) Verified petitions for support orders.
(8) Any actions or proceedings in which an attachment, garnishment or replevy is sought.
Ã¢ÂÂA plaintiff may, before service on a defendant, alter printed forms JD-FM-3 and JD-CV-1 in order to make them conform to any amendments to Practice Book Forms 503.1 or 103.1 or to any relevant amendments to Practice Book rules.Ã¢ÂÂ


 Practice Book ÃÂ§ 256 provides: Ã¢ÂÂadministrative appeals are civil actions
Ã¢ÂÂFor purposes of these rules, administrative appeals are civil actions. Whenever these rules refer to civil actions, actions, civil causes, causes or cases, the reference shall include administrative appeals except that (a) appeals from judgments of the superior court in administrative appeals shall be by certification only as provided by Gen. Stat., ÃÂ§ 51-197b as amended, and by chapter 55 of these rules; and (b) an administrative appeal shall not be deemed an action for purposes of Gen. Stat., ÃÂ§ ÃÂ§ 52-591, 52-592 or 52-593.Ã¢ÂÂ


 The defendant suggests that the language Ã¢ÂÂsheriff or other officerÃ¢ÂÂ does not include service by an indifferent person and that, therefore, a citation under General Statutes ÃÂ§ 4-183 (c) (1) would command such a person to make service of process by certified or registered mail. We do not believe, however, that by amending ÃÂ§ 4-183 to eliminate the necessity of service by a Ã¢ÂÂsheriff or other officerÃ¢ÂÂ; see infra; the legislature intended nevertheless to retain such a slender remnant of the prior practice.


 General Statutes ÃÂ§ 4-183 (d) provides: Ã¢ÂÂThe person appealing, not later than fifteen days after filing the appeal, shall file or cause to be filed with the clerk of the court an affidavit, or the sheriffs return, stating the date and manner in which a copy of the appeal was served on each party and on the agency that rendered the final decision, and, if service was not made on a party, the reason for failure to make service. If the failure to make service causes prejudice to any party to the appeal or to the agency, the court, after hearing, may dismiss the appeal.Ã¢ÂÂ


 Attorney Raphael L. Podolsky testified: Ã¢ÂÂThe third one I want to address is House Bill No. 5595 which is an act concerning the service of process in appeals of administrative agency decisions. This is a bill basically to correct what I believe to be an erroneous appellate session decision, interpreting a statute you passed in 1979 to accomplish a particular purpose.
Ã¢ÂÂPrior to 1977, there were different procedures for taking appeals from different administrative agencies, and some of them when you took the appeal, you could serve the agency by mail. You basically sent [a] certified letter to the commissioner. In others, you have to have the sheriff serve. In 1977, the General Assembly attempted to make these procedures uniform and the law that they passed required sheriff service in all cases. It wasnÃ¢ÂÂt really noticed at the time that this changed the process, for example, serving welfare appeals. In 1979, the legislature looked at that and *24decided it had made the wrong decision. That is to say, the simpler and more efficient way was that when youÃ¢ÂÂre serving the agency you could serve the agency by certified mail, and you do it yourself, you donÃ¢ÂÂt have to pay sheriff fees for that. And the bill was adopted and thatÃ¢ÂÂs basically what it says. If you examine the legislative history from 1979, there is no question that the intention was to dispense with the sheriff in those cases.
Ã¢ÂÂThere are at least two superior court cases that I know of in which that interpretation was confirmed. In 1983 in the case of Board of Education of the City of New Britain v. Connecticut State Board of Education, which is reported at 38 Conn. Supp. 712, [461 A.2d 997 (1983),] the appellate session without looking at the legislative history, ruled that the legislature could not possibly have intended to dispense with the sheriff, and thereby interpreted the statute to require that there be a citation and that the sheriff do the service. What this bill does, it restates the 1979 statute. The problem with doing nothing is it has created a great deal of confusion for administrative appeals. Because many people took administrative appeals without citing in the sheriff. Without putting a citation to the sheriff, so whatÃ¢ÂÂs happened is, they have been faced with jurisdictional motions under the 1983 appellate case saying that they do not have the right to bring the appeal because they failed to serve the process properly and of course, at this point in time, the limit for taking the appeal is passed and itÃ¢ÂÂs too late to correct the mistake.
Ã¢ÂÂAnd it seems to me that what the legislature ought to do is treat this as a clarification of reassertion that from 1979 on, what this statute did, was to mean you donÃ¢ÂÂt need the sheriff for that purpose.Ã¢ÂÂ Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Judiciary, Pt. 2, 1984 Sess., pp. 396-97.


 In the Senate, Senator Howard T. Owens, Jr., stated: Ã¢ÂÂIt would make it clear that a sheriff or other officer is not needed to serve process on an agency in an appeal from an administrative decision. There apparently has been a court decision that has thrown into question some prior action of the legislation, so it is really clarifying what the intention was of that particular piece of legislation.Ã¢ÂÂ 27 S. Proc., Pt. 2, 1984 Sess., p. 779.
In the House of Representatives, Representative Richard D. Tulisano stated: Ã¢ÂÂ[T]he purpose of this legislation is to make it clear and acknowledge that service of process does not have to be by sheriff of an appeal from an administrative agency.Ã¢ÂÂ 27 H.R. Proc., Pt. 2,1984 Sess., p. 722.


 Practice Book ÃÂ§ 142 provides: Ã¢ÂÂmotion to dismiss
Ã¢ÂÂAny defendant, wishing to contest the courtÃ¢ÂÂs jurisdiction, may do so even after having entered a general appearance, but must do so by filing a motion to dismiss within thirty days of the filing of an appearance. Except in summary process matters, the motion shall be placed on the short calendar to be held not less than fifteen days following the filing of the motion, unless the court otherwise directs.Ã¢ÂÂ


 Before the Joint Standing Committee on the Judiciary, David Biklen, executive director of the law revision commission, stated: Ã¢ÂÂLet me just give you a couple of examples of problems that these amendments attempt to address in the UAPA. . . . [WjeÃ¢ÂÂve worked on the service in [sic] filing requirements on appeal, an example of that on a state agency level the set of problems that you are now wrestling with on a local level, whereby a local and zoning appeal was dismissed for-failure to [serve] each person in that appeal. At least on the state level this act would avoid that sort of problem."" Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Judiciary, Pt. 1, 1988 Sess., p. 186.
Steve Frazzini, the executive director of the Hartford County Legal Aid Society, and a member of the advisory groÃÂ¼p that worked with the law revision commission on the proposed revision of the UAPA, also testified before the Judiciary Committee: Ã¢ÂÂThose of this committee who are lawyers . . . know that the current laws . . . about appealing Administrative Agency decisions are a trap for the unwary. . . . Basically, the courts have taken the position that thereÃ¢ÂÂs no right to appeal from Administrative Agency decisions except by statute and if the statute isnÃ¢ÂÂt followed in every detail, then youÃ¢ÂÂre thrown out of court.... The problem is that the present statute is very hard to follow .... I think itÃ¢ÂÂs really unfair that the appeal process is so difficult to understand and to comply with. What this bill does is it makes . . . things simpler. . . . [TJhe number of cases where appeals have been dismissed because some supposedly vital party, not the agency, but someone else [was] not served are also far too frequent. What this bill says is that if you serve the agency on time, then the authority to serve anybody else whoÃ¢ÂÂs concerned at the time isnÃ¢ÂÂt critical as long as you do serve them and as long as that party isnÃ¢ÂÂt prejudiced by your serving them late. ... So thatÃ¢ÂÂs the most important thing that . . . makes what you do to appeal [an] agency decision simpler and fairer.Ã¢ÂÂ Conn. Joint Committee Hearings, Judiciary, Pt. 1, 1988 Sess., pp. 263-64.
This line of criticism of our prior jurisprudence echoes that of Justice David Shea of this court: Ã¢ÂÂI believe this court took the wrong course many years ago when we began to treat virtually every deviation from the statutory norm as a defect that deprives a court of subject matter jurisdiction and thus to be unwaivable by the parties or subject to such considerations as lack of prejudice that are applied in other proceedings. We have been traveling down this path for too long, however, to turn back at this late *31time without some legislative direction.... Consequently, much as I deplore the jurisprudential path we have taken, I am constrained to continue upon it until such time as we may be directed otherwise by legislative authority.Ã¢ÂÂ Andrew Ansaldi Co. v. Planning & Zoning Commission, 207 Conn. 67, 75-76, 540 A.2d 59 (1988) (Shea, J., concurring); see Farricielli v. Personnel Appeal Board, 186 Conn. 198, 207-11, 440 A.2d 286 (1982) (Shea, J., dissenting). We believe that, by enacting General Statutes ÃÂ§ 4-183 (c) and (d), the legislature intended to heed these pleas for greater simplicity and fairness in the administrative appeal process.

Callahan, J.
This case concerns the proper application and use of a bequest made to the Yale School of Medicine in the will of Thomas F. Smallman, a physician. Smallman was an alumnus of the Yale School of Medicine, a member of the class of 1905. He died in Brooklyn, New York, in 1928, leaving a will that he had executed a short time prior to his death. He was survived by his wife, Jane C. Smallman. In article 22 of his will, Smallman left $225,000 in trust for his wife, directing that it be invested and that the net income be paid to her in quarterly installments during her lifetime, or until she remarried.
Article 22 also provided that upon the death or remarriage of Jane Smallman, Ã¢ÂÂthe net principal sum and net undistributed income therefrom, shall thereupon be paid to Yale College, at New Haven, Connecticut, to be used for the building of a wing for the Yale Medical School to be known as the Jane Smallman Wing, for the treatment of the sick poor.Ã¢ÂÂ Jane Smallman never remarried. She died in 1987 at the age of 106. Upon her death and the termination of the trust, the trustees paid over to the plaintiff, Yale University (Yale), the sum of $312,086.
At the time of the termination of the trust, the Yale School of Medicine no longer maintained separate physical facilities for the treatment of the Ã¢ÂÂsick poorÃ¢ÂÂ as it had in Thomas SmallmanÃ¢ÂÂs years as a student there. The amount received by Yale from the trust, moreover, was now insufficient to construct a new wing to the medical school. Because it could not comply with the terms of the will as written, Yale sought the advice of *34the attorney general in an attempt to achieve an agreement concerning an acceptable alternative use of SmallmanÃ¢ÂÂs bequest. The attorney general and Yale, however, were unable to agree on a utilization of the fund that would accommodate the decedentÃ¢ÂÂs wishes.
Yale subsequently filed suit in the Superior Court in the judicial district of New Haven pursuant to the Connecticut Uniform Management of Institutional Funds Act1 (CUMIFA), seeking the release of the restrictions in SmallmanÃ¢ÂÂs will that required that his bequest be used to build a wing to the medical school for the segregated treatment of the Ã¢ÂÂsick poor.Ã¢ÂÂ Yale- also sought a decree that, in creating a suitable memorial to Jane Smallman, it be allowed to use the fund for the benefit of its school of medicine in whatever manner it chose to further its educational purposes.
Yale alleged in its complaint that it sought release from the restrictions in SmallmanÃ¢ÂÂs will because the restrictions were now Ã¢ÂÂobsolete, inappropriate and impractical, in that: (a) The amount of the bequest is insufficient to cover the cost of a wing to a building; (b) The School of Medicine does not maintain, and it would be medically undesirable to maintain, separate physical facilities for the treatment of patients classified by income level; [and] (c) The creation of a facility Ã¢ÂÂfor the treatment of the sick poorÃ¢ÂÂ would violate the principle of treating all patients, regardless of their income or resources, in the same facilities.Ã¢ÂÂ See General Statutes ÃÂ§ 45a-533.2
*35In response, the attorney general moved to strike YaleÃ¢ÂÂs complaint, contending that SmallmanÃ¢ÂÂs bequest was not an institutional fund as defined by General Statutes ÃÂ§ 45a-527 (2) (B),* *3 and that the complaint consequently failed to state a cause of action under CUMIFA. See Practice Book ÃÂ§ 152. The trial court granted the attorney generalÃ¢ÂÂs motion to strike and thereafter rendered judgment against Yale. Yale appealed to the Appellate Court and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book ÃÂ§ 4023 and General Statutes ÃÂ§ 51-199 (c).
In granting the motion to strike, the trial court agreed with the attorney general that SmallmanÃ¢ÂÂs bequest was not possessed by Yale as an institutional fund as defined by ÃÂ§ 45a-527 (2). The court held, therefore, that Yale could not avail itself of General Statutes ÃÂ§ 45a-533 as an avenue of relief from the restrictions in SmallmanÃ¢ÂÂs will. The court reasoned that the building of a wing to the medical school to treat the Ã¢ÂÂsick poorÃ¢ÂÂ was Ã¢ÂÂonly incidental to the primary purpose of treating the poor when they became ill.Ã¢ÂÂ *36It appears to have concluded that SmallmanÃ¢ÂÂs bequest was not held for YaleÃ¢ÂÂs Ã¢ÂÂexclusive use, benefit or purposes,Ã¢ÂÂ and also that the bequest was one Ã¢ÂÂin which a beneficiary that is not an institution has an interest.Ã¢ÂÂ General Statutes ÃÂ§ 45a-527 (2) (B).
If either or both of the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs conclusions are correct, the fund created by SmallmanÃ¢ÂÂs will is not an institutional fund as defined by ÃÂ§ 45a-527 (2) (B). The court would have been correct, therefore, in striking YaleÃ¢ÂÂs complaint because ÃÂ§ 45a-533, pursuant to which Yale sought the release of the restrictions in the will, has application only to institutional funds.
The particular question posed by this appeal is extremely narrow.4 The issue of whether Yale may ultimately be entitled to a release or a modification5 of the restrictions in SmallmanÃ¢ÂÂs will is not before us. The only issue raised by the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs decision and the only issue that we decide is whether SmallmanÃ¢ÂÂs bequest is *37held by Yale as an institutional fund6 under ÃÂ§ 45a-527 (2). If it is, Yale is entitled to proceed with its action to seek relief from the restrictions in the will under ÃÂ§ 45a-533 and the trial court improperly dismissed its complaint.
Not surprisingly, the issue appears to be one of first impression. In the absence of prior authority to aid in the interpretation of ÃÂ§ 45a-527 (2) (B), we are guided by the meaning ascribed by its drafters to the parallel provision of the Uniform Management of Institutional Funds Act (UMIFA).7 Griffin v. S. W. Devanney & Co., 775 P.2d 555, 559 (Colo. 1989); 2B J. Sutherland, Statutory Construction (5th Ed. 1992) ÃÂ§ 52.05; see DeLuca v. C. W. Blakeslee & Sons, Inc., 174 Conn. 535, 540-41, 391 A.2d 170 (1978). Section 45a-527 (2) requires that in order to qualify as an institutional fund, a fund first must be held by an institution for Ã¢ÂÂits exclusive use, benefit or purposes.Ã¢ÂÂ The quoted language was adopted verbatim by the Connecticut legislature from the language of ÃÂ§ 1 (2) of UMIFA, 7A U.L.A. 712 (1985). In its published comments to that section, the commission that drafted UMIFA explained that the placing of a restriction on the use of a gift or bequest to an institution does not mean that the gift or bequest is not for the Ã¢ÂÂexclusive use, benefit or purposesÃ¢ÂÂ of the institution, provided the appointed use is one that is within the institutionÃ¢ÂÂs lawful purposes. The commission commented that Ã¢ÂÂ[t]he Ã¢ÂÂuse, benefit or purposesÃ¢ÂÂ of an institution broadly encompasses all of the activities permitted by its charter or other source of authority.Ã¢ÂÂ UMIFA, ÃÂ§ 1 (2), comment, 7A U.L.A. 713 (1985). Moreover, the commission noted that a Ã¢ÂÂfund to provide *38scholarships for students or medical care for indigent patients is held by the school or hospital for the institutionÃ¢ÂÂs purposes.Ã¢ÂÂ (Emphasis added.) Id.
A court can Ã¢ÂÂproperly consider the official comments as well as the published comments of the drafters as a source for determining the meaning of an ambiguous provision [of a uniform act].Ã¢ÂÂ 2B J. Sutherland, supra, ÃÂ§ 52.05; Hill v. Blake, 186 Conn. 404, 408, 441 A.2d 841 (1982); General Products Co. v. Bezzini, 33 Conn. Sup. 654, 656-57, 365 A.2d 843 (1976); Griffin v. S. W. Devanney & Co., supra, 560-61. Moreover, it is manifest that the legislature in enacting CUMIFA intended to implement the intention, meaning and objectives of the commission that drafted UMIFA. In ÃÂ§ 45a-534 the legislature explicitly stated that Ã¢ÂÂ[s]ections 45a-526 to 45a-534, inclusive, [CUMIFA] shall be so applied and construed as to effectuate their general purpose to make uniform the law with respect to the subject of said sections among those states which enact them.Ã¢ÂÂ Only if the intent of the drafters of a uniform act becomes the intent of the legislature in adopting it can uniformity be achieved. Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. v. Bartram, 158 Conn. 48, 64 n.3, 255 A.2d 828 (1969); Layne-Minnesota Co. v. Regents of University of Minnesota, 123 N.W.2d 371, 376 n.13 (Minn. 1963). Otherwise, there would be as many variations of a uniform act as there are legislatures that adopt it. Such a situation would completely thwart the purpose of uniform laws.
The treatment of the Ã¢ÂÂsick poorÃ¢ÂÂ is an activity in which the Yale School of Medicine can, and does, lawfully engage. The fund received by Yale from SmallmanÃ¢ÂÂs will therefore fits within the first prong of the definition of an institutional fund as contemplated by the commission that drafted the uniform law from which CUMIFA is derived.
*39Section 45a-527 (2) (B) also requires that, in order to qualify as an institutional fund, a fund may not be one Ã¢ÂÂin which a beneficiary that is not an institution has an interest, other than possible rights that could arise upon violation or failure of the purposes of the fund.Ã¢ÂÂ CUMIFA does not define Ã¢ÂÂbeneficiaryÃ¢ÂÂ and its meaning in the context in which it is used, contrary to the protestations of the attorney general, is ambiguous. We therefore are not confined to the words of the statute for insight as to the meaning of Ã¢ÂÂbeneficiary.Ã¢ÂÂ Zachs v. Groppo, 207 Conn. 683, 690, 542 A.2d 1145 (1988); King v. Board of Education, 203 Conn. 324, 332-33, 524 A.2d 1131 (1987).
The commission in its comments addressed to ÃÂ§ 1 (2) (ii) of UMIFA; 7A U.L.A. 713 (1985); which was adopted word for word by the legislature when it enacted ÃÂ§ 45a-527 (2) (B), explained that a fund held by an institution for Ã¢ÂÂan individual beneficiary such as an annuity trust8 or a unitrustÃ¢ÂÂ9 would not be an institutional fund. (Emphasis added.) The commission stated, however, that a fund held by a school for scholarships or by a hospital for the medical care of indigent patients Ã¢ÂÂis not deemed to be held for the benefit of a particular student or patient as distinct from the use, benefit or purposes of the institution, nor does the student or patient have an interest in the fund as a Ã¢ÂÂbeneficiary which is not an institution.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ UMIFA, ÃÂ§ 1 (2), comment, 7A U.L.A. 713 (1985). Although the Ã¢ÂÂsick poorÃ¢ÂÂ can be said to have an interest in SmallmanÃ¢ÂÂs bequest in the sense that they might have rights that accrue should the bequest fail or Yale violate its purposes, that situation is explicitly anticipated by ÃÂ§ 45a-527 (2) (B) *40and does not take the bequest outside the definition of an institutional fund. UMIFA, ÃÂ§ 1 (2), comment, 7A U.L.A. 713 (1985). From the explanatory comments of the commission that drafted UMIFA and a plain reading of ÃÂ§ 45a-534, we discern that it was the legislative intention that a fund bequeathed to an institution, for the ultimate benefit of an inchoate group or class, through the medium of the institution, is held by the institution for its Ã¢ÂÂexclusive use, benefit or purposesÃ¢ÂÂ within the meaning of ÃÂ§ 45a-527 (2) (B) and therefore is an institutional fund.
If the decision of the trial court were affirmed, it would eviscerate ÃÂ§ 45a-533. An institution that is a recipient of a gift without restrictions would have no need for recourse to ÃÂ§ 45a-533. It is only gifts upon which restrictions have been imposed that might require the release or variation of those restrictions. If, however, every gift to an institution, encumbered by restrictions, were excluded from the definition of an institutional fund under ÃÂ§ 45a-527 (2) (B), institutions that desired to seek the release of such restrictions as are Ã¢ÂÂobsolete, inappropriate or impracticableÃ¢ÂÂ would be unable to endeavor to secure their release pursuant to ÃÂ§ 45a-533. Such a result would render ÃÂ§ 45a-533 a superfluous piece of legislation. We do not attribute the intent to achieve such a result to the legislature. Hayes v. Smith, 194 Conn. 52, 58, 480 A.2d 425 (1984); State v. Cambria, 137 Conn. 604, 610, 80 A.2d 516 (1951). We conclude consequently that the fund derived from SmallmanÃ¢ÂÂs will is held by Yale as an institutional fund and Yale may seek relief pursuant to ÃÂ§ 45a-533 (b)10 from the restrictions imposed by the will.
The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings according to law.

 The attorney general in his brief voices concerns with regard to the constitutionality of General Statutes ÃÂ§ 45a-533, its relationship to the statute of charitable trusts, General Statutes ÃÂ§ 45a-514, the statute of charitable uses, General Statutes ÃÂ§ 47-2, and the doctrines of cy pres and approximation. Those concerns were not the basis for the attorney generalÃ¢ÂÂs motion to strike, were not raised in the trial court, are not the subject of this appeal and are premature. We therefore decline to address them.


 Under CUMIFA, the doctrine of cy pres or approximation applies to institutional funds. General Statutes ÃÂ§ 45a-533 (d). We believe that the dissent misconstrues the relationship between CUMIFA and the doctrines of cy pres and approximation. CUMIFA is not mutually exclusive of these doctrines; the trial court may apply, and indeed has a responsibility to apply, these doctrines to an institutional fund as equity dictates. Cf. Lockwood v. Killian, 172 Conn. 496, 508, 375 A.2d 998 (1977).
Ã¢ÂÂNew England courts apply a rather strict doctrine of separation of powers to deny legislative encroachment on judicial cy pres. The [Uniform Management of Institutional Funds] Act is compatible with the New England cases because the final decision is in the courts. See City of Hartford v. Larrabee Fund Association, 161 Conn. 312, 288 A.2d 71 (1971); Opinion of Justices, 101 N.H. 531, 133 A.2d 792 (1957).Ã¢ÂÂ Uniform Management of Institutional Funds Act, ÃÂ§ 7 (d), comment, 7A U.L.A. 723, 724 (1985).


 It is undisputed that Yale is an Ã¢ÂÂInstitutionÃ¢ÂÂ within the meaning of General Statutes ÃÂ§ 45a-527 (1).


 The Connecticut legislature adopted the Uniform Management of Institutional Funds Act (UMIFA) in 1973. Public Acts 1973, No. 73-548, now codified as General Statutes ÃÂ§ÃÂ§ 45a-526 through 45a-534, the Connecticut Uniform Management of Institutional Funds Act (CUMIFA).


 An annuity trust is a form of trust calling for payment of a fixed amount of income regardless of the amount of principal. BlackÃ¢ÂÂs Law Dictionary (5th Ed.).

Berdon, J.,
dissenting. In this case the majority leaves behind basic tenets of statutory construction in reaching the result that the Connecticut Uniform Management of Institutional Funds Act (CUMIFA),1 governs Dr. Thomas F. SmallmanÃ¢ÂÂs bequest made for the benefit of the Ã¢ÂÂsick poor.Ã¢ÂÂ The statutory interpretation lays the ground work for the bequest ending up in the coffers of Yale University for the benefit of its medical school. The majority concludes that SmallmanÃ¢ÂÂs bequest comes within CUMIFA because it is an Ã¢ÂÂinstitutional fundÃ¢ÂÂ pursuant to General Statutes ÃÂ§ 45a-527 (2).2 Because I believe that SmallmanÃ¢ÂÂs bequest does not come within the definition of an institutional fund under CUMIFA, I dissent.
SmallmanÃ¢ÂÂs bequest is simple and forthright. He left the sum of $225,000 in trust to pay the income to his wife and upon her death, Ã¢ÂÂthe net principal sum and net undistributed income therefrom, shall thereupon be paid to Yale College, at New Haven, Connecticut, to be used for the building of a wing for the Yale Medical School, to be known as the Jane Smallman Wing, for the treatment of the sick poor.Ã¢ÂÂ (Emphasis added.) It is clear that when the trustee paid $312,000 to Yale University (Yale), which sum represented the balance of the fund, Yale held it as trustee for the benefit of the sick poor. Dwyer v. Leonard, 100 Conn. 513, 518, *42124 A. 28 (1924);3 see Averill v. Lewis, 106 Conn. 582, 590, 138 A. 815 (1927); 2 Restatement (Second), Trusts ÃÂ§ 348 (1959).
By labeling this bequest an institutional fund under CUMIFA, the majority gives the Superior Court the power to Ã¢ÂÂrelease the restriction in whole or in partÃ¢ÂÂ if Ã¢ÂÂthe restriction is obsolete, inappropriate or impracticable.Ã¢ÂÂ General Statutes ÃÂ§ 45a-533. There is no question that in 1993 SmallmanÃ¢ÂÂs bequest of $312,000 cannot build a Ã¢ÂÂwing for the Yale Medical School . . . for the treatment of the sick poor,Ã¢ÂÂ and is therefore obsolete and impracticable. Under these circumstances, if CUMIFA applies, the trial court may release the restriction and the $312,000 becomes a gift to Yale. A review of YaleÃ¢ÂÂs prayer for relief in this matter indicates that this is exactly the direction the gift is headed; Yale seeks to release the restriction and obtain a decree from the court permitting the fund to be used by Ã¢ÂÂYale University for the benefit of its School of Medicine in whatever manner it may choose in the furtherance of its educational purposes . . . .Ã¢ÂÂ4 (Emphasis added.)
If, however, Yale were required to petition the court for relief under the doctrine of cy pres, the court would be authorized to release the restriction, but only by directing that the fund be used to approximate the gen*43eral intent of SmallmanÃ¢ÂÂthat is, to benefit the sick poor. Duncan v. Higgins, 129 Conn. 136, 140, 26 A.2d 849 (1942). The difference is criticalÃ¢ÂÂunder CUMIFA, Yale may use the fund for its own purposes; under the doctrine of cy pres, Yale must maintain and expend the funds for the sick poor.
The plain language of ÃÂ§ 45a-527 (2) sets forth a two part test for determining whether a fund is an institutional fund under CUMIFA: (1) the fund must be held by the institution Ã¢ÂÂfor its exclusive use, benefit or purposesÃ¢ÂÂ; and (2) the institution must be the beneficiary of the fund. Under ordinary principles of statutory construction, we look first to the plain language of the statute to ascertain its meaning. Rhodes v. Hartford, 201 Conn. 89, 93, 513 A.2d 124 (1986). Instead, the majority looks to comments published not by Connecticut legislators, but by the drafters of the Uniform Management of Institutional Funds Act.5 Only if the statutory language is ambiguous may we refer to such commentary. See State v. Kozlowski, 199 Conn. 667, 673, 509 A.2d 20 (1986).
In the present case, the plaintiff is unable to satisfy either requirement of the two part test. In making this determination, we must focus on the clear and unequivocal language of the bequest. The fund is not for YaleÃ¢ÂÂs Ã¢ÂÂexclusive use,Ã¢ÂÂ nor is it for YaleÃ¢ÂÂs Ã¢ÂÂexclusive . . . benefit,Ã¢ÂÂ nor is it for YaleÃ¢ÂÂs Ã¢ÂÂexclusive . . . purposes.Ã¢ÂÂ Rather, SmailmanÃ¢ÂÂs gift was designated for the exclusive use and benefit of an identifiable groupÃ¢ÂÂthe sick poor. Yale, the institution, is not the beneficiary of SmallmanÃ¢ÂÂs bequest, but merely the trustee. The gift to build a hospital wing was intended to benefit the sick poor.
Furthermore, the majorityÃ¢ÂÂs construction of CUMIFA renders meaningless the statute on charita*44ble trusts, General Statutes ÃÂ§ 45a-514, which requires that a trust Ã¢ÂÂshall forever remain to the uses and purposes to which it has been granted according to the true intent and meaning of the grantor and to no other use.Ã¢ÂÂ6 Moreover, General Statutes ÃÂ§ 47-2 provides that all Ã¢ÂÂestates granted ... for the relief of the poor ... or for any other public and charitable use, shall forever remain to the uses to which they were granted, according to the true intent and meaning of the grantor, and to no other use whatever.Ã¢ÂÂ The majority refuses to consider these statutes in interpreting CUMIFA and considering whether SmallmanÃ¢ÂÂs bequest is an institutional fund because they were not the basis for the attorney generalÃ¢ÂÂs motion to strike and were not raised before the trial court. No authority or rationale is cited for this unusual standard of review.
Not only is the construction of a statute a question of law; Southington v. State Board of Labor Relations, 210 Conn. 549, 559, 556 A.2d 166 (1989); but there is a fundamental rule of statutory construction that Ã¢ÂÂstatutes relating to the same subject matter may be looked to for guidance in reaching an understanding of the meaning of a statutory term.Ã¢ÂÂ Doe v. Institute of Living, Inc., 175 Conn. 49, 58, 392 A.2d 491 (1978). The entire statutory framework of administering charitable bequests must be harmonized; see Malerba v. Cessna Aircraft Co., 210 Conn. 189, 195, 554 A.2d 287 (1989); and we cannot ignore this body of statutory and common law merely because the attorney general failed to raise it in the trial court.
*45Finally, because CUMIFA provisions for releasing restrictions are in derogation of the common law, the provisions must be strictly construed. Yale University School of Medicine v. Collier, 206 Conn. 31, 36, 536 A.2d 588 (1988). Only when it is clear that the donor intended to make the institution the object of his or her charitable bequest, should a fund be labeled an institutional fund. In this case, the unequivocal object of the bequest was to benefit the sick poor.
I am not quite certain of the majorityÃ¢ÂÂs meaning when it states in footnote 5 that Ã¢ÂÂthe doctrine of cy pres or approximation applies to institutional funds. General Statutes ÃÂ§ 45a-533 (d).Ã¢ÂÂ If the majority is suggesting that ÃÂ§ 45a-533 (d) gives the trial court authority to apply the principles of cy pres, even though YaleÃ¢ÂÂs complaint in this matter seeks relief solely under CUMIFA, it should say so. Although such a holding would take the sharp edges off CUMIFA by giving the trial court the discretion to apply the doctrine of cy pres, I believe this would be a legislative excursion on the part of the majority.7 Section 45a-533 (d) merely states that Ã¢ÂÂ[t]his section does not limit the application of the doctrine of cy pres or approximation.Ã¢ÂÂ (Emphasis added.) In other words, the statute permits a trustee to bring a petition under cy pres, but it does not give the court the power to employ cy pres principles when the complaint seeks relief under CUMIFA only. The comments published by the commission that drafted the Uniform *46Management of Institutional Funds Act, although not completely clear, tend to support this interpretation. The comments to ÃÂ§ 7 provide in part: Ã¢ÂÂSubsection (d) makes it clear that the [Uniform Management of Institutional Funds] Act does not purport to limit the established doctrine of cy pres. . . . The Uniform Act provision is far less broad; it applies only to the release of restrictions on the gift under limited circumstances. Ã¢ÂÂ (Emphasis added.) Uniform Management of Institutional Funds Act, ÃÂ§ 7 (d), comment, 7A U.L.A. 723, 724 (1985).
Accordingly, I dissent.

 General Statutes ÃÂ§ÃÂ§ 45a-526 through 45a-534.


 General Statutes ÃÂ§ 45a-527 (2) provides: Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂInstitutional fundÃ¢ÂÂ means a fund held by an institution for its exclusive use, benefit or purposes, but does not include (A) a fund held for an institution by a trustee that is not an institution, other than a fund which is held for a charitable community trust or (B) a fund in which a beneficiary that is not an institution has an interest, other than possible rights that could arise upon violation or failure of the purposes of the fund.Ã¢ÂÂ


 Ã¢ÂÂOrdinarily it is of little consequence whether a gift to a charitable corporation for one or more of its corporate purposes be in form a gift outright or a gift in trust. In either case the corporation holds it upon a trust which may be enforced through the visitorial power of the State.Ã¢ÂÂ Dwyer v. Leonard, 100 Conn. 513, 518, 124 A. 28 (1924).


 YaleÃ¢ÂÂs prayer for relief claims: Ã¢ÂÂ1. A decree releasing the restrictions on the use of the bequest of Dr. Smallman to the effect that it be used Ã¢ÂÂfor the building of a wing for Yale Medical SchoolÃ¢ÂÂ and that the wing be used Ã¢ÂÂfor the treatment of the sick poor.Ã¢ÂÂ
Ã¢ÂÂ2. A decree permitting the bequest of Dr. Smallman to be used by Yale University for the benefit of its School of Medicine in whatever manner it may choose in the furtherance of its educational purposes as a suitable memorial in the name of Jane Smallman.
Ã¢ÂÂ3. Such other relief as may be appropriate.Ã¢ÂÂ


 See footnote 7 of the majority opinion.


 General Statutes ÃÂ§ 45a-514 provides: Ã¢ÂÂAny charitable trust or use created in writing or by deed by any resident of the state, or any public and charitable trust or use for aiding and assisting any person or persons to be selected by the trustees of such trust or use to acquire education, shall forever remain to the uses and purposes to which it has been granted according to the true intent and meaning of the grantor and to no other use.Ã¢ÂÂ


 General Statutes ÃÂ§ 45a-533 (b) gives the trial court discretion to release a restriction that is obsolete, inappropriate or impracticable in whole or in part without regard to cy pres. Notwithstanding ÃÂ§ 45a-533 (b), the majority seems to be holding that the trial court must apply the doctrine of cy pres to an institutional fund as equity dictates. If this is the case, what is the purpose of ÃÂ§ 45a-533 (b)? Indeed in the comments to the uniform act there is not even a suggestion that it was the intent of the drafters to require the application of cy pres, even if equity dictates, if the fund is designated an institutional fund. The institution may choose to invoke cy pres, but if it fails to do so, the courtÃ¢ÂÂs discretion under CUMIFA is to release in whole or in part the restriction or to deny the application.

Borden, J.
The issue in this appeal is whether, after a defendant has been found not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect for an earlier offense and has been committed for psychiatric treatment, the trial court has the authority to stay the execution of a criminal sentence, imposed for a subsequent offense, until the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs psychiatric commitment has ended. The petitioner, David Copeland, appeals, upon a grant of certification,1 from the Appellate CourtÃ¢ÂÂs affirmance of the judgment of the trial court denying his petition for a writ of habeas corpus.2 We affirm.
*48The Appellate Court set forth the relevant facts. Ã¢ÂÂOn June 21, 1977, the petitioner was found not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect of the crimes of attempted murder, reckless endangerment and criminal mischief. He was thereafter committed to the Connecticut Valley Hospital, a state institution, for twenty years. On June 5,1981, he was charged with sexually assaulting a female worker at the hospital. After a trial to the court, Spallone, J., the petitioner was found guilty of first degree sexual assault and second degree kidnapping.* *3 He was sentenced on December 6,1982, to a total effective prison term of fifteen to thirty years to run consecutively to his psychiatric commitment. The petitioner began serving his criminal sentence on January 18,1985, when he was released from the psychiatric institution. In 1986, the petitioner sought habeas corpus relief. After the petitioner filed an amended petition in August, 1988, the case was tried, on March 13,1990, to the court, Potter, J., which denied the writ on April 18, 1990.Ã¢ÂÂ Copeland v. Warden, 26 Conn. App. 10, 11-12, 596 A.2d 477 (1991). That court, in a two to one decision, affirmed the judgment of the trial court.
The petitioner claims that the habeas court improperly concluded that it was within the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs inherent sentencing powers to impose a criminal sentence consecutive to his psychiatric commitment. We disagree.
We first note that the petitioner in this case has received only one criminal sentence, and thus the sentence for the sexual assault and kidnapping is not consecutive to another criminal sentence. There is a *49fundamental distinction between an incarceration pursuant to a criminal sentence and a commitment following an insanity acquittal. It is, in part, this distinction that compels us to treat this case as a Ã¢ÂÂstayÃ¢ÂÂ case rather than as a Ã¢ÂÂconsecutive sentenceÃ¢ÂÂ case. See Payne v. Fairfield Hills Hospital, 215 Conn. 675, 683-84, 578 A.2d 1025 (1990). Ã¢ÂÂConsecutive sentenceÃ¢ÂÂ ordinarily refers to one criminal sentence that commences consecutive to another criminal sentence. Therefore, although framed as a consecutive sentencing issue by the parties and by this court in our grant of certification to appeal, upon closer examination this case is better described as raising the related question of whether a trial court has the authority to stay the execution of a criminal sentence until a defendantÃ¢ÂÂs psychiatric commitment has concluded.
The common law has long recognized a courtÃ¢ÂÂs ability to stay the execution of a criminal sentence in a variety of contexts. For example, in Talley v. Beavers, 141 Ga. 110, 80 S.E. 556 (1913), the defendant was found to have a mental disease or defect that arose following his conviction but before the sentence on the conviction was executed. The Georgia Supreme Court affirmed the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs stay of the execution of the sentence until his psychiatric commitment ended. Id.; see Ex parte State, 150 Ala. 489, 43 So. 490 (1907) (stay of execution of sentence proper pending inquiry into defendantÃ¢ÂÂs sanity); Ex parte Hinson, 156 N.C. 250, 72 S.E. 310 (1911) (stay of execution of sentence while defendant put affairs in order); State v. Abbott, 87 S.C. 466, 70 S.E. 6 (1911) (stay of execution of sentence proper upon showing of compelling reasons or serious hardship); Spencer v. State, 125 Tenn. 64, 140 S.W. 597 (1911) (court has power to stay execution of sentence in order to achieve proper enforcement of the sentence or to safeguard the rights in the particular controversy).
*50Accordingly, the Ã¢ÂÂpower to stay the execution of a sentence, in whole or in part, in a criminal case, is inherent in every court having final jurisdiction in such cases, unless otherwise provided by statute.Ã¢ÂÂ Weber v. State, 58 Ohio 616, 51 N.E. 116 (1898); see State v. Taylor, 153 Conn. 72, 80, 214 A.2d 362 (1965), cert. denied, 384 U.S. 921, 84 S. Ct. 1372, 16 L. Ed. 2d 442 (1966). Absent an abuse of discretion or a limiting statute, therefore, a trial court has the ability to stay the execution of a criminal sentence in order to fulfill its duty to implement the penalties dictated by the legislature for criminal offenses and to promote the ends of justice.
The legislature, by enacting our penal code, has deemed it appropriate to criminalize the behavior of which the petitioner in this case was found guilty, and to attach appropriate penalties. In order to effectuate the goals of the legislature, therefore, the trial court properly may stay the execution of the criminal sentence until the petitionerÃ¢ÂÂs psychiatric commitment has ended.4
This conclusion is supported by drawing an analogy to the related issue of consecutive sentencing. A trial court may conclude, in a case in which a defendant had previously been convicted for another offense, that a concurrent sentence would not adequately meet the sentencing goals of retribution or deterrence because such a sentence would allow the defendant to avoid additional incarceration for the subsequent offense. Similarly, as in this case, a trial court may reasonably conclude that a criminal defendant should not be able to avoid punishment merely because he engaged in the criminal conduct during his psychiatric commitment. *51Indeed, the authority to stay the execution of the sentence is further justified in the present context because, unlike a defendant in a case involving consecutive sentences, the petitioner here has not been subject to any term of penal incarceration.
In addition to satisfying the stateÃ¢ÂÂs interest in adequately punishing criminal behavior, the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs stay of the execution of the sentence benefits the petitioner as well. The stay allows the petitioner to continue to receive psychiatric care until he has obtained a sufficient state of mental health. Only then is he required to serve the criminal sentence imposed because of his criminal conduct. Cf. Talley v. Beavers, supra; State v. Braggs, 9 Ohio Misc. 32, 221 N.E.2d 493 (Ohio Juv. 1966); Mitts v. State, 345 P.2d 913 (Okla. App. 1959), cert. denied, 363 U.S. 845, 80 S. Ct. 1620, 4 L. Ed. 2d 1730 (1960).
The only jurisdiction that has addressed the particular issue presented has reached a similar conclusion. In State v. Flemming, 409 A.2d 220, 225-26 (Me. 1979), the defendant was committed to a psychiatric institution following a verdict of not guilty of murder by reason of insanity. During his commitment, the defendant escaped, in violation of MaineÃ¢ÂÂs penal code. After having been found guilty on the escape charge, the defendant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of five years with execution of the sentence stayed until his discharge from the psychiatric institution. Id., 222. On appeal, the Maine Supreme Court concluded that it was within the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs inherent sentencing powers to stay the execution of the sentence until the defendant was discharged from the institution: Ã¢ÂÂPunishment for escape should not be ignored simply because a person happens to be in a mental institution. In enacting the [criminal code,] the Legislature determined that criminal penalties should flow from an escape of this nature. Therefore, we deem it entirely rational that a presid*52ing justice, faced with the dilemma created when an inmate escapes from a mental institution, should have the authority to suspend the imposition of criminal penalties until such time as the mental disease or defect has been treated.Ã¢ÂÂ Id., 225-26. The same reasoning applies here.
The petitioner, adopting the position of the dissenting opinion in the Appellate Court, argues that even if the trial court historically had the power to impose a criminal sentence to begin at the conclusion of his psychiatric commitment, the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs inherent sentencing powers have been circumscribed by General Statutes ÃÂ§ 53a-37.5 See Copeland v. Warden, supra, 14 (Lavery, J., dissenting). Section 53a-37 provides that Ã¢ÂÂwhen a person who is subject to any undischarged term of imprisonment imposed at a previous time by a court of this state is sentenced to an additional term of imprisonment, the sentence or sentences imposed by the court shall run either concurrently or consecutively with respect to each other and to the undischarged term or terms in such manner as the court directs at the time of sentence.Ã¢ÂÂ We are not persuaded.
*53This case, as noted above, does not involve a question of consecutive sentencing. The statute is limited by its plain language to those instances in which a court imposes an additional criminal sentence on a defendant already serving a criminal sentence previously imposed by a Connecticut court. The statute does not address the courtÃ¢ÂÂs authority to stay the execution of a sentence for a subsequent offense until the completion of a defendantÃ¢ÂÂs psychiatric commitment following a verdict of not guilty in an earlier case.
Moreover, Ã¢ÂÂ[i]t is . . . a rule of statutory construction that statutes in derogation of the common law are to be strictly construed. ... No statute is to be construed as altering the common law, farther than its words import. It is not to be construed as making any innovation upon the common law which it does not fairly express. ...Ã¢ÂÂ (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) State v. Nugent, 199 Conn. 537, 548, 508 A.2d 728 (1986). In light of the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs common law inherent sentencing power to stay the execution of a criminal sentence, we refuse to read ÃÂ§ 53a-37, in the absence of express language, as imposing limits on that power.
We also note that the interpretation suggested by the petitioner is inconsistent with State v. Williamson, 206 Conn. 685, 701-702, 539 A.2d 561 (1988), and State v. Walzer, 9 Conn. App. 365, 367-68, 518 A.2d 966 (1986) , cert. denied, 202 Conn. 802, 519 A.2d 1207 (1987) . In each case, the defendant challenged the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs imposition of a sentence that ran consecutively to a sentence imposed by a court in another jurisdiction. State v. Williamson, supra, 701; State v. Walzer, supra, 367. Both this court and the Appellate Court concluded that ÃÂ§ 53a-37, although not expressly authorizing such a sentence, did not prohibit the trial court from exercising its inherent sentencing powers to impose a *54sentence consecutive to the other jurisdictionÃ¢ÂÂs term of imprisonment.6
Finally, a contrary reading of ÃÂ§ 53a-37 would deprive a trial court of the authority to impose the very punishment mandated by the legislature. If a court did not have the authority to stay the execution of the sentence, an individual would be free to commit a crime with impunity solely because of the fortuity of a current psychiatric commitment. We refuse to ascribe to the legislature, in enacting ÃÂ§ 53a-37, the intent to produce such a bizarre result. See, e.g., Fairfield Plumbing & Heating Supply Corporation v. Kosa, 220 Conn. 643, 650, 600 A.2d 1 (1991).
The judgment is affirmed.
In this opinion the other justices concurred.

 We granted the certification to appeal limited to the following question: Ã¢ÂÂAfter a defendant has been found not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect, does the trial court have the authority to impose a criminal sentence consecutive to the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs psychiatric commitment?Ã¢ÂÂ Copeland v. Warden, 220 Conn. 926, 598 A.2d 365 (1991).


 The petitioner chose to assert his claim that the sentence is illegal by way of a petition for habeas corpus. We note that he could have raised the same issue on direct appeal or by filing a motion with the trial court pursuant to Practice Book ÃÂ§ 935. Section 935 provides that the Ã¢ÂÂjudicial authority may at any time correct an illegal sentence or other illegal disposition, or it may correct a sentence imposed in an illegal manner or any other disposition made in an illegal manner.Ã¢ÂÂ
Because our grant of certification to appeal has not raised this procedural issue, nor has the state challenged the petition on that basis, we express no opinion on whether habeas corpus is an appropriate vehicle by which to challenge the legality of a sentence. We note, however, that regardless of any possible procedural obligations to raise the claim on direct appeal or under ÃÂ§ 935, ordinarily it is to a defendantÃ¢ÂÂs advantage to move in the trial court, pursuant to ÃÂ§ 935, to correct a purportedly illegal sentence after *48the sentence is imposed. This method would ordinarily yield a more prompt consideration of the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs challenge to the sentence than would the filing of a petition for habeas corpus, which usually entails considerably more delay than does a motion pursuant to ÃÂ§ 935.


 The petitioner unsuccessfully asserted the affirmative defense of mental disease or defect to the sexual assault and kidnapping charges.


 The trial court also has the authority, pursuant to General Statutes ÃÂ§ÃÂ§ 53a-28 through 53a-30, to suspend the execution of a criminal sentence by imposing probation or granting a conditional discharge. If a defendant violates the terms of the probation or conditional discharge, the court may execute the suspended sentence. General Statutes ÃÂ§ÃÂ§ 53a-32 (b) and 53a-33.


 General Statutes ÃÂ§ 53a-37 provides: Ã¢ÂÂmultiple sentences: concurrent or consecutive, minimum term. When multiple sentences of imprisonment are imposed on a person at the same time, or when a person who is subject to any undischarged term of imprisonment imposed at a previous time by a court of this state is sentenced to an additional term of imprisonment, the sentence or sentences imposed by the court shall run either concurrently or consecutively with respect to each other and to the undischarged term or terms in such manner as the court directs at the time of sentence. The court shall state whether the respective maxima and minima shall run concurrently or consecutively with respect to each other, and shall state in conclusion the effective sentence imposed. When a person is sentenced for two or more counts each constituting a separate offense, the court may order that the term of imprisonment for the second and subsequent counts be for a fixed number of years each. The court in such cases shall not set any minimum term of imprisonment except under the first count, and the fixed number of years imposed for the second and subsequent counts shall be added to the maximum term imposed by the court on the first count.Ã¢ÂÂ


 We note that the sentence imposed by the trial court in this case could be characterized as Ã¢ÂÂunexecutedÃ¢ÂÂ and thereby may be subject to modification. See State v. Walzer, 208 Conn. 420, 425, 430, 545 A.2d 559 (1988). In Walzer, we addressed the issue of whether a court has the power to modify a sentence after the expiration of the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs appeal bond. We concluded that, under the facts of that case, the court did not have the authority to modify the sentence after the appeal bond had expired because a judgment mittimus had issued at the time the defendant was originally sentenced.
Ã¢ÂÂIn a criminal case the imposition of sentence is the judgment of the court. State v. Smith, 149 Conn. 487, 489 [181 A.2d 446 (1962)]. When the sentence is put into effect and the prisoner is taken in execution, custody is transferred from the court to the custodian of the penal institution. At this point jurisdiction of the court over the prisoner terminates. Ã¢ÂÂ (Internal quotation marks omitted.) State v. Walzer, supra, 424-25.
The trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs decision in the present case to stay the execution raises a similar question. The stay imposed in the present case, however, is designed merely to change when the service of the sentence will begin rather than to determine if the sentence should begin, as is the issue in a stay of execution pending an appeal of the underlying judgment. Because of this difference, a trial court choosing to stay the execution of the sentence until after a period of psychiatric commitment should issue an appropriate mittimus indicating the terms of the stay pending that commitment, in order to transfer custody of the defendant from the court to the commissioner of correction.

Callahan, J.
A jury found the defendant, Erik C. Rasmussen, guilty of the murder of his wife, in violation of General Statutes ÃÂ§ ÃÂ³Sa-ÃÂ±ia.1 The defendant has appealed to this court pursuant to General Statutes ÃÂ§ 51-199 (b) (3) from the judgment of the trial court sentencing him to a term of imprisonment of thirty-five years. He claims that the court improperly': (1) denied his request to instruct the jury on lesser included *57offenses; (2) denied his motion for a judgment of acquittal; (3) denied his motions to suppress various evidence; (4) refused to excuse a juror and denied a related motion for a mistrial; (5) refused to instruct the jury on his theory of defense; and (6) denied his motion to dismiss and for a mistrial for failure of the state to disclose material exculpatory evidence. We find the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs claims unpersuasive and, therefore, affirm the judgment of conviction.
The jury could reasonably have found the following facts. Shortly before 2 a.m., on May 5,1988, the state police responded to a telephone call from the defendant who reported that his wife, Loreli Rasmussen, had been killed. Wearing only a robe, the defendant, together with two dogs, met Troopers John Kananowicz and James Brady at the front door when they arrived at his residence. When he saw the troopers, the defendant screamed, Ã¢ÂÂCome in, come in, my wifeÃ¢ÂÂs dead, upstairs, upstairs in the bedroom.Ã¢ÂÂ After securing the dogs, the defendant led the troopers to the doorway of an upstairs bedroom. He pushed open the bedroom door revealing the unclothed, blood-smeared body of his wife lying face up on the floor in a pool of blood. A wooden dowel protruded five or six inches from her chest. Kananowicz, believing the Ã¢ÂÂodd situationÃ¢ÂÂ he had encountered to be Ã¢ÂÂvery suspicious in nature,Ã¢ÂÂ read the Miranda warnings to the defendant at 2:23 a.m. When Detective Michael Foley arrived at the scene at approximately 3:15 a.m., the defendant was lying on the floor of the first floor foyer crying and hyperventilating. Foley introduced himself to the defendant and, in order to put him more at ease and to protect the scene, asked the defendant to dress and accompany him outside to his police car. The two sat in the front seat of the car while Foley asked the defendant to describe what had happened in the house.
*58According to the defendant, the couple had eaten dinner at approximately 8 p.m. on May 4, 1988, and had gone to bed at about 9:30 p.m. The defendant was awakened by a noise that sounded as if someone was hitting a wall or falling on the floor. The victimÃ¢ÂÂs German shepherd was still on the bed and the coupleÃ¢ÂÂs poodle was in the room, but the victim was not in the room. The defendant called out to his wife. Hearing no response, he awakened the German shepherd and gave her a command to bark. The defendant then proceeded down the hallway and found the victimÃ¢ÂÂs body on the floor in the spare bedroom. He activated the burglar alarm and called the police.
Because the defendant continued to be distraught, Foley transported him to the Troop E barracks where Ã¢ÂÂhe would be more comfortable.Ã¢ÂÂ When they arrived at the barracks at approximately 3:30 a.m., Foley took the defendant to a conference room with freely swinging glass-paneled double doors, windows, a large table, some chairs and a telephone. As Foley went over the events of the prior evening with the defendant, he observed scratch marks on the inside of the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs left arm, red marks and scrapes on the back of his right wrist, and smeared blood on his hands and elbow. The defendant explained that he had received the scratches from holding onto the dogs while waiting for the police to arrive and that the blood had come from holding his wifeÃ¢ÂÂs body. Foley then explained the nature of the investigation and the need to search the house for evidence. The defendant thereafter read and signed a form consenting to a search of the house. He also volunteered information about other buildings on the property so that they could be included in the consent form. Foley then asked the defendant if he needed anything and the defendant requested and received a glass of water.
Detective Kenneth Bissonnette arrived at the Troop E barracks from the crime scene at approximately *594 a.m. Foley briefed him, and Bissonnette returned to the scene to continue his investigation before again returning to the barracks where Foley introduced him to the defendant at 4:51 a.m. The defendant consented to BissonnetteÃ¢ÂÂs request to take photographs of the scratches and blood smears on his arms and hands. The defendant also consented to requests to take off his robe2 and to allow photographs to be taken of additional scratches on his upper body and hip.
Foley then resumed his conversation with the defendant and expressed disbelief that an intruder could have entered the house, engaged in a violent struggle with the victim, and fled without rousing the defendant or the dogs. Foley, at that time, asked again about the scratch marks. The defendant told Foley that he wanted to cooperate and to talk with the police but did not want to discuss the scratch marks further without an attorney present.
At 5:15 a.m., Foley told the defendant that he was not in custody and asked if there was anything he could do for him. The defendant said that he wanted his father to be contacted. Foley did so. At 5:24 a.m., Bissonnette orally advised the defendant of his Miranda rights and offered him the use of a telephone to call an attorney. The defendant declined.
Between 5:45 a.m. and 6 a.m., the defendant agreed to allow Foley to take fingernail scrapings and swabs of the blood smears. The defendantÃ¢ÂÂs parents arrived at 6 a.m. and visited alone with the defendant in the conference room. As a result of the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs interrogation, the police procured a search warrant for his person. At 7:45 a.m., Foley and Bissonnette took the defendant from the conference room to a processing room to execute this search warrant.
*60The jury could also have found that the German shepherd was a well trained guard and attack dog that behaved in an extremely loyal and protective manner toward Loreli. She often barked when people approached the home and became aggressive even when people with whom she was familiar would bump into Loreli.
The jury also heard testimony that an autopsy of the body had revealed: two incised wounds and four stab wounds on the victimÃ¢ÂÂs neck;3 a bruise on the nose caused by blunt trauma; abrasions and bruising on the right side of the neck; scratches on the chest and defense wounds4 on both hands caused by a sharp-edged instrument; and a stab wound in the mid portion of the chest. The stab wounds to the neck cut the right jugular vein, trachea, larynx and esophagus. The wooden dowel found in the stab wound in the chest was attached to a masonÃ¢ÂÂs trowel from which the handle had been removed and the edges sharpened. This spear-like instrument had been thrust into the victimÃ¢ÂÂs chest so that it cut through the entire thoracic cage and exited through the victimÃ¢ÂÂs back. The face and eyelids showed petechial hemorrhaging.5 The presence of petechiae could be consistent with strangulation even when nei*61ther death nor loss of consciousness results.6 The cause of death was determined to be the stab wounds to the neck and chest that led to exsanguination. State medical examiners analyzed the victimÃ¢ÂÂs stomach contents and testified that she had died within two hours of eating.
The jury heard additional medical evidence based on observations at the scene and laboratory examinations of physical evidence removed from the scene. Henry Lee, director and chief criminalist of the state police forensic crime laboratory, testified that his examination of bloodstain patterns on the soles of both feet and the upper body of the victim indicated that she had been in the following positions: upright when she received an injury to her neck that caused blood to drip downward; then sitting; and, finally lying face up when the spear was thrust into her chest.7 On the basis of this *62evidence, he concluded that the victim had been conscious and struggling to defend herself when she was stabbed in the throat.
On a bed in a bedroom adjoining the room where the victim was found, the police found a bloody, four foot long wooden dowel with a Ã¢ÂÂT nutÃ¢ÂÂ connector on one end. Lee testified that this dowel had been connected to, and then had been forcefully pulled apart from, the end of the dowel that protruded from the victimÃ¢ÂÂs chest.
The victimÃ¢ÂÂs mother testified that, on the day before the killing, the victim had confided to her that she and the defendant had been arguing about the planning and preparation for the defendant's May 5 birthday party. She also testified that the victim had told her that the defendant was feeling under pressure to complete the renovation of the only bathroom in the house before the party. There was also testimony that although the defendant had said that the couple had gone to bed about 9:30 p.m., the bed did not appear to have been slept in.8 Further, there was evidence that stereo equipment was moved from the living room and stacked on a desk next to an opened first floor office window. The equipment was stacked so that it blocked entry and exit through the window. Dust on the window sill and desk was undisturbed. The surface of the desk contained undisturbed papers and materials. The latent prints on the desk and stereo equipment belonged to the defendant. The window screen had been cut from the outside. Police also discovered an open window on the second floor in the bedroom adjacent to the bedroom where the body was located. This window, which opened on to the roof of a porch, was near the bed on which the four foot long wooden dowel was found.
*63According to the theory of the crime advanced by the state at trial, the defendant killed the victim after an argument, some three and one-half hours before he telephoned the police. During the intervening time, the state theorized, he cleaned himself up and staged the scene to make it appear as if a burglar had entered the house through the first floor window, moved stereo equipment next to the first floor window, went upstairs and killed the victim, then fled through the upstairs window on to the porch roof, and jumped to the ground.
I
The defendant first invokes the protections of the fifth, sixth and fourteenth amendments to the constitution of the United States and article first, ÃÂ§ 8 of the Connecticut constitution9 and claims that the trial court improperly denied his request to charge the jury as to the lesser included offenses of manslaughter in the first and second degrees pursuant to General Statutes ÃÂ§ÃÂ§ 53a-55 (a) (1) and (3) and 53a-56 (a) (l).10
*64At trial, although the defendant maintained that he was not the perpetrator of the crime and sought an acquittal, he nonetheless requested that the jury be instructed on what he claimed were lesser included offenses within the crime of murder. The defendant maintained, for the first time in his supplemental requests to charge, that from the evidence the jury could reasonably have found that, in strangling the victim, he had intended to cause only serious physical injury rather than death, or that, without intent to cause death, he had recklessly engaged in conduct that created a grave risk of the victimÃ¢ÂÂs death and thereby caused her death, or that he simply recklessly caused the death of the victim. The trial court denied the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs requests and ruled that the jury could consider only a verdict of guilty or not guilty of the charged crime of murder. We agree with the courtÃ¢ÂÂs ruling.
The basis for the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs constitutional claim under either the federal or state constitution is the proposition that a defendant is constitutionally entitled to a lesser included offense charge where warranted by the evidence. The Supreme Court of the United States has decided that such a charge is constitutionally required in a capital case. Beck v. Alabama, 447 U.S. 625, 627,100 S. Ct. 2382, 65 L. Ed. 2d 392 (1980). We need not explore the ramifications of this issue on *65constitutional grounds, however, because we conclude that the evidence in this case did not warrant the requested charge.
The defendantÃ¢ÂÂs claim of innocence did not automatically preclude him from requesting an instruction on Ã¢ÂÂlesser included homicides that require a less serious degree of culpable intent.Ã¢ÂÂ State v. Rodriguez, 180 Conn. 382, 405, 429 A.2d 919 (1980); see also General Statutes ÃÂ§ 53a-45 (c); State v. Burge, 195 Conn. 232, 244-45, 487 A.2d 532 (1985); State v. Falby, 187 Conn. 6, 29, 444 A.2d 213 (1982). The propriety of the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs request for instructions on manslaughter depends, therefore, on whether the conditions set forth in State v. Whistnant, 179 Conn. 576, 588, 427 A.2d 414 (1980), have been satisfied. State v. Rodriguez, supra, 407.
Ã¢ÂÂThe law of lesser included offenses is a common law doctrine that requires a defendant to demonstrate his compliance with the four conditions stated in [Whistnant]: Ã¢ÂÂ(1) an appropriate instruction is requested by either the state or the defendant; (2) it is not possible to commit the greater offense, in the manner described in the information or bill of particulars, without having first committed the lesser; (3) there is some evidence, introduced by either the state or the defendant, or by a combination of their proofs, which justifies conviction of the lesser offense; and (4) the proof of the element or elements which differentiate the lesser offense from the offense charged is sufficiently in dispute to permit the jury consistently to find the defendant innocent of the greater offense but guilty of the lesser.Ã¢ÂÂ State v. Herring, 210 Conn. 78, 104-105, 554 A.2d 686, cert. denied, 492 U.S. 912, 109 S. Ct. 3230, 106 L. Ed. 2d 579 (1989); State v. Green, 207 Conn. 1, 11, 540 A.2d 659 (1988).Ã¢ÂÂ State v. Edwards, 214 Conn. 57, 62-63, 570 A.2d 193 (1990). The defendant *66timely filed his request to charge prior to closing arguments, and took an exception when the trial court did not give the requested instructions.
The defendant argues that all four conditions of Whistnant have been established and thus that the trial court improperly refused to instruct the jury with respect to the lesser included offenses of manslaughter in the first and second degrees as he had requested. The state argues that the defendant failed to meet the first, third and fourth conditions.11 We enter the Whistnant analysis through the third condition.12
The third condition of Whistnant requires Ã¢ÂÂsome evidence . . . which justifies conviction of the lesser offense . . . .Ã¢ÂÂ State v. Whistnant, supra, 588. The defendant argues in his brief that the third condition of Whistnant Ã¢ÂÂis satisfied where evidence suggests Ã¢ÂÂat least a possibilityÃ¢ÂÂ that the elements of the lesser offense have been established. State v. Fernandez, 5 Conn. App. 40, 45, 496 A.2d 533 (1985), quoting State v. Falby, [supra, 30].Ã¢ÂÂ In State v. Falby, supra, on the basis of the evidence admitted at trial that consisted of the testimony of a medical expert and a victim of *67a prior similar crime by the defendant, we concluded that there was Ã¢ÂÂat least a possibilityÃ¢ÂÂ that the defendant had acted with a less culpable mental state and had properly requested an instruction on lesser included offenses. Falby, therefore, is an example of those cases in which it is undisputed that some evidence relevant to a lesser included offense instruction had been introduced at trial, and we were called upon to determine whether such evidence justified a lesser included offense instruction. As we stated in State v. Falby, supra, 29, Ã¢ÂÂ[t]he issue before us ... is whether the evidence at trial . . . can support a conviction for [the lesser offense].Ã¢ÂÂ Other decisions analyzing claims based on the third condition of Whistnant have involved cases in which the defendant had not introduced any evidence to support a requested lesser included offense charge. In those cases we have concluded that the instruction was not required. See, e.g., State v. Smith, 212 Conn. 593, 609, 563 A.2d 671 (1989) (Ã¢ÂÂthere was no evidence before the jury to support the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs contention that the jury could have inferred that the defendant acted with a less culpable mental stateÃ¢ÂÂ); State v. Dolphin, 195 Conn. 444, 449, 488 A.2d 812, cert. denied, 474 U.S. 833, 106 S. Ct. 103, 88 L. Ed. 2d 84 (1985) (Ã¢ÂÂ[t]here was no evidence at the trialÃ¢ÂÂ). The defendant is incorrect in interpreting the cases that apply the Whistnant test to mean that the presentation of an abstract theory in a request to charge or the mere introduction of some evidence satisfies the third condition of Whistnant. Such a rule would paradoxically require a trial court to provide a requested instruction on a lesser included offense and then, if the jury convicted the defendant of the lesser offense, to render a judgment of acquittal in response to a defendantÃ¢ÂÂs motion based on insufficiency of the evidence. We determine that in order to meet the third prong of the Whistnant test, there must be sufficient evidence, intro*68duced by either the state or the defendant, or by a combination of their proofs, to justify a finding of guilt of the lesser offense. See J. Bruckmann, G. Nash & J. Katz, Connecticut Criminal Caselaw HandbookÃ¢ÂÂA PractitionerÃ¢ÂÂs Guide (1989) pp. 425-26, and (1992 Sup.) pp. 432-33.
This case, therefore, requires that we determine whether there was sufficient evidence on which the jury could reasonably have found that the defendant had merely acted recklessly, either with or without extreme indifference to human life, or with the intent to cause only serious physical injury to the victim rather than her death. In making this determination, Ã¢ÂÂwe must consider the evidence available at trial in the light most favorable to the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs request. State v. Herring, supra, 106. Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ[T]he juryÃ¢ÂÂs role as fact-finder is so central to our jurisprudence that, in close cases, the trial court should generally opt in favor of giving an instruction on a lesser included offense, if it is requested.Ã¢ÂÂ United States v. Comer, 421 F.2d 1149, 1154 (D.C. Cir. 1970).Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ State v. Edwards, supra, 64. Ã¢ÂÂOtherwise the defendant would lose the right to have the jury pass upon every factual issue fairly presented by the evidence.Ã¢ÂÂ State v. Smith, 185 Conn. 63, 78, 441 A.2d 84 (1981).
The defendantÃ¢ÂÂs first supplemental request to charge on the lesser included offense of manslaughter in the first degree pursuant to ÃÂ§ 53a-55 (a) (3)13 included the following statement of essential facts: Ã¢ÂÂAll testimony. (The jury could find that due to the lack of motive in this case, the defendant did not have the specific intent to murder his wife; however, since there has been evidence that the victim was initially strangled, the jury could infer that the defendant strangled his wife during an argument; that he did not intend to murder her, *69but that he attempted to cover up his conduct by his subsequent activity, and therefore, the defendant recklessly engaged in conduct creating a grave risk of death.)Ã¢ÂÂ The defendant included the reference to Ã¢ÂÂall testimonyÃ¢ÂÂ followed by an identical explanation in his other two supplemental requests to charge on manslaughter. In other words, the gist of the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs claim in all three of his requests to charge on lesser included offenses was that he had strangled his wife without the intent to cause her death and that he stabbed her and staged a burglary to cover up the strangulation.
Sections 53a-55 (a) (3) and 53a-56 (a) (1) both require evidence that the defendant acted recklessly: that he was aware of and consciously disregarded a substantial and unjustifiable risk. General Statutes ÃÂ§ 53a-3 (13); State v. Smith, supra, 185 Conn. 75; State v. Maselli, 182 Conn. 66, 70-73, 437 A.2d 836 (1980), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 1083, 101 S. Ct. 868, 66 L. Ed. 2d 807 (1981). Section 53a-55 (a) (1) requires evidence that the defendant acted only with the intent to cause serious physical injury to the victim. State v. Bzdyra, 165 Conn. 400, 403, 334 A.2d 917 (1973). The defendant argues that four categories of evidence supported his claim for a charge on the lesser included manslaughter offenses: (1) lack of motive; (2) strangulation; (3) the birthday party argument; and (4) the cover-up. We are unpersuaded.
The defendant first points to testimony concerning the lack of motive; the stateÃ¢ÂÂs acknowledgment in its summation that Ã¢ÂÂ[t]he State canÃ¢ÂÂt prove a motive here, doesnÃ¢ÂÂt have a motive, canÃ¢ÂÂt claim a motiveÃ¢ÂÂ; and the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs charge that Ã¢ÂÂif no motive can be inferred or found, that may well tend to raise a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused.Ã¢ÂÂ Nevertheless, as the trial court commented appropriately in its charge, Ã¢ÂÂ[i]t is not essential that the State prove motive. Motive is *70not an element of the crime of murder.Ã¢ÂÂ See State v. Delgado, 178 Conn. 448, 423 A.2d 106 (1979); State v. Bzdyra, supra. A jury, finding lack of motive, could, but is not obligated to, conclude that the defendant did not murder the victim and thus return a verdict of not guilty on the charge of murder. Such a finding would not be particularly relevant, however, in the juryÃ¢ÂÂs deliberations as to whether the defendant merely acted recklessly or demonstrated an intent only to cause serious physical injury when he killed his wife. A person acts Ã¢ÂÂintentionallyÃ¢ÂÂ in relation to a criminal statute defining an offense Ã¢ÂÂwhen his conscious objective is to cause such result or to engage in such conduct . . . .Ã¢ÂÂ General Statutes ÃÂ§ 53a-3 (11); State v. Carpenter, 214 Conn. 77, 82, 570 A.2d 203 (1990); State v. Avcollie, 178 Conn. 450, 466, 423 A.2d 118 (1979), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 1015, 100 S. Ct. 667, 62 L. Ed. 2d 645 (1980). The jury could find simultaneously, without any contradiction, that the couple presented the appearance of a loving relationship and that the defendant murdered his wife. Lack of evidence of motive standing alone did not entitle the defendant to a charge on the lesser included offenses requested.
Next the defendant points to evidence of strangulation as indicating that he might have killed his wife without the intent to do so and then staged the scene observed by the state police officers to cover up his actions. Although the record supports the references in the requested instructions to some evidence of strangulation, even DiMaio, the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs pathologist, testified that the victim Ã¢ÂÂwas stabbed in the neck, and she was conscious when she was being stabbed in the neck. And thatÃ¢ÂÂs shown by the fact that she's got defense injuries. SheÃ¢ÂÂs got a cut on each hand. . . . [S]he brought her legs back to try to push herself up, to push the person off her chest .... [The] smeared blood on [her] heels . . . most probably came from blood on the car*71pet in that area, digging her heels into the carpet, trying to push up.Ã¢ÂÂ14 (Emphasis added.) To be entitled to his requested instructions, the defendant had the obligation to specify, in his request to charge, evidence that the jury could reasonably draw upon to infer either that the victim died from strangulation or that she was unconscious or otherwise appeared to be unconscious when she was stabbed in the throat and chest.15 That evidence is simply nonexistent.
The defendant then notes accurately that the victimÃ¢ÂÂs mother and others testified concerning tension between the defendant and the victim. The couple apparently argued over preparations for the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs birthday party planned for the day after the murder and the redecorating of their homeÃ¢ÂÂs only bathroom. We are not persuaded, however, that these facts, viewed in the context of the circumstances of the victimÃ¢ÂÂs death, are probative of the crime of manslaughter rather than murder. Moreover, whether the jury decided that the domestic tension resulted in the violence of murder or manslaughter relates to the question of motive which, as we concluded above, is not dispositive.
Last, the defendant calls our attention to the considerable evidence in the record concerning the theory of a cover-up of the killing. He maintains that the *72absence of motive makes it logical to conclude that, in an uncharacteristic fit of rage, he strangled the victim without the intent to cause her death, subsequently-tried to cover up the marks on her neck with a sharp instrument and then staged the burglary implicating an intruder with a homemade spear. He claims that is a more reasonable scenario than the stateÃ¢ÂÂs theory that the defendant slashed his wifeÃ¢ÂÂs throat and plunged a spear into her chest while she was conscious. The defendantÃ¢ÂÂs theory, however, fails because of the complete lack of evidence that the victim was strangled into unconsciousness before she was killed. The defendant fails to explain how his theory has any efficacy when related to the stabbing of a conscious victim.
We conclude that the cumulative effect of the evidence in the record compelled the jury, if it found the defendant was the perpetrator, to find that he had intended to kill his wife. The facts presented excluded the possibility that the victim had been unconscious at the time of the stabbings and incised wounds. Ã¢ÂÂ 'One who uses a deadly weapon upon a vital part of another will be deemed to have intended the probable result of that act, and from such a circumstance a proper inference may be drawn in some cases that there was an intent to kill. . . .Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ State v. Bzdyra, supra, 404; F. Wharton, Homicide (3d Ed.) pp. 7, 115. Ã¢ÂÂA pistol, dirk-knife, or gun is a deadly weapon per se.Ã¢ÂÂ State v. Litman, 106 Conn. 345, 352, 138 A. 132 (1927). It requires nothing more than common sense to conclude that slashes to the neck of a conscious victim that severed the victimÃ¢ÂÂs jugular vein, trachea, larynx and esophagus and the impalement of the victim by a spear are evidence of an intent to kill rather than mere recklessness or intent to injure seriously.
Because the evidence, introduced by either the defendant or the state, or by a combination of their proofs, was not sufficient to justify conviction of the *73lesser included offenses, the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs refusal to instruct the jury on the lesser included offenses of manslaughter was not improper. An acquittal on a charge of murder, like a conviction on a lesser included manslaughter offense, cannot be the result of capriciousness by a jury. State v. Montanez, 219 Conn. 16, 23, 592 A.2d 149 (1991); State v. Manley, 195 Conn. 567, 579, 489 A.2d 1024 (1985); State v. Whistnant, supra, 588. Jurors should not be encouraged to engage in speculation. State v. Manley, supra, 580. To provide an instruction on lesser included offenses without satisfying the third condition of Whistnant encourages speculation and capriciousness on the part of the jurors. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court properly denied the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs requests for lesser included offense instructions.
II
The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly denied his motions for judgment of acquittal because the state did not provide sufficient evidence to permit a jury reasonably to find that the defendant had the specific intent to cause the death of his wife. In support of his claim that the state did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt his specific intent to kill his wife, the defendant argues that the evidence at best only supports his theory, raised on appeal, that out of anger and in the midst of an argument, he had intended to cause only serious physical injury to the victim, or that he simply acted recklessly and killed her in doing so. We disagree.
The two part Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂstandard of review of an insufficiency claim is clear. Ã¢ÂÂWe first review the evidence at trial, construing it in the light most favorable to sustaining the facts expressly found by the trial court or impliedly found by the jury. We then decide whether, upon the facts thus established and the inferences reasonably *74drawn therefrom, the trial court or the jury could reasonably have concluded that the cumulative effect of the evidence established the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.Ã¢ÂÂ. . .Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ (Citations omitted.) State v. Pinnock, 220 Conn. 765, 770-71, 601 A.2d 521 (1992), quoting State v. Lewis, 220 Conn. 602, 606, 600 A.2d 1330 (1991). Ã¢ÂÂThe elements of intentional murder with which the defendant was charged under General Statutes ÃÂ§ 53a-54a are (1) intent, (2) causation and (3) death by killing as opposed to death by accident or suicide. State v. Avcollie, [supra, 460].Ã¢ÂÂ State v. Weinberg, 215 Conn. 231, 253-54, 575 A.2d 1003, cert. denied, 498 U.S. 967, 111 S. Ct. 430, 112 L. Ed. 2d 413 (1990). Intent involves Ã¢ÂÂa mental process which ordinarily can be proven only by circumstantial evidence.Ã¢ÂÂ State v. Zdanis, 182 Conn. 388, 396, 438 A.2d 696 (1980), cert. denied, 450 U.S. 1003, 101 S. Ct. 1715, 68 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1981). Intent may be inferred from the nature of any weapons used, the manner in which they were used and the nature and number of wounds inflicted. State v. Montanez, supra, 23; State v. Zdanis, supra.
Considering the evidence of the weapons used, the manner of their use, the severity and number of wounds inflicted on the victim, and the attempt by the defendant to cover up his crime, we conclude that the jury could reasonably have found that the defendant had the specific intent to cause the victimÃ¢ÂÂs death.
Ill
The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly denied his various motions to suppress evidence. Specifically, he claims that the trial court improperly denied his motions to suppress: (1) certain of his oral statements because they were the product of an unconstitutional custodial interrogation; (2) certain other of his oral statements, tangible evidence and observations because they were the product of an illegal arrest; and *75(3) evidence seized during the search of his person because the warrant affidavit included information obtained from the defendant as a result of his illegal detention. In these claims, the defendant again invokes the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the constitution of the United States and article first, ÃÂ§ 8 of the Connecticut constitution.
A
The defendant first claims a violation of the privilege against self-incrimination afforded him under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 444, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1966); State v. Falby, 187 Conn. 6, 11 and n.l, 444 A.2d 213 (1982); because the oral statements obtained from the defendant by the police resulted from a custodial interrogation. The defendant argues that the police neither properly advised him of his Miranda rights nor obtained a knowing, intelligent and voluntary waiver of these rights and that, therefore, the trial court improperly denied his motion to suppress these oral statements.
After a hearing on the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs motion to suppress, the trial court, Vasington, J., found that the defendant had not been in custody or deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way during his interrogation by Detectives Michael Foley and Kenneth Bissonnette on May 5,1988, at the time that he made the oral statements offered at trial to which he objected. The court further found that the totality of the circumstances had not given the defendant any reasonable belief either that he was in custody or that he was not free to leave. The court found, moreover, that the police had advised the defendant of his Miranda rights prior to the occurrence of any questioning and that he understood his rights and made a knowing, intelligent and voluntary decision to answer questions. Accordingly, it ruled that Miranda warnings, although not man*76dated, had been given and that the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs statements were admissible. See State v. Pittman, 209 Conn. 596, 606, 553 A.2d 155 (1989), and cases cited therein.
The defendant has the burden of proving custodial interrogation; State v. Copeland, 205 Conn. 201, 207, 530 A.2d 603 (1987); State v. Brown, 199 Conn. 47, 51, 505 A.2d 1225 (1986); before the state must prove that adequate warnings of the rights that inhere in the privilege against self-incrimination were given to the defendant and that the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs waiver of his rights was constitutionally valid; State v. Weidenhof, 205 Conn. 262, 267, 533 A.2d 545 (1987); State v. Gray, 200 Conn. 523, 531-33, 512 A.2d 217, cert. denied, 479 U.S. 940, 107 S. Ct. 423, 93 L. Ed. 2d 373 (1986). Ã¢ÂÂCustodial interrogation [occurs when] Ã¢ÂÂquestioning [is] initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way.Ã¢ÂÂ Miranda v. Arizona, supra . . . .Ã¢ÂÂ State v. Brown, supra; see State v. Hoeplinger, 206 Conn. 278, 286, 537 A.2d 1010 (1988). Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂAlthough the circumstances of each case must certainly influence a determination of whether a suspect is Ã¢ÂÂin custodyÃ¢ÂÂ for purposes of receiving Miranda protection, the ultimate inquiry is simply whether there is a Ã¢ÂÂformal arrest or restraint on freedom of movementÃ¢ÂÂ of the degree associated with a formal arrest. [Oregon v. Mathiason, 429 U.S. 492, 495, 97 S. Ct. 711, 50 L. Ed. 2d 714 (1977)].Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ State v. Pittman, supra, 608, quoting California v. Beheler, 463 U.S. 1121, 1125, 103 S. Ct. 3517, 77 L. Ed. 2d 1275 (1983). A person is in custody only if a reasonable person would have believed he was not free to leave. State v. Hoeplinger, supra, 286-87. Ã¢ÂÂWe must look at the totality of the circumstances of the questioning in order to determine whether a Ã¢ÂÂreasonable personÃ¢ÂÂ would have construed those circumstances as placing him in a custody situation.Ã¢ÂÂ Id., 287. We will not overturn the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs *77factual finding that the defendant was not in custody unless it was clearly erroneous; State v. Madera, 210 Conn. 22, 49-50, 554 A.2d 263 (1989); State v. Ostroski, 186 Conn. 287, 292, 440 A.2d 984, cert. denied, 459 U.S. 878, 103 S. Ct. 173, 74 L. Ed. 2d 142 (1982); see Practice Book ÃÂ§ 4061; but Ã¢ÂÂwill, however, carefully review the record to ascertain whether the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs finding is supported by substantial evidence.Ã¢ÂÂ State v. Pittman, supra, 606.
The defendant contends that the facts of State v. Hoeplinger, supra, 287-88, mirror the facts of this case and support his claim that the trial court improperly denied his motion to suppress the statements. We disagree. In Hoeplinger, the defendant was under constant supervision. He was ordered to sit in the cruiser. When he got out and reentered his house, the police ordered him back into the cruiser. In order to prevent him from washing his hands, the police would not allow him to go into the bathroom by himself. By contrast, in the present case, the defendant went voluntarily with Foley to the police cruiser and to the barracks where they sat and talked in a large conference room that had windows and freely swinging doors. The defendant indicated that he wanted to cooperate. His only two requests, for a glass of water and for contact with his parents, were satisfied. Police left the conference room so that he could visit alone with his parents. The defendant was not handcuffed or restrained in any way. He never asked to leave or tried to leave the barracks. A suspect in a crime is not in custody every time he is asked questions at a police station. State v. Northrop, 213 Conn. 405, 415, 568 A.2d 439 (1990). The defendant has not met his burden of proving that he was in custody at the time he made the statements at issue to the police.
The trial court also found that the police had advised the defendant of his Miranda rights at three different *78times. Although the state concedes that there was no express waiver of Miranda rights by the defendant, it argues that a waiver may be inferred from the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs actions and course of conduct. State v. Kuskowski, 200 Conn. 82, 88, 510 A.2d 172 (1986); State v. Toste, 198 Conn. 573, 582, 504 A.2d 1036 (1986). Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂThe fact that a suspect chooses to speak after being informed of his rights is, of course, highly probative.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ State v. Madera, supra, 50, quoting Oregon v. Elstad, 470 U.S. 298, 318, 105 S. Ct. 1285, 84 L. Ed. 2d 222 (1985). Ã¢ÂÂ[W]e have held that the assertion of the right to remain silent after an initial willingness to speak with police is a strong indication that the defendant understood his rights.Ã¢ÂÂ State v. Barrett, 205 Conn. 437, 451, 534 A.2d 219 (1987). The fact that the defendant invoked his right to counsel after he had spoken with the police indicated that he was aware of his rights and had voluntarily waived them up until that point. State v. Pellegrino, 194 Conn. 279, 289, 480 A.2d 537 (1984); see State v. Pecoraro, 198 Conn. 203, 208, 502 A.2d 396 (1985).
Moreover, there is no evidence in the record to indicate any coercive, deceptive or overreaching conduct by the police that caused the defendant to waive his Miranda rights.16 The defendant had completed two years of college, owned his own home and operated his own business. He initiated the contact with the police when he telephoned to request help. Foley treated the defendant as a victim and as a witness. The defendantÃ¢ÂÂs statements and conduct, until he said that he did *79not want to discuss the scratch marks further, indicated that he wanted to cooperate with the investigation. Even after expressing that limitation on the conversation, he said that he wished to continue to cooperate.
The defendant also argues that his emotional state prevented him from understanding the nature of his rights. We are not persuaded. Ã¢ÂÂWe stated in State v. Toste, [supra, 580-81,] that a determination of whether a defendant has Ã¢ÂÂknowingly and intelligentlyÃ¢ÂÂ waived his rights under Miranda Ã¢ÂÂdepends in part on the competency of the defendant, or, in other words, on his ability to understand and act upon his constitutional rights.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ State v. Hernandez, 204 Conn. 377, 396, 528 A.2d 794 (1987). Factors that may be considered in making this determination include, inter alia: the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs experience with the police and familiarity with the Miranda warnings; his level of intelligence, age, level of education, vocabulary and ability to read and write in the language in which the warnings were given; his emotional state; and the existence of any mental disease. Id., 396-97, and cases cited therein. Evidence that the defendant appeared distraught does not alone prevent a knowing waiver of Miranda rights. State v. Roseboro, 221 Conn. 430, 441-43, 604 A.2d 1286 (1992); State v. Harris, 188 Conn. 574, 582, 452 A.2d 634 (1982), cert. denied, 460 U.S. 1089, 103 S. Ct. 1785, 76 L. Ed. 2d 354 (1983).
A thorough examination of the entire record reveals that the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs findings were supported by substantial evidence. State v. Shifflett, 199 Conn. 718, 729, 508 A.2d 748 (1986); State v. Toste, supra, 580; State v. Alexander, 197 Conn. 180, 185, 496 A.2d 486 (1985). The trial court could reasonably have found both that the defendant was not in custody at the time he made the statements at issue to the police and also that the decision to make these statements was made after proper warnings and was knowing, intelligent and voluntary.
*80B
The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly denied his motion to suppress all tangible evidence and observations, as well as all statements, obtained on May 5, 1988, because they were the product of an illegal arrest in violation of the fourth amendment to the constitution of the United States and article first, ÃÂ§ 7 of the Connecticut constitution.17 We disagree.
When a defendant claims that he was the subject of an illegal arrest, the admissibility of physical evidence and statements by the defendant Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂturns on the answers to two subsidiary questions: (1) whether the defendant was Ã¢ÂÂseizedÃ¢ÂÂ within the meaning of the fourth amendment to the United States constitution and article first, ÃÂ§ 7 of the Connecticut constitution so as to invoke their protection, and, if so, (2) whether he was Ã¢ÂÂreasonablyÃ¢ÂÂ seized, that is, whether there was probable cause to seize him.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ State v. Acquin, 187 Conn. 647, 651, 448 A.2d 163 (1982), cert. denied, 463 U.S. 1229, 103 S. Ct. 3570, 77 L. Ed. 2d 1411 (1983); State v. Damon, 214 Conn. 146, 152, 570 A.2d 700, cert. denied, 490 U.S. 1069, 111 S. Ct. 65, 112 L. Ed. 2d *8140 (1990). We have stated that a person has been Ã¢ÂÂseizedÃ¢ÂÂ when Ã¢ÂÂ 'by means of physical force or show of authority, his freedom of movement is restrained. . . .Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ State v. Ostroski, supra, 291-92, quoting United, States v. Mendenhall, 446 U.S. 544, 553-54, 100 S. Ct. 1870, 64 L. Ed. 2d 497, reh. denied, 448 U.S. 908, 100 S. Ct. 3051, 65 L. Ed. 2d 1138 (1980); State v. Oquendo, 223 Conn. 635, 649-50, 652, 613 A.2d 1300 (1992).
In light of our conclusion that the defendant was not in custody, this claim of the defendant must fail. After the defendant had indicated that he wished an attorney present, the police prudently decided to obtain a warrant to execute a search of the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs person. We conclude that the statements, observations and tangible items at issue did not result from an unconstitutional seizure of the defendant and were properly admitted into evidence.
C
The defendant next argues that the trial court improperly determined that the information alleged in the affidavit supported a finding of probable cause upon which a warrant for the search of his person could have appropriately issued. This argument has no merit.
In support of his argument, the defendant first claims that the affidavit relied on to obtain the warrant contained information acquired from the defendant as a result of an illegal detention and consequently should be discounted. Because we have previously rejected his claim that he was illegally detained, this argument fails. We turn then to his argument that the information alleged in the affidavit was insufficient as a matter of law to support a finding of probable cause.
The validity of a search warrant depends upon whether the supporting affidavits provide a substan*82tial basis for a finding of probable cause. State v. Barton, 219 Conn. 529, 545, 594 A.2d 917 (1991). Ã¢ÂÂWhere the circumstances for finding probable cause are detailed, where a substantial basis for crediting the source of information is apparent, and when a magistrate has in fact found probable cause, the reviewing court should not invalidate the warrant by application of rigid analytical categories.Ã¢ÂÂ Id. Ã¢ÂÂIn reviewing the sufficiency of an affidavit for a search warrant we do not conduct a de novo review. Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 103 S. Ct. 2317, 76 L. Ed. 2d 527, reh. denied, 463 U.S. 1237, 104 S. Ct. 33, 77 L. Ed. 2d 1453 (1983). Rather, the traditional standard of review is whether the magistrate had a substantial basis for concluding that a search would uncover evidence of wrongdoing. Id.Ã¢ÂÂ State v. Couture, 194 Conn. 530, 546, 482 A.2d 300 (1984), cert. denied, 496 U.S. 1192, 105 S. Ct. 967, 83 L. Ed. 2d 971 (1985).
The affidavit in this case consists of seven paragraphs. The first two recite the training and experience of the affiants, two state police officers. Paragraphs three and four set forth details concerning the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs telephone call to the state police requesting assistance, the arrival of the state police at the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs residence, the discovery of the victimÃ¢ÂÂs body, the appearance and behavior of the defendant and conditions at the crime scene. The fifth paragraph recites, inter alia, that the police observed Ã¢ÂÂfresh scratches on the inside left forearm and on the back of the right wrist . . . a blood-like substance on the right palm and right elbow . . . [and] additional scratches on the left shoulder and armpitÃ¢ÂÂ of the defendant. The sixth paragraph summarizes the conclusion of the affiants based on these facts and their experience and training that probable cause existed to believe that the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs person contained evidence in the form of blood, hair, fibers, *83wounds and scratches. The seventh paragraph requests that the court issue the warrant on the basis of the information provided therein.
From our review of the affidavit, in light of the requirements of the fourth amendment to the United States constitution and article first, ÃÂ§ 7 of the Connecticut constitution, we conclude that there was a substantial basis for the issuing magistrate to conclude that there was probable cause to believe that evidence material to the investigation of the victimÃ¢ÂÂs murder would be found on the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs person.
IV
The defendant next advances separate, but related claims that the jury that decided his guilt might have been influenced to rush to judgment by the forthcoming vacation plans of one of the jurors. The defendant claims the trial court improperly denied his motion to replace that juror with an alternate juror and improperly failed to advise the jury that artificial time constraints should not interfere with their deliberations. The defendant also claims that the trial court, because it failed to replace the juror or to advise the jury that no artificial time constraints should interfere with its deliberations, should have granted his motions for a mistrial. He contends that the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs failure to take the actions he requested violated his right to a fair trial under the sixth and fourteenth amendments to the constitution of the United States and article first, ÃÂ§ 8 of the Connecticut constitution. We disagree.
On November 29,1990, the trial court, having realized that the trial was taking longer than it had originally anticipated, inquired whether any of the jurors had plans that would interfere with their deliberations. A juror, Richard Blackwood, responded that he was planning to take a vacation for two weeks over Christmas, beginning on Monday, December 17,1990. *84The defendant, on December 3, 1990, moved that Blackwood be excused. The court stated, with the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs agreement, that a hearing on the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs motion would be delayed until after the presentation of the evidence had been completed.
On December 10, 1990, after all the evidence had been taken and the jury had been charged, the court heard argument on the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs pending motion. The defendant argued that Blackwood might possibly feel pressured to reach a verdict quickly because of his upcoming vacation plans and should be excused. The court denied the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs motion and excused the alternate on the basis that BlackwoodÃ¢ÂÂs removal from the jury panel was unnecessary. The jury was thereafter instructed to commence its deliberations. Shortly, the jury had a note delivered to the court containing three questions, the first of which asked, Ã¢ÂÂAre there any time limits for our deliberations?Ã¢ÂÂ18 After conferring with counsel, the court, in response told the jurors that the only time limits were that they would start at 10 a.m. and continue until 5 p.m., with the usual morning and afternoon break and lunch hour, unless the jury wished to start earlier or stay later. On December 13, 1990, at 12:25 p.m., the jury reported that it had reached a verdict.
The defendantÃ¢ÂÂs first claim, that the trial court improperly refused to excuse Blackwood, implicates the issue of BlackwoodÃ¢ÂÂs competency to remain a part of the jury panel. When challenging the competency of a juror, it is the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs burden to prove the jurorÃ¢ÂÂs disqualification. State v. Cubano, 203 Conn. 81, 90, 523 A.2d 495 (1987). Moreover, the jurorÃ¢ÂÂs disqualification must be proved by facts, not by mere speculation or conjecture. State v. Almeda, 189 Conn. 303, 313, 455 A.2d 1326 (1983).
*85In this case, the defendant failed to demonstrate that Blackwood was disqualified to remain on the jury panel because his vacation plans would in fact influence his deliberations or those of the other members of the panel. BlackwoodÃ¢ÂÂs vacation was not to begin until December 17, 1990. The jury returned a verdict on December 13, four days before BlackwoodÃ¢ÂÂs vacation was to commence. The time taken for deliberations and the time remaining until the commencement of Black-woodÃ¢ÂÂs vacation do not lend support to the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs contention that BlackwoodÃ¢ÂÂs vacation plans somehow affected the verdict. The defendantÃ¢ÂÂs claim that the trial court improperly failed to excuse Blackwood from the jury panel because of his vacation plans is, therefore, grounded in speculation and is without merit.
Furthermore, Ã¢ÂÂ[t]he jury, in the absence of a fair indication to the contrary, is presumed to have followed the instructions of the court.Ã¢ÂÂ State v. Glenn, 194 Conn. 483, 497, 481 A.2d 741 (1984). On December 7, 1990, in its charge to the jury, the court instructed the panel that it must Ã¢ÂÂcoolly, considerately, with your minds unswerved from your duty . . . determine your verdict from a careful consideration of the facts.Ã¢ÂÂ There is nothing in the record to suggest that the jury did not follow the courtÃ¢ÂÂs instructions to deliberate carefully. Because there was no indication that BlackwoodÃ¢ÂÂs forthcoming vacation plans would have influenced his deliberations, we conclude that the trial court properly denied the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs motion to excuse the juror.
The defendant also claims that BlackwoodÃ¢ÂÂs vacation plans had the potential to constrain the entire panelÃ¢ÂÂs deliberations and that the trial court should have specifically advised the jury that such constraints should not interfere with their deliberations. Because the trial court failed to give such an instruction, the defendant *86argues that he was deprived of a fair trial and that the trial court should have granted his motion for a mistrial. We are not persuaded.
On December 12, 1990, during the course of the juryÃ¢ÂÂs deliberations, the trial court, with both counsel, gave careful consideration to whether the jury might feel constrained to reach a verdict because of Black-woodÃ¢ÂÂs forthcoming vacation plans. The court explored alternatives to mitigate any possible influence on the juryÃ¢ÂÂs deliberations that might arise if deliberations continued. That same day, the court decided that at that point in the juryÃ¢ÂÂs deliberations, an inquiry concerning the possible effect of BlackwoodÃ¢ÂÂs vacation plans was premature and might exacerbate the very problem sought to be avoided. The court stated that in order not to put pressure on the jury concerning BlackwoodÃ¢ÂÂs situation, it would wait until the issue manifested a genuine problem and would, in the meantime, consider alternative solutions. On December 13, the trial court discussed with counsel an instruction that it might give to the jury to the effect that it should feel no pressure in its deliberations and that, if necessary, the trial court would suspend deliberations until Blackwood returned from his vacation. After discussing such an instruction with counsel, the court stated that later that day it would instruct the jury on the subject of BlackwoodÃ¢ÂÂs vacation plans. Before the court determined a propitious moment to instruct the jury, however, the jury had reached a verdict.
Ã¢ÂÂ[A] mistrial should be granted only as a result of some occurrence upon the trial of such a character that it is apparent to the court that because of it a party cannot have a fair trial . . . and the whole proceedings are vitiated.Ã¢ÂÂ (Internal quotation marks omitted.) State v. Weinberg, 215 Conn. 231, 250, 575 A.2d 1003, cert. denied, 498 U.S. 967, 111 S. Ct. 430, 112 L. Ed. 2d 413 (1990); State v. Cruz, 212 Conn. 351, 364, 562 *87A.2d 1071 (1989); State v. Ubaldi, 190 Conn. 559, 562, 462 A.2d 1001, cert. denied, 464 U.S. 916, 104 S. Ct. 280, 78 L. Ed. 2d 259 (1983). Ã¢ÂÂA determination of whether a mistrial is warranted is left to the sound judgment and discretion of the trial judge. State v. Gaston, [198 Conn. 490, 496, 503 A.2d 1157 (1986)].Ã¢ÂÂ State v. Hill, 201 Conn. 505, 510-11, 523 A.2d 1252 (1986); see State v. Marra, 215 Conn. 716, 731-32, 579 A.2d 9 (1990). Ã¢ÂÂA motion for mistrial is a drastic remedy, granted only when some event has occurred that is so prejudicial it precludes a fair trial.Ã¢ÂÂ (Internal quotation marks omitted.) State v. Willis, 24 Conn. App. 678, 684, 591 A.2d 445 (1991), aff'd, 221 Conn. 518, 605 A.2d 1359 (1992). On appeal, the defendant bears the burden of establishing that there was irreparable prejudice to the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs case such that it denied him a fair trial. State v. Cruz, supra, 365.
Ã¢ÂÂDue process seeks to assure a defendant a fair trial, not a perfect one.Ã¢ÂÂ State v. Kurvin, 186 Conn. 555, 565, 442 A.2d 1327 (1982). Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ[T]he constitution Ã¢ÂÂdoes not require a new trial every time a juror has been placed in a potentially compromising situation . . . [because] it is virtually impossible to shield jurors from every contact or influence that might theoretically affect their vote.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ State v. Rodriguez, 210 Conn. 315, 329, 554 A.2d 1080 (1989). Here, the trial court, having carefully observed the jury throughout the trial, decided that it would be premature and possibly counterproductive to advise the jury regarding BlackwoodÃ¢ÂÂs vacation plans before the issue presented a real problem to ongoing jury deliberations. Moreover, throughout the juryÃ¢ÂÂs deliberations, the trial court agreed to accommodate the defendant by reinstructing the jury on the need for careful, considerate deliberations, or by suggesting to the jurors that they should not proceed in haste. Finally, there is simply no evidence to suggest that BlackwoodÃ¢ÂÂs upcoming vacation in any way influenced the jury or *88prejudiced the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs right to a fair trial. The trial court in fact noted that on the morning of the day the jury returned its verdict, December 13,1991, the jury appeared to be under no pressure.
We conclude that the trial court acted properly within its discretion by determining that BlackwoodÃ¢ÂÂs vacation plans had not presented a problem sufficient to grant the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs motion to advise the jury specifically that BlackwoodÃ¢ÂÂs vacation plans should have no impact on their deliberations. The trial court also acted well within its discretion in denying the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs motion for a mistrial. The defendantÃ¢ÂÂs claims to the contrary are without merit.
V
The defendantÃ¢ÂÂs penultimate claim is that the trial court violated the protections guaranteed by the fifth, sixth and fourteenth amendments to the constitution of the United States and article first, ÃÂ§ 8 of the Connecticut constitution when it improperly refused to instruct the jury on his theory of defense. He argues that a Ã¢ÂÂcriminal defendant is entitled to have instructions presented relating to any theory of defense for which there is any foundation in the evidence, no matter how weak or incredible that evidence might be.Ã¢ÂÂ United States v. OÃ¢ÂÂConnor, 237 F.2d 466, 474 n.8 (2d Cir. 1956); State v. Fuller, 199 Conn. 273, 278, 506 A.2d 556 (1986). His emphasis is misplaced.
Ã¢ÂÂWhen a defendant admits the commission of the crime charged but seeks to excuse or justify its commission so that legal responsibility for the act is avoided, a theory of defense charge is appropriate. A defendant must, however, assert a recognized legal defense before such a charge will become obligatory. A claim of innocence or a denial of participation in the crime charged is not a legally recognized defense and *89does not entitle a defendant to a theory of defense charge.Ã¢ÂÂ State v. Rosado, 178 Conn. 704, 707, 425 A.2d 108 (1979).
The defendant submitted a written request to charge concerning his theory that an intruder broke into the house and murdered his wife. His evidentiary support for the request included testimony concerning the cut screen, open windows, and stereo equipment stacked on the desk by an open window. The defendant does not identify, however, any specific legally recognized defense that the trial court should have included in its charge. Upon review of the entire charge in this case, we conclude that the instruction given squarely placed before the jury the stateÃ¢ÂÂs obligation to prove beyond a reasonable doubt each and every element of the crime charged. We, therefore, reject this claim of the defendant.
VI
The defendant claims finally that the trial court improperly denied his motion to dismiss and for a mistrial on the ground that the state failed timely to disclose to the defense exculpatory information in violation of the fifth, sixth and fourteenth amendments to the constitution of the United States and article first, ÃÂ§ 8 of the Connecticut constitution. Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S. Ct. 1194, 10 L. Ed. 2d 215 (1963). We disagree.
Prior to trial, the defendant filed a motion for disclosure seeking, inter alia, Ã¢ÂÂ[a]ll evidence that supports the position that another person had a motive to commit the homicide or did in fact commit the homicide.Ã¢ÂÂ At trial, the defense called Angelina Gialluca, an employee of the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs dog grooming business. She testified that prior to and after the date of the murder she received, at the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs business establishment, telephone calls from an unidentified male caller *90who asked for the defendant. The defendant claims that he learned about these calls for the first time at trial although the state had been in possession of the witnessÃ¢ÂÂ statement since the date of the murder. The transcript of GiallucaÃ¢ÂÂs testimony on both direct and cross-examination reveals, however, that Gialluca told the defendant about the calls at the time that they were received. After Gialluca testified, the defendant moved to dismiss and for a mistrial because of the stateÃ¢ÂÂs failure timely to disclose information concerning the telephone calls. Prior knowledge of this information, he argues, would have allowed him to investigate the identity of the caller and could possibly have shown that the caller may have been the murderer.
We have long recognized the common-law duty of the prosecutor Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂto ensure that all evidence tending to aid in ascertaining the truth be laid before the court, even though such evidence is not consistent with the prosecutionÃ¢ÂÂs contention that the accused is guilty.Ã¢ÂÂ State v. Brown, 169 Conn. 692, 696, 364 A.2d 186 (1975) . . . .Ã¢ÂÂ State v. Reddick, 197 Conn. 115, 129, 496 A.2d 466 (1985), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 1067, 106 S. Ct. 822, 88 L. Ed. 2d 795 (1986). Moreover, Ã¢ÂÂ[t]he state is constitutionally obligated to disclose certain information to a defendant. The principles of due process require the prosecution to disclose exculpatory evidence that is material to a defendantÃ¢ÂÂs guilt or punishment. Brady v. Maryland, supra, 87.Ã¢ÂÂ State v. Simms, 201 Conn. 395, 405, 518 A.2d 35 (1986). Ã¢ÂÂIn order to prove a Brady violation, the defendant must show: (1) that the prosecution suppressed evidence after a request by the defense; (2) that the evidence was favorable to the defense; and (3) that the evidence was material. Moore v. Illinois, 408 U.S. 786, 794-95, 92 S. Ct. 2562, 33 L. Ed. 2d 706, reh. denied, 409 U.S. 897, 93 S. Ct. 87, 34 L. Ed. 2d 155 (1972).Ã¢ÂÂ State v. Simms, supra; State *91v. Shannon, 212 Conn. 387, 398, 563 A.2d 646, cert. denied, 493 U.S. 980, 110 S. Ct. 510, 107 L. Ed. 2d 512 (1989).
The defendantÃ¢ÂÂs reliance on Brady is misplaced. Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ[EJvidence known to the defendant or his counsel, or that is disclosed, even if during trial, is not considered suppressed as that term is used in Brady. . . . Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ (Citations omitted; emphasis added and omitted.) State v. Walker, 214 Conn. 122, 126, 571 A.2d 686 (1990); State v. Dolphin, 195 Conn. 444, 455-56, 488 A.2d 812, cert. denied, 474 U.S. 833, 106 S. Ct. 103, 88 L. Ed. 2d 84 (1985). Ã¢ÂÂThe purpose of criminal discovery is to prevent surprise and to afford the parties a reasonable opportunity to prepare for trial.Ã¢ÂÂ State v. Festo, 181 Conn. 254, 265, 435 A.2d 38 (1980). Evidence not disclosed to a defendant prior to trial is not suppressed if the defendant had personal knowledge of the evidence. Moreover, the evidence complained of was not suppressed but was elicited at trial. State v. Perez, 181 Conn. 299, 309, 435 A.2d 334 (1980).
Ã¢ÂÂThe defendant, therefore, has no basis for a claim of suppression. He can complain only of the timing of the disclosure.Ã¢ÂÂ State v. Walker, supra, citing State v. Reddick, supra, 121. Ã¢ÂÂUnder such circumstances the defendant bears the burden of proving that he was prejudiced by the failure of the state to make [GiallucaÃ¢ÂÂs] information available to him at an earlier time.Ã¢ÂÂ State v. Walker, supra, 126-27; see State v. Reddick, supra, 121-22. This he has failed to do.
As to the second prong of Brady, the defendant failed to show that the evidence was favorable to his defense. The defendant merely asserts that the caller might be the murderer. Without more, however, his claim that he was prejudiced by the withholding of favorable evidence is purely speculative and is not a basis for a new trial. State v. Miner, 197 Conn. 298, 305, 497 A.2d 382 (1985); State v. Reddick, supra, 122.
*92Furthermore, Ã¢ÂÂevidence is material only if there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A Ã¢ÂÂreasonable probabilityÃ¢ÂÂ is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.Ã¢ÂÂ United States v. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667, 682, 105 S. Ct. 3375, 87 L. Ed. 2d 481 (1985); State v. Shannon, supra, 399; State v. Pollitt, 205 Conn. 132, 149, 531 A.2d 125 (1987). Ã¢ÂÂThe determination of materiality has been said to be Ã¢ÂÂinevitably fact-boundÃ¢ÂÂ and like other factual issues is committed to the trial court in the first instance.Ã¢ÂÂ State v. Pollitt, supra, 147. We are not persuaded that information about the telephone calls was either favorable to the defendant or material to the issue of his guilt or innocence so as Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂto undermine confidence in the outcome.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ State v. John, 210 Conn. 652, 669, 557 A.2d 93, cert. denied, 493 U.S. 824, 110 S. Ct. 84, 107 L. Ed. 2d 50 (1989). Accordingly, we conclude that the defendant has not demonstrated the prejudice that would furnish a basis for the reversal of his conviction.
The judgment is affirmed.
In this opinion Peters, C. J., Norcott and F. X. Hennessy, Js., concurred.

 General Statutes ÃÂ§ 53a-54a provides in relevant part: Ã¢ÂÂ(a) A person is guilty of murder when, with intent to cause the death of another person, he causes the death of such person . . . .Ã¢ÂÂ


 When he had dressed, the defendant had not put on a shirt and continued to wear his robe over his other clothes.


 Malka Shah, assistant state medical examiner, testified concerning the differences between types of wounds. A stab wound is small on the skin and deep within the soft tissue. An incised wound is longer on the skin than it is deep in the skin itself. Both are caused by a sharp-edged object.


 Shah further testified that defense wounds, such as those on the victimÃ¢ÂÂs left hand, are sustained by victims who are Ã¢ÂÂtrying to ward [off] the instrument which is coming towards them. They get the injuries on their palm or outer part of the hands ... in defending from the object itself . . . .Ã¢ÂÂ The wound on the right hand could be attributed to an attempt by the victim Ã¢ÂÂto grab the object which is coming towards her . . . .Ã¢ÂÂ


 The jury heard expert testimony that pressure to the neck or chest results in a sudden increase in blood pressure that causes small capillaries to rupture.


 Vincent DiMaio, the chief medical examiner for Bexar County, Texas, was called by the defense and testified on cross-examination:
Ã¢ÂÂQ. You feel that she was strangled but that strangulation did not cause her death?
Ã¢ÂÂA. Right, because the stab woundsÃ¢ÂÂshe wasÃ¢ÂÂshe was still alive when she was stabbed, and the strangulation had to occur before the stab wounds of the neck. . . .
Ã¢ÂÂQ. A person wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt even have to be rendered unconscious to have petechial hemorrhages]?]
Ã¢ÂÂA. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs correct. . . . [I]f the pressure was intermittent, that is if you blocked [the carotid arteries in the neck] and then released it and then blocked it and released it, and it was sufficient so that the pressure would build up at points, you would, yes.Ã¢ÂÂ


 DiMaio further testified concerning the source of the blood on the victim based upon his review of autopsy reports and photographs:
Ã¢ÂÂA. My opinion and the most likely source of the blood is that, as I said before ... she was strangled and then she was attacked. . . . [S]he was conscious when she was stabbed in the neck. And thatÃ¢ÂÂs shown by the fact that sheÃ¢ÂÂs got defense injuries.
* * *
Ã¢ÂÂQ. Okay. Now what is it that makes you say Loreli Rasmussen . . . was conscious when she was lying on the floor before being stabbed?
Ã¢ÂÂA. [F]irst of all, she has defense wounds on the right and left hands. . . .
Ã¢ÂÂQ. And what type of instrument appeared to have caused those cuts?
Ã¢ÂÂA. An instrument with a sharp edge.Ã¢ÂÂ


 The defendant testified that they had had sexual relations for forty-five minutes and then had gotten up and stripped the bed. The victim put the sheets in the washer while the defendant put clean sheets on the bed. The defendant testified that he and the victim then had gotten back into bed and had gone to sleep.


 The fifth amendment to the United States constitution provides in relevant part: Ã¢ÂÂNo person shall be . . . deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law . . . .Ã¢ÂÂ The fifth amendment is applicable to state criminal prosecutions by virtue of the fourteenth amendment. Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U.S. 1, 84 S. Ct. 1489, 12 L. Ed. 2d 653 (1964).
The sixth amendment to the United States constitution provides in relevant part: Ã¢ÂÂIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury . . . and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the assistance of counsel for his defense.Ã¢ÂÂ The sixth amendment applies to state criminal proceedings by virtue of the fourteenth amendment. Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 83 S. Ct. 792, 9 L. Ed. 2d 799 (1963).
Article first, ÃÂ§ 8 of the Connecticut constitution provides in pertinent part: Ã¢ÂÂIn all criminal prosecutions [by indictment or information], the accused shall have a right ... to a speedy, public trial by an impartial jury. No person shall be compelled to give evidence against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law . . . .Ã¢ÂÂ


 General Statutes ÃÂ§ 53a-55 (a) provides in relevant part: Ã¢ÂÂA person is guilty of manslaughter in the first degree when: (1) With intent to cause *64serious physical injury to another person, he causes the death of such person or of a third person ... or (3) under circumstances evincing an extreme indifference to human life, he recklessly engages in conduct which creates a grave risk of death to another person, and thereby causes the death of another person.Ã¢ÂÂ
The trial court did not instruct on manslaughter in the first degree delineated in ÃÂ§ 53a-55 (a) (2). The defendant does not claim that such an instruction would have been appropriate in this case.
General Statutes ÃÂ§ 53a-56 (a) provides in relevant part: Ã¢ÂÂA person is guilty of manslaughter in the second degree when: (1) He recklessly causes the death of another person . . . .Ã¢ÂÂ


 As to the second condition of Whistnant, Ã¢ÂÂthis court has often reaffirmed that manslaughter in the first and second degrees and criminally negligent homicide are lesser included offenses within the crime of murder.Ã¢ÂÂ State v. Edwards, 214 Conn. 57, 63, 570 A.2d 193 (1990).


 As to the first condition of the Whistnant test, a proposed instruction on a lesser included offense must comply with requirements of Practice Book ÃÂ§ 854. State v. Hall, 213 Conn. 579, 590-93, 569 A.2d 534 (1990); State v. Ostroski, 201 Conn. 534, 556-58, 518 A.2d 915 (1986); State v. McIntosh, 199 Conn. 155, 158, 506 A.2d 104 (1986). In its brief, the state argued that the defendant had not complied with this condition because the record was devoid of any evidence to support the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs request. At oral argument, however, the state appeared to merge its evidentiary arguments related to the first condition into those related to the third condition. We assume, for purposes of this analysis only, that the first condition has been satisfied. Because we hold that the defendant did not meet the third condition, we need neither to titrate the stateÃ¢ÂÂs evidentiary arguments to identify those related to the first condition nor to address the fourth condition.


 See footnote 10.


 Shah testified similarly.


 In his reply brief, the defendant correctly argues that the jury could have disregarded expert testimony that the victim was conscious at the time of the stabbings. He then charts the tortuous course that the jury would have had to have navigated through the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs pathologistÃ¢ÂÂs testimony to find that the victim was unconscious or dead when stabbed. The jurors would have simultaneously had to have: discredited DiMaioÃ¢ÂÂs testimony that the victim was conscious when stabbed; credited his testimony that the presence of petechiae are normally associated with death by strangulation; and discredited, however, his very next answer that Ã¢ÂÂshe didnÃ¢ÂÂt die of the strangling.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ[Tjaking all this evidence in the light most favorable to the defendant, the jury could not reasonably have concluded that the defendant acted recklessly, rather than intentionally, with respect to [the victimÃ¢ÂÂs] death.Ã¢ÂÂ State v. Montanez, 219 Conn. 16, 24, 592 A.2d 149 (1991).


 In Colorado v. Connelly, 479 U.S. 157, 163-64, 107 S. Ct. 515, 93 L. Ed. 2d 473 (1986), the United States Supreme Court ruled that the only question in determining whether there has been a waiver of a defendantÃ¢ÂÂs Miranda rights is whether there was police coercion or overreaching. Although we agree with the trial court that there was no police coercion or overreaching, we do not here decide whether the Connecticut constitution continues to require an inquiry into the totality of the circumstances. See State v. Northrop, 213 Conn. 405, 419-20, 568 A.2d 439 (1990).


 The fourth amendment to the United States constitution provides: Ã¢ÂÂThe right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.Ã¢ÂÂ The United States Supreme Court has held that the fourth amendmentÃ¢ÂÂs prohibition against the use of evidence obtained as the result of an illegal search is applicable to the states through the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution. See Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643, 81 S. Ct. 1684, 6 L. Ed. 2d 1081, reh. denied, 368 U.S. 871, 82 S. Ct. 23, 7 L. Ed. 2d 72 (1961).
Article first, ÃÂ§ 7, of the Connecticut constitution provides: Ã¢ÂÂThe people shall be secure in their persons, houses, papers and possessions from unreasonable searches or seizures; and no warrant to search any place, or to seize any person or things, shall issue without describing them as nearly as may be, nor without probable cause supported by oath or affirmation.Ã¢ÂÂ


 The other two questions asked by the jury are irrelevant to the issue under consideration.

Berdon, J.,
dissenting. I believe that the narrow view taken by the majority on when a person charged with murder is entitled to have the jury consider lesser degrees of homicide has deprived the defendant of his common law, statutory and constitutional rights.
The defendant in this case was charged with the intentional murder of his wife. He sought to have the jury instructed on the lesser included offenses of manslaughter in the first and second degrees. Manslaughter in the first degree, as far as it is applicable here, requires that the defendant cause death either with *93Ã¢ÂÂintent to cause serious physical injury,Ã¢ÂÂ or through reckless conduct engaged in Ã¢ÂÂunder circumstances evincing an extreme indifference to human life.Ã¢ÂÂ General Statutes ÃÂ§ 53a-55d Manslaughter in the second degree requires that the defendant Ã¢ÂÂrecklesslyÃ¢ÂÂ cause death. General Statutes ÃÂ§ 53a-56.1
2 These degrees of homicide are differentiated by gradations in the culpability of a personÃ¢ÂÂs state of mindÃ¢ÂÂthat is, intent to kill versus recklessly causing death.
Determining a personÃ¢ÂÂs state of mind is a difficult matter that usually depends upon inferences. Ã¢ÂÂThe state of mind of one accused of a crime is often the most significant and, at the same time, the most elusive element of the crime charged. This is especially true where a person has caused the death of another person. The death of a person may be caused by a purely accidental act or omission of another, from which no criminal liability may result, or it may come about as the result of long and careful planning, for which the law prescribes severe penalties. Because it is practically impossible to know what someone is thinking or intending at any given moment, absent an outright declaration of intent, a personÃ¢ÂÂs state of mind is usually proved by circumstantial evidence . . . and is, except in rare cases, a question of fact.Ã¢ÂÂ (Citation omitted.) State v. Rodriguez, 180 Conn. 382, 404, 429 A.2d 919 (1980). For that precise reason, this court in State v. Falby, 187 Conn. 6, 444 A.2d 213 (1982), reversed a murder conviction because the trial court refused to instruct on lesser included homicides. Ã¢ÂÂSince we cannot as a matter of law exclude this possibility, [i.e., that the defendant committed the homicide with less culpability than intent to cause death,] the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury as requested on the lesser included offenses of manslaughter in the second degree and criminally negligent homicide.Ã¢ÂÂ Id., 30.
*94Failure to instruct on the lesser degrees of homicide leaves the jury in what could be a dilemma: they must either set the defendant free even though they find that he did criminally cause the victimÃ¢ÂÂs death, or convict him of intentional homicide. Ã¢ÂÂSuch a result . . . limit[s] the juryÃ¢ÂÂs function of determining questions of fact and undermine[s] a defendantÃ¢ÂÂs right to a trial by jury.Ã¢ÂÂ State v. Rodriguez, supra, 404.
The United States Supreme Court in a capital case recognized this problem of human frailty and reasoned that Ã¢ÂÂthe unavailability of the option . . . of convicting on a lesser included offense may encourage the jury to convict for an impermissible reasonÃ¢ÂÂits belief that the defendant is guilty of some serious crime and should be punished.Ã¢ÂÂ Beck v. Alabama, 447 U.S. 625, 642,100 S. Ct. 2382, 65 L. Ed. 2d 392 (1980). In addition, our own legislature has made clear that a defendant charged with murder has a statutory right to instructions on lesser included offenses. General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) ÃÂ§ 53a-45 (c) provides: Ã¢ÂÂThe court or jury before which any person indicted for murder or held to answer for murder after a hearing conducted in accordance with the provisions of section 54-46a is tried may find him guilty of homicide in a lesser degree than that charged.Ã¢ÂÂ
Accordingly, if there is any suggestion that a person charged with murder committed the homicide with a lesser degree of intent, then at his or her request the jury should be instructed on the lesser degrees of homicide. I have long been under the impression that this was our law, at least since State v. Rodriguez, supra.
Nevertheless, in this case, even if we should travel the route charted by the majority and require Ã¢ÂÂsufficientÃ¢ÂÂ evidence, I would still conclude that the defendant was entitled to his requested instruction. The majority points out that the requirements of State v. *95Whistnant, 179 Conn. 576, 427 A.2d 414 (1980), are superimposed on ÃÂ§ 53a-45 (c) and must be met in order for a party to be entitled to an instruction on lesser included offenses. See State v. Rodriquez, supra, 399-407.
The majority focuses on the third prong of State v. Whistnant, supra, 588Ã¢ÂÂthat is, there must be Ã¢ÂÂsome evidence . . . which justifies conviction of the lesser offenseÃ¢ÂÂ3Ã¢ÂÂto uphold the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs refusal to instruct on the lesser included offenses of manslaughter in the first and second degrees. After Ã¢ÂÂclarifyingÃ¢ÂÂ that under this prong Ã¢ÂÂsomeÃ¢ÂÂ evidence means Ã¢ÂÂsufficientÃ¢ÂÂ evidence, the majority holds that there was not enough evidence of the lesser included homicides to entitle the defendant to the instruction he sought. This is simply not the case for several reasons.
First, the fact that the victim was strangled suggests that the defendant may not have intended to cause her death. The majority tacitly concedes that the defendant would have been entitled to the requested instructions if there was evidence from which the jury could conclude that the strangulation rendered the victim unconscious and that she was still unconscious when the fatal neck and chest wounds were inflicted.4 There *96is evidence in the record that the strangulation could have rendered the victim unconscious,5 and the majority does not take issue with this. The majority concludes, however, that the victim must have been conscious when the later neck and chest injuries were inflicted since there were defensive injuries on her hands. This, however, only proves that the victim was conscious when the defensive injuries were inflicted. My reading of the record discloses nothing that would prevent a jury from finding that the defensive injuries occurred prior to the attempted strangulation, while the neck and chest wounds were inflicted afterward. In other words, there is nothing in the evidence that would prevent the jurors from concluding that the defensive injuries to the victimÃ¢ÂÂs hands were inflicted first, followed by strangulation that rendered her unconscious and, after that, by the fatal wounds to the neck and chest.6
*97Second, as the state concedes, there is no evidence of a motive on the part of the defendant to kill his wife. Although the state need not prove motive, Ã¢ÂÂthe Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂpresence or absence of motive ... is a circumstance to be weighed with other evidence for the jury to consider.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ (Emphasis added.) State v. Ruffin, 206 Conn. 678, 681, 539 A.2d 144 (1988); State v. Annunziato, 169 Conn. 517, 530, 363 A.2d 1011 (1975).Ã¢ÂÂ State v. Pinnock, 220 Conn. 765, 790, 601 A.2d 521 (1992). In Pinnock, this court held that where there is no evidence of a motive to commit an intentional crime, the defendant is entitled to a jury instruction that lack of motive may tend to raise a reasonable doubt. Id., 791-92. The majority claims that lack of motive is not particularly relevant to the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs state of mind because the jury could find both a lack of motive and an intent to kill. Common sense, however, compels the conclusion that although the lack of a motive does not preclude a finding of intent to kill, the jury could reasonably infer from lack of a motive that the defendant did not intend to kill the victim but rather acted with a less culpable mindÃ¢ÂÂthat is, recklessly or with an intent to injure.
Third, there was evidence that the defendant and the victim argued the night of the crime over the planning of the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs birthday party, and that the defendant was under extreme pressure to complete house renovations before the party. The majority concludes that these facts are not relevant Ã¢ÂÂviewed in the context of the circumstances of the victimÃ¢ÂÂs death.Ã¢ÂÂ The majority, again, seems to be relying on its assumption that the victim was conscious at the time the fatal wounds were inflicted to conclude that evidence of how the incident got started is irrelevant to the issue of whether the defendant intended to kill his wife. Similarly, with regard to the fourth area of evidenceÃ¢ÂÂthe cover-upÃ¢ÂÂthe majority dismisses this evidence as irrelevant because it assumes that the victim was conscious *98when the fatal injuries were inflicted. As pointed out above, there was nothing in the evidence to preclude the jury from accepting the scenario that the victim received the defensive wounds prior to the strangulation.
Surely, these four areas provide evidence upon which the jury could have reasonably concluded that, when the incident leading to death started, the defendant did not necessarily intend to kill his wife. The jury in this case should have been given the option of deciding whether the victim was conscious when the fatal injuries were inflicted, and whether the defendant acted with the intent to kill or with a less culpable state of mind. No one can know for certain what happened, and while expert testimony is helpful, the jury may disregard it entirely if it chooses. See Mather v. Griffin Hospital, 207 Conn. 125, 145, 540 A.2d 666 (1988) (Ã¢ÂÂ[t]he jury is under no obligation to credit the evidence proffered by any witnesses, including experts . . . even if that evidence is uncontrovertedÃ¢ÂÂ); Johnson v. Fuller, 190 Conn. 552, 556, 461 A.2d 988 (1983) (Ã¢ÂÂa trier is not required to believe testimony merely because it is not directly contradicted . . . nor is the trier bound by the opinions of expertsÃ¢ÂÂ). Deciding issues of intent as a matter of law in such cases invades the province of the jury.
What is particularly troubling to me is that, if the jury had been instructed on lesser homicides at the request of the state or the defendant and had found the defendant guilty of manslaughter, I am positive that the majority would have upheld the conviction. It is inconceivable that this court would have ordered the trial court to render a judgment of not guilty7 if this defendant had been convicted of manslaughter, since *99there is sufficient evidence to support an intentional homicide. These two offenses are distinguishable merely by a less culpable state of mind. Therefore, the evidence is Ã¢ÂÂsufficientÃ¢ÂÂ to justify a conviction of manslaughter and the defendant should have received the instruction he requested.
Judge Cardozo, writing for a unanimous New York Court of Appeals, summed up the issue of intent when reversing a murder conviction for failure to instruct the jury on a lesser included offense as follows: Ã¢ÂÂWhenever intent becomes material, its quality and persistenceÃ¢ÂÂ the deranging influence of fear or sudden impulse or feebleness of mind or willÃ¢ÂÂis [a] matter for the jury if such emotions or disabilities can conceivably have affected the thought or purpose of the actor.Ã¢ÂÂ People v. Moran, 246 N.Y. 100, 103, 158 N.E. 35 (1927). I believe that, where intent is at issue, any evidence suggesting a less culpable state of mind is sufficient to satisfy the third prong of State v. Whistnant, supra, 588, and justify instructions on lesser included offenses.
In sum, I would hold that the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury on the lesser included offenses. I would therefore reverse the conviction on this ground and order a new trial.8

 See footnote 10 of the majority opinion.


 See footnote 10 of the majority opinion.


 The majority assumes that the first prong has been satisfied, and I agree. See footnote 12 of the majority opinion. The second prong has also been satisfied. See footnote 11 of the majority opinion. The majority does not reach the fourth prong, which requires that Ã¢ÂÂthe proof on the element or elements which differentiate the lesser offense from the offense charged is sufficiently in dispute to permit the jury consistently to find the defendant innocent of the greater offense but guilty of the lesser.Ã¢ÂÂ State v. Whistnant, 179 Conn. 576, 588, 427 A.2d 414 (1980). The differentiating element between murder and manslaughter is the state of mind of the defendant-intent to kill versus recklessness or intent to injure. As I indicate in my analysis of the third prong, infra, there is ample evidence in this case that the defendant may have acted recklessly or with intent to injure without the intent to kill required for murder. Therefore, this prong need not be considered separately.


 On page 72 of its opinion, the majority states: Ã¢ÂÂThe defendantÃ¢ÂÂs theory . . . fails because of the complete lack of evidence that the victim *96was strangled into unconsciousness before she was killed. . . . [T]he evidence in the record compelled the jury, if it found the defendant was the perpetrator, to find that he had intended to kill his wife.Ã¢ÂÂ


 The defense pathologist testified that strangulation could cause unconsciousness in ten to fifteen seconds, and that the victim may well have been strangled for a longer period of time. There is certainly nothing in the record to preclude the jury from concluding that the strangulation, which was sufficient to cause petechial hemorrhages, rendered the victim unconscious. Indeed, the defense pathologist testified that it may take one minute or more for strangulation to cause such hemorrhages.


 For example, the jury could have found that the defendant and his wife got into an argument and that the defendant recklessly assaulted his wife with a knife. The wife sustained some defensive wounds to her hands and then knocked the knife away from the defendant. Angered at this, the defendant hit his wife and then choked her until she lost consciousness. Though he did not intend to kill his wife, the defendant mistook her unconscious state for death and attempted to cover up his crime. To do this, he covered up the strangulation marks on her neck by cutting her with a sharp instrument and stabbed her with a homemade spear to make it look like a maniac burglar had committed the crime. These injuries to the neck and chest actually caused the wifeÃ¢ÂÂs death. My point is not that this is the more likely scenario, but that it is a possible scenario.


 When Ã¢ÂÂa defendant is convicted of a lesser offense than that charged, that conviction is an implicit acquittal on the greater offense.Ã¢ÂÂ State v. Rodriguez, 180 Conn. 382, 398-99, 429 A.2d 919 (1980).


 I agree with parts II and III of the majority opinion and would not reach the issues in parts IV, V and VI.

Peters, C. J.
The issue in this appeal is whether, in the circumstances of this case, the Appellate Court correctly concluded that the trial court had not abused its discretion by refusing to open a judgment of strict *107foreclosure despite the negotiation of a settlement agreement between the foreclosing creditor and the debtors. The plaintiff, Society for Savings, brought an action to foreclose a mortgage on real estate owned jointly by the defendants Carmine S. Stramaglia and Patricia R. Stramaglia. The trial court, Pickett, J., rendered a judgment of strict foreclosure. After various sets of law days had been established, superseded and then set again by the trial court, Moraghan, J., the trial court, Dranginis, J., denied the motion of the defendant Carmine S. Stramaglia to open the judgment because of objections raised by the defendant Thomas Ackerson, a creditor with a judgment lien against Carmine S. StramagliaÃ¢ÂÂs one-half interest in the property. Carmine S. Stramaglia appealed to the Appellate Court, which affirmed the judgment of the trial court. Society for Savings v. Stramaglia, 25 Conn. App. 688, 596 A.2d 20 (1991). We granted his petition for certification to appeal and now reverse.1
The facts are undisputed. On November 14,1980, the Stramaglias signed a promissory note evidencing their indebtedness to the plaintiff in the amount of $68,700. The note was secured by a properly recorded mortgage on certain real estate in Torrington. As a result of defaults on the mortgage note, the plaintiff commenced foreclosure proceedings against the Stramaglias on November 21, 1988.
In its foreclosure complaint, the plaintiff gave proper notice to Ackerson, who, on September 1, 1987, had recorded on the Torrington land records a judgment lien arising out of a default judgment against Carmine S. Stramaglia that Ackerson had obtained in New *108York in 1983.2 AckersonÃ¢ÂÂs judgment lien, which attached to Carmine S. StramagliaÃ¢ÂÂs undivided one-half interest in the property, is junior to the plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs lien. In 1987, one year prior to the plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs foreclosure action, Ackerson had initiated, but had not pursued, his own foreclosure proceedings against Carmine S. StramagliaÃ¢ÂÂs interest in the property. See Ackerson v. Stramaglia, 225 Conn. 102, 621 A.2d 1315 (1993).
On March 20, 1989, the trial court, Pickett, J., granted the plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs motion for a judgment of strict foreclosure after the Stramaglias, appearing pro se, had been defaulted for failure to plead. The court fixed the debt at $67,506.55 and set law days commencing April 17, 1989.
On April 15, 1989, two days before the first of the law days, the Stramaglias filed a chapter thirteen petition in bankruptcy in New Jersey, resulting in the automatic stay of the foreclosure proceedings. See 11 U.S.C. ÃÂ§ 362 (a). At the instance of the plaintiff, the bankruptcy court, on September 14,1989, vacated the stay of the foreclosure proceedings involved in this case. Once the stay had been lifted, the plaintiff renewed its motion for a judgment of foreclosure, and, on October 16, 1989, the trial court, Moraghan, J., rendered a judgment of strict foreclosure that found that the Stramaglias owed an amended debt in the amount of $74,258.21 and set new law days to begin on November 7, 1989.
On November 3,1989, Carmine S. Stramaglia, now represented by counsel, moved to open the judgment of strict foreclosure. At the trial court hearing on the *109motion, Carmine S. Stramaglia represented to the court that the plaintiff joined in his motion, that the plaintiff had agreed to reinstate the mortgage upon receiving certain payments that were in hand and that the plaintiff was therefore prepared to withdraw the action once the judgment had been opened. Without challenging the accuracy of this representation, Ackerson objected to the motion to open. He argued that Carmine S. Stramaglia had engaged in improper delaying tactics that had impaired AckersonÃ¢ÂÂs ability to liquidate his lien interest in the Torrington property.
The trial court, Dranginis, J., denied the motion to open as well as a subsequent motion to reargue. Acceding to the objections raised by Ackerson, the court stated that Ã¢ÂÂ[Carmine S. Stramaglia] has already created great delay by not securing counsel until the eleventh hour and has engaged in an effort to delay this action by proceeding in Bankruptcy Court just prior to the April law days. Such dilatory tactics will not be rewarded by the court.Ã¢ÂÂ
A divided Appellate Court held that the trial court had reasonably exercised its discretion to deny the motion to open the judgment of foreclosure in light of the substantial delays engendered by Carmine S. Stramaglia. Society for Savings v. Stramaglia, supra, 691. Judge Cretella, in his dissent, concluded that the equitable considerations that govern foreclosure actions made it inappropriate, in the circumstances of this case, for the trial court to give greater weight to the interests of a junior judicial lien holder such as Ackerson than to the interests of the Stramaglias in a successful workout of their mortgage debt with the foreclosing mortgagee. Id., 692-93.
Appellate review of a trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs denial of a motion to open a foreclosure judgment under General Statutes *110ÃÂ§ 49-153 is governed by two principles. Because the statute vests discretion in the trial court to grant or to deny a motion to open such a judgment, the action of the trial court will not be disturbed on appeal unless it clearly appears that the trial court has abused its discretion. Melillo v. Spiro, 187 Conn. 333, 334, 445 A.2d 921 (1982); Hartford Federal Savings & Loan Assn. v. Stage Harbor Corporation, 181 Conn. 141, 143, 434 A.2d 341 (1980); Sebastiano v. Corde, 171 Conn. 324, 325-26, 370 A.2d 946 (1976); Freccia v. Martin, 163 Conn. 160, 165, 302 A.2d 280 (1972); Stocking v. Ives, 156 Conn. 70, 72, 238 A.2d 421 (1968). Because foreclosure proceedings are equitable and ÃÂ§ 49-15 is remedial in nature, the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs refusal to modify a judgment of foreclosure must, however, be consistent with the authority conferred upon that court Ã¢ÂÂto modify the terms of the judgment in order to achieve an outcome fairer to the parties than provided by the original judgment in light of conditions as they appear when the motion to open is decided. . . . [Ejither a forfeiture or a windfall should be avoided if possible.Ã¢ÂÂ Farmers & Mechanics Savings Bank v. Sullivan, 216 Conn. 341, 352-54, 579 A.2d 1054 (1990); see Kilduff v. Adams, Inc., 219 Conn. 314, 321, 593 A.2d 478 (1991) (the purpose of a ÃÂ§ 49-15 motion is to afford an opportunity to renegotiate with creditors with the view to reinstating a mortgage after default); cf. Fidelity Trust Co. v. Irick, 206 Conn. 484, 488-91, 538 A.2d 1027 (1988) (abuse of discretion to order strict foreclosure rather than foreclosure by sale). Balancing these two principles in the circumstances of this case, we conclude that the trial court abused its discretion.
*111In the cases in which we have affirmed the denial of a motion to open a foreclosure pursuant to ÃÂ§ 49-15 as an appropriate exercise of the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs discretion, the reasons advanced in support of the motion differed significantly from the arguments advanced by Carmine S. Stramaglia in this case. We have found no abuse of discretion when the defendant sought to extend the time period for redemption but did not appear in court, or present evidence, in support of his motion. Maresca v. Allen, 181 Conn. 521, 523, 436 A.2d 14 (1980); Sebastiano v. Corde, supra, 325; see Centerbank v. Connell, 29 Conn. App. 508, 511, 616 A.2d 282 (1992); Pacific Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Broad Associates Limited Partnership, 24 Conn. App. 42, 44, 585 A.2d 115 (1991) (no abuse of discretion in denying an extension when the defendant no longer had any equity in the property). We have similarly found no abuse of discretion when the defendant sought to raise a defense that, but for his own negligence, he could have discovered and presented at the time of the rendition of the foreclosure judgment. Hartford Federal Savings & Loan Assn. v. Stage Harbor Corporation, supra, 144; see Manchester State Bank v. Reale, 172 Conn. 520, 524, 375 A.2d 1009 (1977); Jaquith v. Revson, 159 Conn. 427, 431-32, 270 A.2d 559 (1970). In none of these cases did the defendant ask that the judgment be opened in order to permit the plaintiff to withdraw the foreclosure action and to reinstate the mortgage.
The trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs denial of Carmine S. StramagliaÃ¢ÂÂs motion did not question the plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs acquiescence in the motion or the fact of the settlement between the plaintiff and the Stramaglias. The court focused, instead, on the injury allegedly caused to Ackerson as a judgment lien creditor by the failure to consummate *112the foreclosure. The court found that Carmine S. Stramaglia had improperly engaged in dilatory tactics by not securing counsel Ã¢ÂÂuntil the eleventh hourÃ¢ÂÂ and by proceeding to file a bankruptcy petition just prior to the April law days. We are unpersuaded by this reasoning.
A delay in obtaining professional advice may be a basis for refusing to countenance the belated proffer of a defense that should have been raised at the time of the rendition of the foreclosure judgment. See Hartford Federal Savings & Loan Assn. v. Stage Harbor Corporation, supra; Manchester State Bank v. Reale, supra; Jaquith v. Revson, supra. That is not this case. Whether the earlier intervention of counsel might have allowed a settlement to be negotiated earlier is, on the present record, purely speculative. The record does not show, therefore, that Ackerson was injured by Carmine S. StramagliaÃ¢ÂÂs failure to obtain counsel at the time of the plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs initiation of the foreclosure action.4
Furthermore, recourse to bankruptcy and the concomitant right to an automatic stay of state court proceedings are Ã¢ÂÂfundamental debtor protections provided by the bankruptcy laws. . . . The stay provides a sanctuary from the jungle of creditorsÃ¢ÂÂ pursuit of their individualistic collection efforts in order to safeguard the primary function of the bankruptcy system . . . to continue the law-based orderliness of the open credit economy in the event of a debtorÃ¢ÂÂs inability or unwillingness generally to pay his debts.Ã¢ÂÂ (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Bridgeport v. Debek, 210 Conn. 175, 184-85, 554 A.2d 728 (1989). Exploration of the option to file a chapter thirteen peti*113tion is a legitimate use of the window of opportunity created by the setting of law days some time in the future. See Kilduff v. Adams, Inc., supra.
The delays encountered in this foreclosure proceeding are not, in their totality, so egregious that, standing alone, they justify judicial disregard of an agreement that will allow the Stramaglias to retain their interest in their Torrington real estate. AckersonÃ¢ÂÂs lien arose out of a judgment in New York in 1983 that was not recorded in Connecticut until 1987. Because Ackerson took no steps to pursue the foreclosure action that he filed later that year, there is no basis for his contention that he has been delayed since 1983 by the allegedly dilatory tactics of Carmine S. Stramaglia of which he now complains. At best, Carmine S. StramagliaÃ¢ÂÂs delay in this case relates only to the seven and one-half month period between March 28, 1989, the date of the judgment of foreclosure, and November 7,1989, the date of the motion to open that judgment. A judgment creditor who has himself postponed taking action on foreclosing his lien, and who continues to have available to him the remedies arising out of that delayed action, has not demonstrated such prejudice as would warrant depriving a debtor of the opportunity to reinstate his mortgage.
Section 49-15 is a remedial statute designed to provide relief for property owners Ã¢ÂÂwhen, at the time of the decision upon the motion to open, it appeared that a modification of the terms of the original judgment would produce a more equitable result.Ã¢ÂÂ Farmers & Mechanics Savings Bank v. Sullivan, supra, 352. Ã¢ÂÂThe term Ã¢ÂÂdiscretionÃ¢ÂÂ means a legal discretion to be exercised in conformity with the spirit of the law and in a manner to subserve and not to impede or defeat the ends of substantial justice.Ã¢ÂÂ (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Buckley v. Warden, 181 Conn. 286, 290, 435 *114A.2d 348 (1980). In the circumstances of this case, the Appellate Court should have found an abuse of discretion in the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs refusal to implement the salutary purpose of the statute.
The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed, and the case is remanded to that court with direction to remand the case to the trial court with direction to grant the motion to open and for further proceedings according to law.
In this opinion the other justices concurred.

 We granted certification to appeal limited to the following issue: Ã¢ÂÂIn the circumstances of this case, was it an abuse of discretion to deny the motion to open a judgment of strict foreclosure?Ã¢ÂÂ Society for Savings v. Stramaglia, 220 Conn. 926, 598 A.2d 367 (1991).


 Subsequent to the trial court proceedings in this case, the New York judgment against Carmine S. Stramaglia was vacated by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of New York. See Ackerson v. Stragmaglia, 176 App. Div. 2d 602, 576 N.Y.S.2d 44 (1991); see also Ackerson v. Stramaglia, 225 Conn. 102, 621 A.2d 1315 (1993).


 General Statutes ÃÂ§ 49-15 provides: Ã¢ÂÂopening of judgments of foreclosure. Any judgment foreclosing the title to real estate by strict foreclosure may, at the discretion of the court rendering the same, upon the written motion of any person having an interest therein, and for cause shown, be opened and modified, notwithstanding the limitation imposed *111by section 52-212a, upon such terms as to costs as the court deems reasonable; but no such judgment shall be opened after the title has become absolute in any encumbrancer.Ã¢ÂÂ


 A condition of the proposed reinstatement of the mortgage between the plaintiff and the Stramaglias was the payment of a considerable sum of money. By increasing the debtorsÃ¢ÂÂ equity of redemption, such a payment would have been beneficial to Ackerson, because it would have enhanced his interest as a junior lienor on the property.

Borden, J.
The defendant, John Raguseo, appeals1 from the judgment of conviction, after a jury trial, of murder in violation of General Statutes ÃÂ§ 53a-54a (a).2 The defendant claims that the trial court improperly: (1) denied his motions for a judgment of acquittal and for a new trial because the evidence did not establish that he had the intent to cause the death of the victim; (2) denied his motions for a judgment of acquittal and for a new trial because the evidence established the affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance; (3) instructed the jury regarding the affirmative defense of extreme emotional distress; (4) instructed the jury regarding motive and premeditation; (5) refused to exclude testimony of the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs expert witness regarding the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs consumption of alcohol prior to the crime; (6) allowed the stateÃ¢ÂÂs expert witness to testify to an opinion on the ultimate issue of the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs guilt; and (7) denied the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs motion for a new trial that was based on evidence obtained fol*117lowing the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs commitment to the Whiting Forensic Institute.3 We affirm the judgment of the trial court.
The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. The defendant lived in an apartment building on Clinton Avenue in Norwalk. The apartment building had its own parking lot for its tenants, and each tenant had an assigned parking space. The defendant owned a 1983 Camaro automobile that he parked in the space, and a 1979 Plymouth van that he parked at his motherÃ¢ÂÂs house. He took meticulous care of both vehicles and the parking space at his apartment building. He posted a no parking sign in front of the space, and he often swept the space, painted the lines on either side of the space, and clipped the shrubbery on a nearby fence. Prior to the crime, the defendant had repeatedly complained to the apartment buildingÃ¢ÂÂs superintendent about the unauthorized use of his parking space by the guests of other tenants.
At approximately 12:20 a.m., on June 21,1990, the defendant returned home to find that someone had parked in his space. The defendant parked his vehicle directly behind the automobile in his space so that the *118other automobile could not be moved. The defendant then went inside the building to his apartment. He called 911 to complain that someone had parked in his space but the police informed him that they could not tow the vehicle because it was parked on private property. He also telephoned a friend, Carol Bakinowski, to complain that someone had parked in his space and that he did not know what he would do if Ã¢ÂÂsomeone comes to the door and starts abusing me.Ã¢ÂÂ While they were speaking, Bakinowski could hear a loud banging noise in the background. The defendant told her that he was banging a knife on the kitchen table.
At approximately 2 a.m., the defendant saw from his window that the victim in this case, Philip Iacozza, had parked in his space, and had returned to his automobile and was trying to back out of the parking space. When the defendant saw the victim almost back the automobile into his vehicle, he took the knife and went down to the parking lot.
After a brief verbal exchange, the defendant repeatedly stabbed the victim in the head and torso. The defendant then returned to his apartment and called the police. When police officers arrived, he stated that Ã¢ÂÂhe couldnÃ¢ÂÂt take it any more, that he had done it, and that he was tired of people parking in his parking space.Ã¢ÂÂ The defendant told the officers that they could find the knife with which he had stabbed the victim in the kitchen. The officers then found a blood-stained, eight inch knife in the kitchen sink.
The state charged the defendant in an information with murder in violation of General Statutes ÃÂ§ 53a-54a (a). The defendant at trial did not deny that he had caused IacozzaÃ¢ÂÂs death, but instead claimed that: (1) he did not have the intent to cause the death of Iacozza; (2) he was not guilty because of a mental disease or defect; and (3) he had acted under the influence *119of an extreme emotional disturbance. The jury returned a guilty verdict and the court rendered a judgment on the information. The defendant was then committed to the Whiting Forensic Institute, but later was transferred to the Somers correctional facility.
I
The defendant first claims that the trial court improperly denied his motions for a judgment of acquittal and a new trial because the evidence did not establish that he had the intent to cause the death of the victim. We disagree.
Ã¢ÂÂIn reviewing a sufficiency of the evidence claim, the dispositive question is whether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict, the trier of fact reasonably could have concluded, from the facts established and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom, that the cumulative effect of the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. State v. Famiglietti, 219 Conn. 605, 609, 595 A.2d 306 (1991) . . . .Ã¢ÂÂ State v. Rodriguez, 223 Conn. 127, 146, 613 A.2d 211 (1992). Although Ã¢ÂÂthe jury must find every element proven beyond a reasonable doubt in order to find the defendant guilty of the charged offense, each of the basic and inferred facts underlying those conclusions need not be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. State v. Castonguay, 218 Conn. 486, 507, 590 A.2d 901 (1991). If it is reasonable and logical for the jury to conclude that a basic fact or an inferred fact is true, the jury is permitted to consider the fact proven and may consider it in combination with other proven facts in determining whether the cumulative effect of all the evidence proves the defendant guilty of all the elements of the crime charged beyond a reasonable doubt. State v. Grant, 219 Conn. 596, 604-605, 594 A.2d 459 (1991).Ã¢ÂÂ (Internal quotation marks omitted.) State v. Stanley, 223 Conn. 674, 678, 613 A.2d 788 (1992).
*120The defendant was charged with murder in violation of General Statutes ÃÂ§ 53a-54a. Ã¢ÂÂ Tn order to be convicted under our murder statute, the defendant must possess the specific intent to cause the death of the victim. General Statutes ÃÂ§ 53a-54a. To act intentionally, the defendant must have had the conscious objective to cause the death of the victim. General Statutes ÃÂ§ 53a-3 (11) .... State v. Carpenter, 214 Conn. 77, 82, 570 A.2d 203 (1990). Ordinarily, intent can only be proved by circumstantial evidence; it may be and usually is inferred from the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs conduct. Id. Intent to cause death may be inferred from the type of weapon used, the manner in which it was used, the type of wound inflicted and the events leading to and immediately following the death. ... Id., 82-83 .... Furthermore, it is a permissible, albeit not a necessary or mandatory, inference that a defendant intended the natural consequences of his voluntary conduct. . . . State v. Montanez, 219 Conn. 16, 20, 592 A.2d 149 (1991).Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ State v. Stanley, supra, 678-79.
On the basis of the evidence and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom, the jury could have concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had intended to kill the victim. The defendant had been angry because, upon returning home from work, he discovered a vehicle parked in his parking space. He blocked the victimÃ¢ÂÂs vehicle from leaving and watched the space from the window to see when the driver would return. While waiting, he repeatedly banged the murder weapon against his kitchen table. As soon as he saw the victim, he left his apartment, carrying an eight inch knife, and attacked the victim. He inflicted approximately fifteen stab wounds, most in vital areas of the body. Many of the wounds were deep and reached vital organs of the victim. In light of these facts, we conclude that there was ample evidence from which the jury could have concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had the intent to kill the victim.
*121II
The defendant claims that the trial court improperly-denied his motions for a judgment of acquittal and for a new trial because the evidence established the affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance. We disagree.
Conflicting evidence was introduced at trial regarding the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs mental state both before and after the attack on the victim. Bakinowski testified that she had known the defendant for several years and that he had a history of reacting poorly to unexpected events. She also testified concerning the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs repeated concern about people parking in his space, and his meticulous care of the van and automobile. Finally, she testified that the defendant, prior to the time of the murder, had become increasingly depressed, and that, during the telephone conversation just prior to the attack, he had sounded desperate.
The defendantÃ¢ÂÂs mother testified that her son had had emotional problems for many years, and had been hospitalized on several occasions, including one instance following a suicide attempt. The defendant also elicited testimony from police officers that he had been agitated and upset when they arrived at his apartment shortly after the attack. The defendant also presented his medical records and the testimony of James R. Merikangas, a neurologist and psychiatrist, who had examined the defendant for trial. Merikangas testified that it was his diagnosis that, on June 21, 1990, the defendant suffered from paranoid schizophrenia and that, as a result, the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs thinking was illogical and irrational.
The state presented testimony, however, disputing the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs evidence as to his degree of emotional disturbance. John Sullivan, a psychiatrist, testified for *122the state that, although the defendant had difficulty controlling his anger at times, there was nothing to indicate that the defendant had been psychotic or out of touch with reality. Several police officers testified that the defendant had not appeared to be agitated or shaking, and responded to questions calmly. Moreover, one police officer testified that the defendant did not appear to be Ã¢ÂÂat the end of his rope.Ã¢ÂÂ
Section 53a-54a (a) provides in relevant part that Ã¢ÂÂit shall be an affirmative defense [to the crime of murder] that the defendant committed the proscribed act or acts under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance for which there was a reasonable explanation or excuse, the reasonableness of which is to be determined from the viewpoint of a person in the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs situation under the circumstances as the defendant believed them to be.Ã¢ÂÂ Extreme emotional disturbance Ã¢ÂÂis a mitigating circumstance which will reduce the crime of murder to manslaughter.Ã¢ÂÂ State v. Asherman, 193 Conn. 695, 731, 478 A.2d 227 (1984), cert. denied, 470 U.S. 1050, 105 S. Ct. 1749, 84 L. Ed. 2d 814 (1985).
The burden is on the defendant to prove the affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance by a preponderance of the evidence. State v. Traficonda, 223 Conn. 273, 280, 612 A.2d 45 (1992); State v. Asherman, supra. Ã¢ÂÂIn the final analysis, the ultimate determination of the presence or absence of extreme emotional disturbance [is] one of fact for the trier, aided by the expert testimony of both sides, but left to its own factual determinations.Ã¢ÂÂ (Internal quotation marks omitted.) State v. Steiger, 218 Conn. 349, 383, 590 A.2d 408 (1991).
The state concedes that there was substantial evidence that the defendant acted under an extreme emotional disturbance. The defendant, on the other hand, *123also concedes that there was some evidence suggesting that he did not act under an extreme emotional disturbance. In light of these concessions, we rely on the fundamental role of the jury as the finder of fact. In a case in which the evidence is conflicting, it is the quintessential jury function to reject or accept certain evidence, and to believe or disbelieve any expert testimony. See, e.g., State v. Forrest, 216 Conn. 139, 148, 578 A.2d 1066 (1990); State v. Zdanis, 182 Conn. 388, 395, 438 A.2d 696 (1980), cert. denied, 450 U.S. 1003, 101 S. Ct. 1715, 68 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1981).
The defendant, relying on our decision in State v. Hammond, 221 Conn. 264, 604 A.2d 793 (1992), argues that these evidentiary standards do not apply because the evidence of his extreme emotional disturbance was Ã¢ÂÂtruly overwhelming.Ã¢ÂÂ In State v. Hammond, supra, 268, we stated that if the judge concludes that the verdict is Ã¢ÂÂso clearly against the weight of the evidence ... as to indicate that the jury did not correctly apply the law to the facts in evidence . . . or were governed by ignorance, prejudice, corruption or partiality, then it is his duty to set aside the verdict. ... In such a case, [a] verdict may be set aside even if the evidence was conflicting and there was direct evidence in favor of the party who prevailed with the jury.Ã¢ÂÂ (Internal quotation marks omitted.) (DNA evidence suggesting that it was physically impossible for defendant to have committed offense).
In the present case, the defendant has not demonstrated that the jury incorrectly applied the law to the facts or was governed by ignorance, prejudice, corruption or partiality. To the contrary, there were substantial facts from which the jury could have concluded that the defendant did not act under an extreme emotional disturbance. The jury heard testimony from the stateÃ¢ÂÂs expert witness that the defendant was not psychotic and that he was not unreasonable in desiring not to *124have anyone else park in his space. Furthermore, there was ample testimony that the defendant, immediately following the attack on the victim, was not in a state of extreme emotional disturbance but instead remained calm, called the police, and understood the import of his actions. From these facts, and the juryÃ¢ÂÂs right to reject any or all of the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs evidence, we conclude that the trial court properly denied the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs motions for a judgment of acquittal and a new trial.
Ill
The defendant claims that the trial court improperly instructed the jury regarding the affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance. We are not persuaded.
The following facts are relevant to this claim. The trial court instructed the jury on extreme emotional disturbance, in relevant part, as follows: Ã¢ÂÂOur statute on the affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance insofar as it applies to this case provides that, Ã¢ÂÂin any prosecution for murder, it shall be an affirmative defense that the defendant committed the proscribed act or acts under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance for which there was a reasonable explanation or excuse, the reasonableness of which is to be determined from the viewpoint of a person in the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs situation under the circumstances as the defendant believed them to be.Ã¢ÂÂ . . .
Ã¢ÂÂI will now discuss with you the elements of the affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance. There are three elements to this affirmative defense.
Ã¢ÂÂFirst; the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs emotional disturbance was not a mental disease or defect that rises to the level of the affirmative defense of mental disease or defect as that has been defined [for] you. That is, that he was *125not suffering from a mental disease or defect that caused him to lack substantial capacity as a result of that mental disease or defect either to appreciate the wrongfulness of his act or to adjust his conduct to the requirements of the law.
Ã¢ÂÂSecondly; that the defendant was exposed to an extremely unusual and overwhelming stress that is more than mere annoyance or unhappiness. While this emotional stress might often be caused by a sudden triggering situation, hot blood as you say, it might as well arise by virtue of a significant mental trauma causedÃ¢ÂÂcausing a long period of brooding or dwelling on some presumed injustice.
Ã¢ÂÂAnd thirdly; the defendant had an extreme emotional reaction to this state as a result of which there was a loss of self control and his reason was overborne by intense feelings, such as passion or anger or distress or grief, or excessive agitation or other similar emotions. You should give consideration as to whether the intensity of these feelings was such that the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs usual intellectual and emotional controls failed, and that his normal rational thinking no longer prevailed at the time of the act.
Ã¢ÂÂAs used in this affirmative defense, the word Ã¢ÂÂextremeÃ¢ÂÂ means the greatest degree of intensity away from the norm, away from the normal or usual state for the defendant.
Ã¢ÂÂIf you find that the defendant acted under extreme emotional disturbance as I have defined that term for you, you must also find . . . that there was a reasonable explanation . . . for any emotional disturbance suffered by the defendant at the time of the stabbing. The reasonableness of this explanation or excuse is to be determined from the viewpoint of a reasonable person in the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs situation under the circumstances as the defendant believed them to be.Ã¢ÂÂ
*126The jury deliberated for more than four days. The jury asked for reinstruction on this affirmative defense on three separate occasions. The reinstructions were, for the most part, the same as the original instruction. After the second reinstruction, the court also stated: Ã¢ÂÂAnd here if the evidence and the claims of the defendant, as I understand it, is that theÃ¢ÂÂthere was a trauma causing a long period of dwelling on presumed injustice with regard to the circumstances involving himself and involving his parkingÃ¢ÂÂallotted parking space.Ã¢ÂÂ
After further deliberation, the jury sought reinstruction again on extreme emotional disturbance, requesting that the trial court focus on: (1) the three factors that make up the defense and whether all three must be met; (2) the definition of the Ã¢ÂÂnormÃ¢ÂÂ and whose norm is relevant, societyÃ¢ÂÂs or the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs; and (3) the reasonable personÃ¢ÂÂs perspective. The trial court repeated its prior instructions and also stated that the reasonableness of the explanation for the emotional disturbance must be Ã¢ÂÂdetermined from the viewpoint of a reasonable person; that is, a person of ordinary intellect and faculties, who finds himÃ¢ÂÂwho would find himself in the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs situation under the circumstances as the defendant believed it to be.Ã¢ÂÂ
A
The defendant first argues that the charge on extreme emotional disturbance was improper because the jury was instructed that the reasonableness of the explanation or excuse for the emotional disturbance was to be determined from the viewpoint of a reasonable person in the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs situation under the circumstances as the defendant believed them to be. The defendant contends that the jury should be instructed that the reasonableness of the explanation or excuse must be determined from his perspective rather than a reasonable personÃ¢ÂÂs perspective. Additionally, the *127defendant argues that this instruction is improper in any case in which the defendant has also raised the affirmative defense of mental disease or defect because the jury is likely to become confused about the relationship between the affirmative defenses. We disagree.
In State v. Ortiz, 217 Conn. 648, 652-53, 588 A.2d 127 (1991), we rejected a virtually identical challenge to such an instruction. In Ortiz, the defendant claimed that ÃÂ§ 53a-54a (a) required an instruction that the jury must consider the reasonableness of the explanation or excuse as determined from the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs viewpoint rather than from the viewpoint of a reasonable person in the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs situation under the circumstances as he believed them to be. Relying on our decision in State v. Elliott, 177 Conn. 1, 411 A.2d 3 (1979), we concluded that the legislature intended to establish Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂa standard that is objective in its overview, but subjective as to the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs beliefÃ¢ÂÂ; id. [7]; and, with regard to the objective element contained in the statute, [we stated] that Ã¢ÂÂthe reasonable man yardstick is only used to determine the reasonableness of the explanation or excuse of the action of the defendant from the viewpoint of a person in the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs situation under the circumstances as the defendant believed them to be.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ State v. Ortiz, supra, 653.
We reasoned in Ortiz that the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs challenge to the instruction, as in the present case, would Ã¢ÂÂeviscerate the element of objectivity that the drafters intended to preserve,Ã¢ÂÂ and would make the inquiry entirely subjective. Id., 657. We recently affirmed Ortiz in State v. Steiger, 218 Conn. 349, 385, 590 A.2d 408 (1991). In the present case, the defendant has not presented any significant justification for overruling Ortiz other than an unsupported claim that the standard is unworkable.4 Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ[A] court should not overrule its earlier *128decisions unless the most cogent reasons and inescapable logic require it.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ5 Connecticut National Bank v. Commissioner of Revenue Services, 209 Conn. 429, 435-36, 551 A.2d 417 (1988).
The defendant also argues that the instruction was improper because it could not be understood in conjunction with the evidence relating to his affirmative defense of mental disease or defect. This argument is unpersuasive. First, the trial court carefully instructed the jury that it was to consider the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance only if it had first rejected the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs affirmative defense of mental disease or defect. Furthermore, the trial court specifically instructed the jury that the extreme emotional disturbance defense Ã¢ÂÂis different from the affirmative defense of mental disease or defect which I explained to you earlier. . . . [TJhat affirmative defense, the defense of disease or [mental] defect is a complete defense to criminal liability and if the defendant establishes it, results in a verdict of not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect.Ã¢ÂÂ Finally, the trial court explained that, in order for the jury to conclude that the defendant had established the defense of extreme emotional disturbance, it must find, in addition to other elements, that Ã¢ÂÂthe defendantÃ¢ÂÂs emotional disturbance was not a mental disease or defect that rises to the level of the affirmative defense of mental disease or defect as that has been defined [for] you.Ã¢ÂÂ
*129After a careful review of this charge, we conclude that the instructions adequately guided the jury as to the relationship between the two defenses and their separate elements.6 This not a case in which only a jury Ã¢ÂÂcomposed of [twelve] lawyersÃ¢ÂÂ could have adequately understood the instructions. See State v. Milardo, 224 Conn. 397, 422, 618 A.2d 1347 (1993) (Berdon, J., dissenting). Although the jury requested reinstruction several times on the affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance, we are not obligated to infer from that fact that the jury was not given adequate guidance or that the charge ultimately could not be comprehended by laypersons. State v. Rivera, 223 Conn. 41, 44-47, 612 A.2d 749 (1992) (instructions on extreme emotional disturbance provided adequate guide to jury despite juryÃ¢ÂÂs request for reinstruction on defense four times). In the present case, the Ã¢ÂÂtrial courtÃ¢ÂÂs instructions and reinstructions were clear and *130comprehensible and sufficient to provide guidance to the jury in applying the law to the facts it [found] established.Ã¢ÂÂ (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 47.
B
The defendant also argues that the trial court improperly instructed the jury on extreme emotional disturbance because it mischaracterized the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs evidence in relation to this affirmative defense. In the last set of reinstructions, the court stated: Ã¢ÂÂI believe the evidence . . . is that the defendant is claiming not that there was a sudden triggering situation that created this unusual or overwhelming stress, but that it was trauma, mental trauma, significant mental trauma causing a long period of brooding or dwelling on some presumed injustice, and the evidence is concerning this parking space.Ã¢ÂÂ Specifically, the defendant argues that this instruction improperly suggested that the jury was free to consider only evidence of a long period of brooding and was not free to consider the evidence suggesting a sudden provocation based on the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs confrontation with the victim over the parking spot. We disagree.
Contrary to the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs argument, we do not read this instruction as containing an order, explicit or implicit, to disregard the evidence relating to a sudden triggering event, such as the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs confrontation with the victim regarding the parking space. First, the trial court did not tell the jury that a sudden *131incident could not have provided an adequate basis for the defense. In fact, the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs earlier instructions and reinstructions specifically mentioned the possibility of a sudden triggering event. Second, the trial court stated that it was only its belief that the evidence supported a Ã¢ÂÂlong period of broodingÃ¢ÂÂ instead of a Ã¢ÂÂsudden triggering situation.Ã¢ÂÂ
Moreover, prior to this reinstruction, the trial court had instructed the jury as to its role as the finder of fact: Ã¢ÂÂIf during the course of this charge I refer to certain evidence or facts, my purpose is to [allude] to them only insofar as it is necessary to make clear to you, the application of the rules of law which are relevant in this case. When I do refer to certain facts or evidence, you are not [to] assume I mean to emphasize those facts or that evidence, nor must you limit your consideration only to them. Should I overlook any evidence in the case, you will supply it from you own recollection. And should I incorrectly state any evidence in relation to your own recollection, you will correct my error and apply your own recollection.Ã¢ÂÂ
The jury is Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂpresumed to follow the courtÃ¢ÂÂs directions in the absence of a clear indication to the contrary.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ State v. Negron, 221 Conn. 315, 331, 603 A.2d 1138 (1992). In the context of the entire instructions and reinstructions, the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs statement could not have misled a reasonable juror into concluding that a sudden triggering event was not relevant to the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs affirmative defense. See State v. Milardo, supra, 409. Finally, we are not convinced that the trial court mischaracterized the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs evidence. Virtually all the evidence introduced by the defendant, including his past psychological history and his long-running concern about his parking space, if believed, tended to demonstrate that the defendant suffered from Ã¢ÂÂa mental trauma causing a long period of brooding or dwelling on some presumed injustice.Ã¢ÂÂ On the other hand, *132the defendant offered minimal evidence on the actual confrontation between him and the victim in the parking lot. Consequently, we conclude that the trial court properly instructed the jury on the affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance and properly characterized the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs evidence.
IV
The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly refused to instruct the jury that the absence of motive or premeditation may tend to raise a reasonable doubt as to his intent. We disagree.
The following facts are relevant to this claim. The trial court instructed the jury at length on motive and premeditation.7 The trial court charged the jury that *133it could consider the issue of motive but that the state did not need to prove motive in order for the jury to find the defendant guilty of the offense. The trial court explained that motive may or may not be helpful in considering evidence related to the issue of intent. The trial court, however, did not instruct the jury that the absence of motive or premeditation may tend to raise a reasonable doubt as to the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs intent. The defendant never filed a request for such a charge, but did, after the instructions were given, object to the instructions on that basis.
Ã¢ÂÂ[I]f the evidence warrants it and if an accurate and timely request to charge is made, the trial court must instruct the jury that a lack of evidence on motive may tend to raise a reasonable doubt.Ã¢ÂÂ8 State v. Pinnock, 220 Conn. 765, 790, 601 A.2d 521 (1992). If, however, the state introduces evidence tending to demonstrate a motive to commit the offense, then the trial court is not obligated to give such an instruction. Id., 790-92. In the present case, the defendant did not request this charge. Moreover, the state and the defendant introduced substantial evidence tending to demonstrate that the defendant attacked the victim because the victim had parked in the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs parking space. In the context of this case, that evidence tended to prove the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs motive for his conduct. Consequently, the trial court properly did not instruct the jury that the absence of motive or premeditation may tend to raise a reasonable doubt as to the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs intent.
V
The defendant claims that the trial court improperly refused to exclude testimony of the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs expert witness on cross-examination regarding the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs consumption of alcohol prior to the crime. We disagree.
*134In support of the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs affirmative defenses of mental disease or defect and extreme emotional disturbance, Merikangas testified that, at the time of the attack, the defendant suffered from paranoid schizophrenia, and that the attack would not have occurred but for the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs mental illness. MerikangasÃ¢ÂÂ testimony was based on a written report, portions of which he read aloud while testifying, that he had prepared in connection with his examination of the defendant. The written report stated, in a portion that Merikangas did not read aloud, that the defendant had consumed a six pack of beer and some wine prior to returning home on the evening of the attack. This portion of the report concluded that Ã¢ÂÂMr. Raguseo is a chronic paranoid schizophrenic . . . who under the stress of the circumstance felt threatened and because of a defect of mind and reason exacerbated by alcohol and diabetes was substantially incapable of conforming his conduct to the requirements of law.Ã¢ÂÂ
On cross-examination, the state questioned Merikangas about his reliance on the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs consumption of alcohol and about the alcoholÃ¢ÂÂs effect on the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs actions. The defendant objected to this line of questioning but the trial court overruled that objection. The trial court cautioned the jury, however, that it was to consider MerikangasÃ¢ÂÂ testimony about the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs alcohol consumption, not as evidence that the defendant had in fact ingested alcohol that evening, but only to evaluate MerikangasÃ¢ÂÂ conclusions about the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs ability to control his behavior.
The defendant first argues that the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs ruling violated Practice Book ÃÂ§ 7609 because the testimony *135concerned statements made by the defendant during the course of a mental examination. The defendantÃ¢ÂÂs argument, however, ignores ÃÂ§ 760Ã¢ÂÂs preclusion of the evidence only on the issue of guilt. In this case, as the trial court specifically instructed the jury, the statement regarding the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs alcohol consumption was to be considered by the jury solely to evaluate the expert witnessÃ¢ÂÂ opinion on the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs mental condition. See State v. Steiger, 218 Conn. 349, 362 n.13, 590 A.2d 408 (1991).
The defendant next argues that the statement should have been excluded because it was an answer to a hypothetical question that was based on facts not in evidence.10 Ã¢ÂÂ[T]he determination of the admissibility of a hypothetical question calls for the exercise of a sound discretion as to whether the question, even [if] it does not contain all of the facts in evidence, presents the facts in such a manner that they bear a true and fair relationship to each other and to the whole evidence in the case . . . is not so worded as to be likely to mislead or confuse the jury, and is not so lacking in the essential facts as to be without value in the decision of the case.Ã¢ÂÂ (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Shelnitz v. Greenberg, 200 Conn. 58, 77, 509 A.2d 1023 (1986). The jury Ã¢ÂÂwas entitled to consider the basis of *136the testimony of the expert witness. . . . It might consider also the reasonableness of his judgments about the underlying facts and of the conclusions which he drew from them.Ã¢ÂÂ State v. Perez, 182 Conn. 603, 610, 438 A.2d 1149 (1981). Because the stateÃ¢ÂÂs questions sought to elicit the bases of MerikangasÃ¢ÂÂ testimony, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the testimony.11
VI
The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly allowed the stateÃ¢ÂÂs expert witness to testify to an opinion on the ultimate issue of the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs guilt. We are not persuaded.
John Sullivan, a psychiatrist, testified for the state to rebut the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs assertion of the affirmative defense of mental disease or defect. A defendant can prevail on that defense if he can demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that, as a result of a mental disease or defect, the defendant Ã¢ÂÂlacked substantial capacity . . . either to appreciate the wrongfulness' of his conduct or to control his conduct within the requirements of the law.Ã¢ÂÂ (Emphasis added.) General Statutes ÃÂ§ 53a-13 (a). On direct examination, the state asked Sullivan: Ã¢ÂÂ[D]o you have an opinion stated in terms of reasonable medical certainty whether at the time of the stabbing on June 21,1990, the defendant had the ability to choose between alternative courses of action?Ã¢ÂÂ Over the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs objection, Sullivan testified that, in his opinion, the defendant had the ability to choose between alternative courses of action.
The defendant claims that by allowing this testimony the trial court violated General Statutes ÃÂ§ 54-86ÃÂ.12 Sec*137tion 54-86ÃÂ prohibits an expert witness from testifying as to whether a criminal defendant did or did not have the mental state that constitutes an element of the crime charged or a defense to that crime. Section 54-86ÃÂ permits, however, an expert witness to state his diagnosis of the mental state or condition of the defendant.
We have construed ÃÂ§ 54-86ÃÂ narrowly in accordance with our assumption that the legislature, in enacting the statute, intended a reasonable and rational result. State v. Forrest, 216 Conn. 139, 149, 578 A.2d 1066 (1990). Ã¢ÂÂA broad construction of the statute . . . would arguably bar experts from fully testifying to their diagnoses of a defendant and to their resulting professional opinions, from which the jury could infer the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs state of mind at the time of a particular act. Jurors would thus be left without adequate expert assistance in making an informed decision upon the ultimate issue of the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs mental state, the precise issue expressly reserved to them by ÃÂ§ 54-86ÃÂ. Additionally, a defendantÃ¢ÂÂs ability to prove affirmative defenses involving mental state would be severely curtailed. Consequently, we do not believe that the legislature intended to proscribe expert opinion testimony with respect to a defendantÃ¢ÂÂs mental state so strictly as to render it an ineffective aid to the jury, or to eclipse the role of expert opinion testimony in substantiating a defendantÃ¢ÂÂs claim to have suffered from a certain mental condition at the time of an act alleged to be criminal in nature.Ã¢ÂÂ Id.
*138Admittedly, SullivanÃ¢ÂÂs testimony closely approximated the statutory language establishing the affirmative defense of mental disease or defect. In light of our narrow reading of ÃÂ§ 54-86ÃÂ, however, we conclude that the testimony was proper. The expert witness was not asked to testify as to whether the defendant Ã¢ÂÂlacked substantial capacity . . . to control his conduct within the requirements of the law.Ã¢ÂÂ General Statutes ÃÂ§ 53a-13 (a). In the absence of testimony explicitly tracking the language of ÃÂ§ 53a-13, the expert witness was not testifying to the ultimate issue of criminal responsibility. To hold otherwise, as noted above, would handicap criminal defendants from offering expert testimony that would directly support their assertion of an affirmative defense.13
Furthermore, the jury was explicitly instructed that it was Ã¢ÂÂentitled to accept or reject in whole or in part, the evidence of the experts as to whether the defendant had a mental disease or defect.Ã¢ÂÂ The jury was also instructed that Ã¢ÂÂno matter what may be the expertise of a particular witness who states an opinion to you upon a fact in the case, that opinion is still subject to review at your hands. His opinion is [in] no way binding upon you.Ã¢ÂÂ In light of our narrow construction of ÃÂ§ 54-86ÃÂ and the lack of any evidence that the jury did not follow these instructions, we conclude that the trial court did not violate ÃÂ§ 54-86ÃÂ in overruling the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs objection.
VII
The defendantÃ¢ÂÂs final claim is that the trial court improperly denied the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs motion for a new *139trial that was based on evidence obtained following the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs commitment to the Whiting Forensic Institute (Whiting). We disagree.
Following the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs conviction, the defendant was committed to the Whiting. During that commitment the defendant underwent extensive psychological examination. Thereafter, the defendant petitioned the court for a new trial claiming that, in the course of these examinations, new evidence regarding a frontal lobe disorder was discovered that he claimed supported his affirmative defense of mental disease or defect.
Ã¢ÂÂThe standard that governs the granting of a petition for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence is well established. The petitioner must demonstrate, by a preponderance of the evidence, that: (1) the proffered evidence is newly discovered, such that it could not have been discovered earlier by the exercise of due diligence; (2) it would be material on a new trial; (3) it is not merely cumulative; and (4) it is likely to produce a different result in a new trial.Ã¢ÂÂ State v. Asherman, 202 Conn. 429, 434, 521 A.2d 578 (1987). Ã¢ÂÂIt is within the discretion of the trial court to determine, upon examination of all the evidence, whether the petitioner has established substantial grounds for a new trial, and the judgment of the trial court will be set aside on appeal only if it reflects a clear abuse of discretion.Ã¢ÂÂ Id.; Kubeck v. Foremost Foods Co., 190 Conn. 667, 670, 461 A.2d 1380 (1983).
The trial court held an evidentiary hearing on the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs petition but concluded that the evidence of the frontal lobe disorder was not newly discovered evidence and was cumulative of evidence presented at trial. The record clearly supports this conclusion. The defendantÃ¢ÂÂs expert witness, Merikangas, had testified at trial that tests Ã¢ÂÂindicated [an abnormality] in the *140frontal lobes and the varietal occipital lobes .... In other words, there are areas of abnormality within the brain that are demonstrated by the MRI scan.Ã¢ÂÂ Moreover, the defendant had offered extensive testimony concerning his psychological history and his mental condition prior to the attack. In light of this testimony, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by concluding that the defendant had failed to demonstrate the existence of newly discovered evidence and that evidence gathered from the Whiting examination was not cumulative of the evidence introduced at trial.
The judgment is affirmed.
In this opinion Peters, C. J., Norcott and Santaniello, Js., concurred.

 The defendant appeals pursuant to General Statutes ÃÂ§ 51-199 (b) (3), which provides in relevant part: Ã¢ÂÂThe following matters shall be taken directly to the supreme court ... an appeal in any criminal action involving a conviction for a capital felony, class A felony, or other felony, including any persistent offender status, for which the maximum sentence which may be imposed exceeds twenty years.Ã¢ÂÂ


 General Statutes ÃÂ§ 53a-54a provides in relevant part: Ã¢ÂÂmurder, (a) A person is guilty of murder when, with intent to cause the death of another person, he causes the death of such person or of a third person or causes a suicide by force, duress or deception; except that in any prosecution under this subsection, it shall be an affirmative defense that the defendant committed the proscribed act or acts under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance for which there was a reasonable explanation or excuse, the reasonableness of which is to be determined from the viewpoint of a person in the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs situation under the circumstances as the defendant believed them to be, provided nothing contained in this subsection shall constitute a defense to a prosecution for, or preclude a conviction of, manslaughter in the first degree or any other crime.
Ã¢ÂÂ(b) Evidence that the defendant suffered from a mental disease, mental defect or other mental abnormality is admissible, in a prosecution under subsection (a) of this section, on the question of whether the defendant acted with intent to cause the death of another person.Ã¢ÂÂ


 On appeal, the defendant has raised seven claims. The large number of claims, however, Ã¢ÂÂserves neither the ends of justice nor the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs own purposes as possibly meritorious issues are obscured by the sheer number of claims that are put before us.
Ã¢ÂÂLegal contentions, like the currency, depreciate through over-issue. The mind of an appellate judge is habitually receptive to the suggestion that a lower court committed an error. But receptiveness declines as the number of assigned errors increases. Multiplicity hints at lack of confidence in any one [issue] .... Jackson, Ã¢ÂÂAdvocacy Before the United States Supreme Court,Ã¢ÂÂ 25 Temple L.Q. 115, 119 (1951); Jones v. Barnes, 463 U.S. 745, 752, 103 S. Ct. 3308, 77 L. Ed. 2d 987 (1983).
Ã¢ÂÂMost cases present only one, two, or three significant questions. . . . Usually ... if you cannot win on a few major points, the others are not likely to help. . . . R. Stern,Ã¢ÂÂAppellate Practice in the United StatesÃ¢ÂÂ266 (1981). Jones v. Barnes, supra.Ã¢ÂÂ (Internal quotation marks omitted.) State v. Pelletier, 209 Conn. 564, 566-67, 552 A.2d 805 (1989).


 The defendant concedes that no state has adopted a totally subjective extreme emotional disturbance defense, as would be required if we were to agree with his claim.


 The defendant requests that, in the absence of a decision to overturn State v. Ortiz, 217 Conn. 648, 588 A.2d 127 (1991), we limit our decision in Ortiz by requiring a purely subjective instruction on extreme emotional disturbance in a case, as in the present one, in which the defendant also raises the affirmative defense of mental disease or defect. As noted above, however, the affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance is properly considered by the jury only if it has already rejected the affirmative defense of mental disease or defect. In light of that procedure, the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs request to limit Ortiz is simply a replication of his earlier argument that Ortiz was wrongly decided.


 Additionally, the trial court provided a verdict form to the jury that, similar to the oral jury instructions, individually listed the possible verdicts that the jury could return and the order in which the issues and defenses should be considered. The form read in relevant part:
Ã¢ÂÂPOSSIBLE VERDICTS
Ã¢ÂÂ1. If you find that the State has proven the elements of the crime of murder as charged in the information beyond a reasonable doubt, you must then consider the affirmative defense of mental disease or defect;
Ã¢ÂÂ2. If you find that the State has proven the elements of the crime of murder as charged in the information beyond a reasonable doubt, but find that the defendant has proven the affirmative defense of mental disease or defect, you need consider no further and your verdict would be: NOT GUILTY BY REASON OF MENTAL DISEASE OR DEFECT;
Ã¢ÂÂ3. If you find that the State has proven the elements of the crime of murder as charged in the information beyond a reasonable doubt, but also find that the defendant has not proven the affirmative defense of mental disease or defect, you must then consider the affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance;
Ã¢ÂÂ4. If you find that the State has proven the elements of the crime of murder as charged in the information beyond a reasonable doubt, and also find that the defendant has not proven the affirmative defense of mental disease or defect, but do find that the defendant has proven the affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance, you need consider no fur*130ther and your verdict would be: NOT GUILTY OF MURDER BUT GUILTY OF MANSLAUGHTER IN THE FIRST DEGREE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF EXTREME EMOTIONAL DISTURBANCE;
Ã¢ÂÂ5. If you find that the State has proven the elements of the crime of murder as charged in the information beyond a reasonable doubt, and also find that the defendant has not proven the affirmative defense of mental disease or defect and also find that the defendant has not proven the affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance, you need consider no further and your verdict would be: GUILTY OF MURDER AS CHARGED.Ã¢ÂÂ


 The trial court gave the following instruction on motive and premeditation: Ã¢ÂÂOn this issue, you may wish to examine for example, what motive if any there was for the acts; where the act took place; the length of time it took to commit the act; the number of stab wounds inflicted and the manner in which they were inflicted, or any other factors which you consider relevant.
Ã¢ÂÂNow, IÃ¢ÂÂve mentioned motive, but I must caution you about that question. Because the killing of one human being by another is so abhorrent to us, we . . . begin to wonder why it was done .... In other words, what was the motive? This is so common a reaction that we often hear motive discussed in connection with a killing as if it were a necessary factor in the law of Murder [or] of any other homicide. But it is not.
Ã¢ÂÂWhile you have heard some testimony from several witnesses as to the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs words or conduct which might be considered his reason for causing death, I must instruct you that the whole question of motive is only of secondary importance. It may or [may] not have a bearing on the facts. It may, whether you are or whether you are not convinced that a motive existed, help your general understanding of the factual situation. But motive is not a necessary element of Murder .... The crime may or may not be proved without consideration of motive whatsoever. Motive is not the same as intent. Proof of intent is absolutely necessary for the crime of murder. Motive ... is the reason or believed reason for causing death. . . .
Ã¢ÂÂNow, premeditation, planning or giving thought to the act for any space of time, is not a prerequisite in determining intent. Intent may be formed in seconds, actually in a brief instant before the commission of an act. However, it is necessary for the intent to be formed prior to or during the act or acts resulting in the commission of a crime.Ã¢ÂÂ


 We have never held, however, that the same rule applies to evidence of premeditation.


 Practice Book ÃÂ§ 760 provides: Ã¢ÂÂpsychiatric examination
Ã¢ÂÂIn an appropriate case the judicial authority may, upon motion of the prosecuting authority, order the defendant to submit to a psychiatric examination by a psychiatrist designated for this purpose in the order of the court. No statement made by the defendant in the course of any examination provided for by Sec. 757, whether the examination shall be with or without *135the consent of the defendant, shall be admitted in evidence against the defendant on the issue of guilt in any criminal proceeding. A copy of the report of the psychiatric examination shall be furnished to the defendant within a reasonable time after the examination.Ã¢ÂÂ


 The relevant exchange during cross-examination is as follows:
Ã¢ÂÂ[The State]: You concluded, did you not Doctor, that the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs behaviorÃ¢ÂÂexcuse meÃ¢ÂÂhis defective mind and reason the morning in question, was exacerbated by alcohol; did you not?
Ã¢ÂÂ[Merikangas]: I did.
Ã¢ÂÂ[The State]: Do you have an opinion whether the defendant would have acted differently that night if he had not voluntarily ingested alcohol? . . .
Ã¢ÂÂ[Merikangas]: The answer is yes.
Ã¢ÂÂ[The State]: He would have acted differently?
Ã¢ÂÂ[Merikangas]: The answer that you have is that he may have, he may not have.Ã¢ÂÂ


 The defendant also argues that the evidence relating to his consumption of alcohol was unduly prejudicial and therefore should have been excluded. Because it was within the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs discretion to allow the questions, which were based on MerikangasÃ¢ÂÂ testimony, and because there was nothing inherently prejudicial about the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs alcohol consumption, we conclude that this argument is without merit.


 General Statutes ÃÂ§ 54-86ÃÂ provides: Ã¢ÂÂtestimony of expert witness RE MENTAL STATE OR CONDITION of defendant. No expert witness tes*137tifying with respect to the mental state or condition of a defendant in a criminal case may state an opinion or inference as to whether the defendant did or did not have the mental state or condition constituting an element of the crime charged or of a defense thereto, except that such expert witness may state his diagnosis of the mental state or condition of the defendant. The ultimate issue as to whether the defendant was criminally responsible for the crime charged is a matter for the trier of fact alone.Ã¢ÂÂ


 In fact, the defendant introduced MerikangasÃ¢ÂÂ written report, which stated that Ã¢ÂÂMr. Raguseo is a chronic paranoid schizophrenic . . . who under the stress of the circumstance felt threatened and because of a defect of mind and reason exacerbated by alcohol and diabetes was substantially incapable of conforming his conduct to the requirements of law. Ã¢ÂÂ (Emphasis added.) This written statement is, of course, almost identical to the language of General Statutes ÃÂ§ 53a-13.

"

Berdon, J.,
dissenting. I disagree with the majority, which upholds the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs jury instruction on the defense of extreme emotional disturbance pursuant to General Statutes ÃÂ§ 53a-54a (a).1 The trial court stated that the reasonableness of the explanation or excuse for the emotional disturbance was to be determined from the viewpoint of a reasonable person in the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs situation under circumstances as the defendant believed them to be. Although the majority finds support for its conclusion in State v. Ortiz, 217 Conn. 648, 588 A.2d 127 (1991), I believe that Ortiz was wrongfully decided on this issue. The trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs injection of the term Ã¢ÂÂreasonableÃ¢ÂÂ into the language of the extreme emotional disturbance defense created an overly objective test that prevented the jury from considering the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs mental abnormalities.
For this defense to make any sense, the juryÃ¢ÂÂs determination of whether there was a reasonable explanation or excuse for the extreme emotional disturbance (the objective test) must be determined from the *141defendantÃ¢ÂÂs viewpoint under circumstances as the defendant believed them to be (the subjective test), not the viewpoint of a reasonable person in the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs situation. The jury must be able to consider the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs eccentricities in order to assess the situation from the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs viewpoint. I have concluded that this subjective/objective test must be employed for several reasons.
The plain language of the statute directs us to determine the reasonableness of the explanation or excuse for the emotional disturbance Ã¢ÂÂfrom the viewpoint of a person in the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs situation under the circumstances as the defendant believed them to be.Ã¢ÂÂ General Statutes ÃÂ§ 53a-54a (a). This clearly means the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs situation under the circumstances as the defendant perceived them to be.
Further support for taking the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs unique mental and emotional perspective into account when applying the extreme emotional disturbance defense can be found in State v. Elliott, 177 Conn. 1, 8-10, 411 A.2d 3 (1979), which holds that the Ã¢ÂÂjury should be instructed that the reasonableness of a defendantÃ¢ÂÂs act under an extreme emotional disturbance is to be determined from the viewpoint of a person in the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs situation under the circumstances as the defendant believed them to be.Ã¢ÂÂ (Emphasis added.) Id., 10. In Elliott, this court required analysis that focused on Ã¢ÂÂthe norm for that individualÃ¢ÂÂ defendant, rather than a reasonable person, in applying the extreme emotional disturbance defense. Id. The phrase Ã¢ÂÂin the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs situationÃ¢ÂÂ requires the jury to consider not only the factual situation in which the defendant found himself (the parking space conflict), but the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs unique mental and emotional characteristics and the impact of these factors on his perception of the circumstances.
*142Our extreme emotional disturbance defense, as provided in ÃÂ§ 53a-54a (a), is based on the Model Penal Code of the American Law Institute, Tentative Draft No. 9, ÃÂ§ 201.3.2 State v. Elliott, supra, 8. If there is any ambiguity in the language of ÃÂ§ 53a-54a (a), the comments accompanying the Model Penal Code clarify that the jury must consider the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs situation in applying the defense. The importantÃ¢ÂÂand necessary-terms are Ã¢ÂÂsituationÃ¢ÂÂ and Ã¢ÂÂcircumstances.Ã¢ÂÂ As the Model Penal Code comments explain, Ã¢ÂÂ[t]he word Ã¢ÂÂsituationÃ¢ÂÂ is designedly ambiguous. On the one hand, it is clear that personal handicaps and some external circumstances must be taken into account. Thus, blindness, shock from traumatic injury, and extreme grief are all easily read into the term Ã¢ÂÂsituation.Ã¢ÂÂ This result is sound, for it would be morally obtuse to appraise a crime for mitigation of punishment without reference to these factors. On the other hand, it is equally plain that idiosyncratic moral values are not part of the actorÃ¢ÂÂs situation.Ã¢ÂÂ (Emphasis added.) II A.L.I., Model Penal Code and Commentaries (1980) ÃÂ§ 210.3 (1) (b), comment, p. 62. Thus, the drafters intended the word Ã¢ÂÂsituationÃ¢ÂÂ to focus the juryÃ¢ÂÂs attention on the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs unique mental and emotional attributes, while still allowing the jury to determine whether a reasonable person would agree that the explanation or excuse for the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs emotional disturbance was objectively reasonable.
Additional support for this subjective/objective test can be found in People v. Liebman, 179 App. Div. 2d 245, 583 N.Y.S.2d 234 (1992), and People v. Casassa, 49 N.Y.2d 668, 404 N.E.2d 1310, 427 N.Y.S.2d 769, cert. denied, 449 U.S. 842, 101 S. Ct. 122, 66 L. Ed. 2d 50 (1980). These cases are helpful because ÃÂ§ 53a-54a (a) is virtually identical to New York Penal *143Law ÃÂ§ 125.25 (1) (a), which sets forth the New York extreme emotional disturbance defense. State v. Ortiz, supra, 654 n.6.
Although Ortiz purportedly relied on People v. Casassa, supra, to support the conclusion that the reasonableness of the explanation or excuse for the emotional disturbance was to be determined from the viewpoint of a reasonable person in the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs situation, Casassa clearly endorses a test that is both subjective and objective and incorporates the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs subjective, internal idiosyncracies.
In Casassa, the New York Court of Appeals held that Ã¢ÂÂ[i]n light of . . . the necessity of articulating the defense in terms comprehensible to jurors, we conclude that the determination whether there was reasonable explanation or excuse for a particular emotional disturbance should be made by viewing the subjective, internal situation in which the defendant found himself and the external circumstances as he perceived them at that time, however inaccurate that perception may have been, and assessing from that standpoint whether the explanation or excuse for his emotional disturbance was reasonable, so as to entitle him to a reduction of the crime charged from murder in the second degree to manslaughter in the first degree.Ã¢ÂÂ (Emphasis added.) Id., 679.
Following Casassa, the Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court in People v. Liebman, supra, 241, noted that the Ã¢ÂÂ[application of the statute governing the availability of the defense of extreme emotional disturbance entails in each case an understanding of the situation as it would have been perceived, not by a perfectly sensible individual but by the particular defendant at bar.Ã¢ÂÂ (Emphasis added.) The court further stated that Ã¢ÂÂ[i]t should be stressed that the issue in this case is not whether the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs *144act of killing his wife was a reasonable response under the circumstances for, clearly, it was not. Rather, the issue is the reasonableness of the explanation offered for the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs extreme emotional reaction.Ã¢ÂÂ Id.
In sum, the test for determining whether the extreme emotional disturbance defense should apply is both subjective, in that it permits the jury to consider the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs particular eccentricities, and objective, in that the jury is asked to determine whether the explanation or excuse for the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs disturbance was reasonable in light of his subjective situation and perception of the circumstances.
I can understand why the jury had difficulty applying the courtÃ¢ÂÂs instructionsÃ¢ÂÂhaving been instructed on the extreme emotional disturbance defense four timesÃ¢ÂÂto the substantial evidence indicating extreme emotional disturbance. On the third reinstruction, the jury asked the trial court to focus on whether the definition of Ã¢ÂÂnormÃ¢ÂÂ referred to the norm for the defendant or the norm for society. 3 The jury was obviously struggling to consider the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs emotional or mental imbalance in its determination of the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs situation. The courtÃ¢ÂÂs use of the reasonable person standard, however, effectively precluded any consideration of the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs emotional or mental imbalance.
The facts of this case cried out for the application of the proper extreme emotional disturbance defense. In fact, the majority notes that there was Ã¢ÂÂsubstantialÃ¢ÂÂ evidence to support the defense. Surely, it was *145not reasonable for the defendant to have such a fetish about his parking space. Nevertheless, the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs unreasonable fetish for his parking space, his paranoid perceptions of abuse at work connected with his belief in entitlement to parking, his history of reacting poorly to unexpected events, his increasing depression as well as his history of emotional problems, his diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia and past attempts at suicideÃ¢ÂÂ none of which was reasonable from the perspective of a reasonable person, but all of which comprised the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs situationÃ¢ÂÂshould have been considered by the jury. Since the jury was unable to consider these factors, there was no reasonable explanation or excuse for the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs emotional disturbance precipitating the attack, and the defense became a meaningless distraction to the jury.
The mental state of the defendant presented serious issues that were underscored by a report on the defendant prepared subsequent to trial by the Whiting Forensic Institute, a state institution. The report was introduced into evidence in support of a new trial, the denial of which by the trial court I believe to have been an abuse of discretion. The report indicated that the defendant suffered from a mental disease or defect, and that he suffered from paranoid delusions and delusions of persecution. The report further indicated that the frontal lobe of the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs brain was damaged, which contributed to his psychosis. The majority passes over this report by stating that the doctor called by the defense testified to these abnormalities at trial. The majority fails to mention, however, that the doctorÃ¢ÂÂs credibility was shattered by the state during cross-examination on the matter of the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs consumption of alcohol. The Whiting report, in contrast, was prepared by agents of the state and would have been objectively placed before the jury for their evaluation without the heavy baggage of partisan advocacy.
*146Because the conduct of a person who has taken the life of another can rarely, if ever, be characterized as reasonable from the viewpoint of a reasonable person, the majority takes the heart out of the extreme emotional disturbance defense by upholding the Ã¢ÂÂreasonable personÃ¢ÂÂ instruction. By adopting the extreme emotional disturbance defense, the legislature sought to bridge the gap between insanity and cold-blooded intent to kill. The majorityÃ¢ÂÂs interpretation eliminates this bridge and forces the jury to choose one extreme or the other.4
Accordingly, I would order a new trial.

 See footnote 2 of the majority opinion.


 Now codified as Model Penal Code ÃÂ§ 210.3 (1985).


 The jury note requesting additional instructions from the court read as follows: Ã¢ÂÂ[Ojnce again, we need the definition of extreme emotional disturbance focusing on (Ã¢ÂÂreally stressing onÃ¢ÂÂ) the following: (1) The three factors that make up the charge and whether or not all three must be met. (2) Definition of Ã¢ÂÂnorm.Ã¢ÂÂ Whose Ã¢ÂÂnormÃ¢ÂÂ are we comparing the action/thought process toÃ¢ÂÂ, the Ã¢ÂÂnormÃ¢ÂÂ for the defendant or the Ã¢ÂÂnormÃ¢ÂÂ for society? (3) Emphasize a Ã¢ÂÂreasonableÃ¢ÂÂ personÃ¢ÂÂs perspective. . . .Ã¢ÂÂ


 I also take issue with footnote 3 of the majority opinion, which criticizes the defendant for raising seven issues. None of the seven issues was frivolous. Moreover, the defendant should not be put in a position of picking and choosing just to satisfy an arbitrary limit. If there are seven issues that have merit and may affect the outcome of the appeal, they should be raised.

Peters, C. J.
The principal issues in these appeals1 are (1) whether the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs judgment is a Ã¢ÂÂfinal judgmentÃ¢ÂÂ that triggers the filing requirement for a complaint for setoff pursuant to General Statutes ÃÂ§ 52-141,2 and (2) whether the trial court abused its equitable discretion by denying setoff in one action while granting setoff in the other action. We affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court in Docket No. 14460 and direct the trial court to issue an articulation in Docket No. 14459.
*150These appeals arise from two separate actions. Paine Webber Jackson & Curtis, Inc. v. Winters (Docket No. 14460) (the PaineWebber action) is a breach of contract action brought by PaineWebber, Inc.3 (PaineWebber), against Geoffrey Winters, a former PaineWebber employee, for WintersÃ¢ÂÂ refusal to repay a loan made to him by PaineWebber during his employment. Winters thereafter asserted twelve counterclaims against PaineWebber. PaineWebber filed a timely offer of judgment, offering to settle its breach of contract claim for $295,000. Winters neither responded to this offer nor filed an offer of judgment on his counterclaims. After a jury trial,4 on May 15, 1989, the trial court rendered two separate judgments: for PaineWebber on the breach of contract claim in the amount of $440,000; and for Winters on five of the counterclaims,5 in the amount of $440,000.18.6 PaineWebber then unsuccessfully moved to set aside the judgment in favor of Winters and for interest on the judgment in favor of PaineWebber pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) ÃÂ§ 52-192a.7
*151PaineWebber appealed to the Appellate Court, claiming, inter alia, that the trial court had improperly denied its motion for interest. Paine Webber Jackson & Curtis, Inc. v. Winters, 22 Conn. App. 640, 579 A.2d 545 (1990). Without disturbing the jury verdicts, the Appellate Court reversed the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs denial of PaineWebberÃ¢ÂÂs motion for interest and directed the trial court to award interest, the amount of which was approximately $245,000.8 Id., 656. Winters unsuccessfully sought certification to appeal to this court from *152the Appellate CourtÃ¢ÂÂs decision. Paine Webber Jackson & Curtis, Inc. v. Winters, 216 Conn. 820, 581 A.2d 1055 (1990).
Within twenty-four hours of issuance of the Appellate CourtÃ¢ÂÂs judgment awarding PaineWebber interest on the judgment in its favor, PaineWebber filed in the trial court both a complaint for setoff of the judgments pursuant to ÃÂ§ 52-141 and a motion for equitable setoff. The trial court denied the setoff, determining that (1) PaineWebber had filed its complaint for setoff more than twenty-four hours after final judgment, in violation of the requirements of ÃÂ§ 52-141,9 and (2) PaineWebber was not entitled on equitable grounds to a setoff of the judgments. PaineWebber appealed to the Appellate Court, which affirmed. Paine Webber Jackson & Curtis, Inc. v. Winters, 26 Conn. App. 322, 600 A.2d 1048 (1991). We subsequently granted PaineWebberÃ¢ÂÂs petition for certification.10
*153Connecticut Bank & Trust Co. v. Winters (Docket No. 14459) (the foreclosure action) is an action seeking to foreclose WintersÃ¢ÂÂ interest in property in Greenwich. 11 PaineWebber was one of the defendants in the foreclosure action because, during the PaineWebber litigation, PaineWebber had secured a prejudgment attachment on this property,12 becoming the third most senior encumbrancer. After a foreclosure sale that yielded $1.1 million, the trial court ordered distribution of the proceeds to the two most senior encumbrancers.13
The trial court, in the foreclosure action, thereafter granted an equitable setoff of the PaineWebber judgments, the effect of which was to reduce the amount owed by Winters to PaineWebber from approximately $685,000, the amount of its judgment plus interest, to approximately $245,000, the amount of interest. The trial court then denied PaineWebberÃ¢ÂÂs motion to stay proceedings pending its appeal from the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs *154denial of setoff in the PaineWebber action. After reserving for PaineWebber a portion of the remaining foreclosure sale proceeds in order to protect PaineWebberÃ¢ÂÂs right to interest,14 pending this courtÃ¢ÂÂs decision on WintersÃ¢ÂÂ petition for certification from the Appellate CourtÃ¢ÂÂs award of interest in the PaineWebber action, the trial court ordered distribution to the fourth and fifth most senior encumbrancers, Weatherly Securities, a mortgagee, and Union Trust Company, respectively.
PaineWebber appealed to the Appellate Court from the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs distribution order and denial of its motion for a stay, and the Appellate Court affirmed. Connecticut Bank & Trust Co. v. Winters, 26 Conn. App. 317, 600 A.2d 1046 (1991). We subsequently granted PaineWebberÃ¢ÂÂs petition for certification.15
In these appeals, PaineWebber raises several claims seeking to achieve consistent decisions regarding setoff in the two actions. PaineWebber argues that, if the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs decisions regarding setoff are affirmed, PaineWebber will be obligated to pay $440,000.18, the *155full judgment rendered against it in the PaineWebber action, even though its security in the foreclosure proceeds has been reduced to $260,000, which the trial court reserved to protect PaineWebberÃ¢ÂÂs right to interest on the PaineWebber judgment rendered in its favor.16 Specifically, in the PaineWebber case, PaineWebber claims that the Appellate Court improperly affirmed the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs determinations that: (1) PaineWebber was not entitled to a setoff of the judgments on equitable grounds;17 and (2) PaineWebber had untimely filed its complaint for setoff. In the foreclosure action, PaineWebber claims that the Appellate CourtÃ¢ÂÂs affirmance of the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs equitable setoff yields an unjust result and has caused extreme prejudice to PaineWebber.18
*156I
The PaineWebber Action
A
PaineWebber claims that its complaint for setoff was timely filed within twenty-four hours of the Appellate CourtÃ¢ÂÂs August, 1990 judgment, in compliance with the requirement of ÃÂ§ 52-141 that a complaint for setoff be filed within twenty-four hours of Ã¢ÂÂfinal judgment.Ã¢ÂÂ PaineWebber contends, therefore, that the trial court improperly concluded that the complaint was untimely. Winters claims, on the other hand, that, to comply with ÃÂ§ 52-141, PaineWebber was required to file its complaint within twenty-four hours of the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs May, 1989 judgment, and that, accordingly, PaineWebberÃ¢ÂÂs complaint, filed in August, 1990, was untimely. We agree with Winters that ÃÂ§ 52-141 required PaineWebber to file its complaint for setoff within twenty-four hours of the trial court judgment, notwithstanding the subsequent appeal.
Pursuant to ÃÂ§ 52-141, a defendant against whom a tort judgment has been rendered may request a court to set off that judgment against a debt owed to the defendant by the plaintiff.19 Section 52-141 (b) (4) requires, however, that the complaint for setoff be filed within twenty-four hours of Ã¢ÂÂfinal judgmentÃ¢ÂÂ on the tort claim. The issue, therefore, is whether PaineWebber complied with the twenty-four hour filing require*157ment, and this inquiry turns on whether the trial court judgment was the Ã¢ÂÂfinal judgmentÃ¢ÂÂ for the purposes of ÃÂ§ 52-141 (b) (4). This question is an issue of first impression in this state.20
In our determination of the meaning of Ã¢ÂÂfinal judgmentÃ¢ÂÂ in the context of ÃÂ§ 52-141 (b) (4), we consider, at the outset, whether that term is ambiguous. Ordinarily, if statutory language is clear and unambiguous, there is no need for statutory construction. Mercado v. Commissioner of Income Maintenance, 222 Conn. 69, 74, 607 A.2d 1142 (1992); Manning v. Barenz, 221 *158Conn. 256, 260, 603 A.2d 399 (1992). If statutory language is ambiguous, however, the court must construe it in accordance with the statuteÃ¢ÂÂs background and purpose, as well as with common sense. In re Valerie D., 223 Conn. 492, 512-13, 613 A.2d 748 (1992); Warkentin v. Burns, 223 Conn. 14, 20, 610 A.2d 1287 (1992); Jutkowitz v. Department of Health Services, 220 Conn. 86, 102, 596 A.2d 374 (1991).
We are persuaded that the Ã¢ÂÂfinal judgmentÃ¢ÂÂ language of ÃÂ§ 52-141 (b) (4) is ambiguous. Our case law has repeatedly recognized that the term Ã¢ÂÂfinal judgmentÃ¢ÂÂ may have different meanings in different contexts. Ã¢ÂÂ[T]he effect of a pending appeal upon an otherwise final judgment has aptly been characterized as Ã¢ÂÂ[o]ne of the most troublesome problems in applying the rule of finality [of judgments],Ã¢ÂÂ because this is an area in which Ã¢ÂÂ[t]here are no technically precise and universally recognized rules . . . .Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ Preisner v. Aetna Casualty & Surety Co., 203 Conn. 407, 413-14, 525 A.2d 83 (1987), quoting F. James & G. Hazard, Civil Procedure (3d Ed. 1985) ÃÂ§ 11.4, p. 592. Ã¢ÂÂ[W]e have recognized that the relationship between a pending appeal and a judgment depends upon the nature of the issue that is to be addressed. Accordingly, a trial court judgment has been held to be final, despite a pending appeal, insofar as the issue was the triggering of the statute of limitations . . . the continuing validity of interlocutory alimony orders ... or the applicability of the rules of res judicata.Ã¢ÂÂ (Citations omitted.) Id., 414; see Capalbo v. Planning & Zoning Board of Appeals, 208 Conn. 480, 486, 547 A.2d 528 (1988). Finally, we note that ÃÂ§ 52-141 itself does not define Ã¢ÂÂfinal judgmentÃ¢ÂÂ or otherwise give guidance as to its meaning.
We must, therefore, construe the term Ã¢ÂÂfinal judgmentÃ¢ÂÂ as it is used in ÃÂ§ 52-141 (b) (4). In determining its meaning, we are guided by the rule announced in Paranteau v. DeVita, 208 Conn. 515, 522-23, 544 A.2d *159634 (1988), that, for the purpose of appealability, a trial court judgment on the merits is the final judgment, notwithstanding the pendency of a postjudgment claim for attorneyÃ¢ÂÂs fees. See General Statutes ÃÂ§ 52-263.21 In Paranteau, we held that a bright-line rule as to when an appeal must be taken is preferable to a retrospective consideration of whether a postjudgment claim is so integral to the judgment on the merits that that judgment is not appealable until the postjudgment claim has been decided. We noted that such a bright-line rule would promote certainty and efficiency. Paranteau v. DeVita, supra, 522-23.
Similarly, in cases involving ÃÂ§ 52-141, it would be inappropriate for the timeliness of a complaint for setoff to depend upon a retrospective, artificial determination of the finality of the trial court judgment. Such a case-by-case approach would create uncertainty and confusion regarding both the procedural obligations of the litigants and the financial outcome in a case in which the defendant seeks to set off a tort judgment rendered against it.
For the same reasons that we find the reasoning of Paranteau persuasive in this context, we decline to rely on Preisner v. Aetna Casualty & Surety Co., supra, in our determination of the meaning of Ã¢ÂÂfinal judgmentÃ¢ÂÂ in ÃÂ§ 52-141 (b) (4). In Preisner,22 we enunciated a test *160for determining if a trial court judgment is a Ã¢ÂÂfinal judgmentÃ¢ÂÂ despite a subsequent appeal: Ã¢ÂÂIf the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs judgment is sustained [on appeal], or the appeal dismissed, the final judgment ordinarily is that of the trial court. If, however, there is reversible error, the final judgment is that of the appellate court.Ã¢ÂÂ Id., 415. Ã¢ÂÂThe finality of a judgment may, [therefore], depend upon the outcome of the pending appeal.Ã¢ÂÂ Id. This test is not useful in determining the meaning of Ã¢ÂÂfinal judgmentÃ¢ÂÂ in the context of ÃÂ§ 52-141 (b) (4), however, because the parties would not know until the outcome of an appeal whether the trial court judgment or the appellate court judgment was properly considered the Ã¢ÂÂfinal judgment.Ã¢ÂÂ
Our conclusion that the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs judgment was the Ã¢ÂÂfinal judgmentÃ¢ÂÂ for the purpose of ÃÂ§ 52-141 (b) (4) is bolstered by the fact that construing that term to refer to the judgment rendered on appeal, as PaineWebber urges, would result in an unworkable intersection of ÃÂ§ 52-141 (b) (4) and Practice Book ÃÂ§ 4009,23 which requires an appeal from a final judgment to be filed within twenty days of the issuance of notice of that judgment. For example, upon a trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs tort judgment in favor of the plaintiff, a defendant seeking to set off the judgment against a debt owed by the plaintiff to the defendant will not necessarily know within twenty-four hours if the plaintiff will appeal from the judgment. Moreover, until twenty days *161have passed, the defendant itself will not necessarily have decided, and is not required to have decided, whether to appeal from the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs judgment.
According to PaineWebberÃ¢ÂÂs reading of ÃÂ§ 52-141 (b) (4), therefore, the parties would know whether the trial court judgment was the Ã¢ÂÂfinal judgmentÃ¢ÂÂ only upon expiration of the twenty day appeal period. That statute, however, contemplates that the finality of the judgment will be known within twenty-four hours of its rendering. We, therefore, reject PaineWebberÃ¢ÂÂs construction, which would create an unpredictable and thereby unworkable rule. Cf. Fairfield Plumbing & Heating Supply Corporation v. Kosa, 220 Conn. 643, 649-51, 600 A.2d 1 (1991); Turner v. Turner, 219 Conn. 703, 712-13, 595 A.2d 297 (1991).
We conclude that the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs May, 1989 judgments on the merits were the final judgments for purposes of ÃÂ§ 52-141 (b) (4) and, therefore, that PaineWebber was required to file its complaint for setoff within twenty-four hours of those judgments. By filing its complaint for setoff in August, 1990, PaineWebber failed to comply with ÃÂ§ 52-141 (b) (4). Accordingly, the trial court properly denied PaineWebberÃ¢ÂÂs complaint for setoff.
B
PaineWebber also contends that the trial court improperly determined that PaineWebber was not entitled to a setoff on equitable grounds. We disagree.24
This court will reverse a trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs exercise of its equitable powers only if it appears that the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs decision is unreasonable or creates an injustice. Fel*162lows v. Martin, 217 Conn. 57, 67-68, 584 A.2d 458 (1991); Godiksen v. Miller, 6 Conn. App. 106, 109-10, 503 A.2d 617 (1986). Ã¢ÂÂ[EJquitable power must be exercised equitably . . . [but] [t]he determination of what equity requires in a particular case, the balancing of the equities, is a matter for the discretion of the trial court.Ã¢ÂÂ (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Reynolds v. Ramos, 188 Conn. 316, 320, 449 A.2d 182 (1982). Although PaineWebber correctly notes that the denial of a legal setoff does not preclude an award of setoff on equitable grounds; Betts v. Connecticut Life Ins. Co., 78 Conn. 442, 450-51, 62 A. 345 (1905); a trial court may grant an equitable setoff only to Ã¢ÂÂenforce the simple but clear natural equity.Ã¢ÂÂ Spurr v. Snyder, 35 Conn. 172, 174 (1868).
In this case, it was not unreasonable for the trial court to deny PaineWebberÃ¢ÂÂs motion for equitable setoff. The trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs memorandum of decision on the setoff issue stated: Ã¢ÂÂAt this time, it would be fundamentally unfair to grant [PaineWebberÃ¢ÂÂs] request for [an equitable] setoff. The Appellate Court has directed the trial court to award interest to [PaineWebber pursuant to General Statutes ÃÂ§ 52-192a] on the theory [that PaineWebber] has received a judgment in its favor providing for an ultimate recovery in excess of the offer of judgment which it made earlier in the proceedings. If the awards had been setoff at trial and one judgment rendered in favor of the defendant for eighteen cents, the plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs claim for prejudgment interest might have been viewed in a different light by the trial court and the Appellate Court.Ã¢ÂÂ We conclude that the trial court, before which the parties appeared, reasonably determined that PaineWebber, having decided not to seek setoff until it had secured an award of interest on the judgment in its favor, could not later seek to set off *163the judgment in its favor against the judgment in WintersÃ¢ÂÂ favor.25 Accordingly, we reject PaineWebberÃ¢ÂÂs claim.26
II
The Foreclosure Action
PaineWebber contends, in the foreclosure action, that the trial court improperly granted an equitable setoff of the PaineWebber judgments. Although the Appellate Court held that the trial court had not abused its discretion by granting an equitable setoff in the foreclosure action because the trial court had not been bound by its denial of a setoff in the PaineWebber action, we determine that the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs memorandum of decision is not amenable to meaningful appellate review of the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs decision to grant an equitable setoff. Accordingly, we remand this case for further articulation on that issue. See Practice Book ÃÂ§ 4061;27 see also, e.g., Lauer v. Zoning Commission, 220 Conn. 455, 473, 600 A.2d 310 (1991); Rostain v. Rostain, 213 Conn. 686, 693-95, 569 A.2d 1126 (1990).
The trial court determined that distribution of the foreclosure sale proceeds to PaineWebber in the full amount of its PaineWebber judgment, without setting off the judgment in favor of Winters, would be Ã¢ÂÂextremely inequitable.Ã¢ÂÂ Because PaineWebber did not *164move for articulation of the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs decision pursuant to Practice Book ÃÂ§ 4051,28 the entire record on which we could review PaineWebberÃ¢ÂÂs claim consists of this conclusory statement by the trial court.
Ã¢ÂÂWe have repeatedly stated that it is the appellantÃ¢ÂÂs responsibility to provide an adequate record for review. . . . Where the factual or legal basis of the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs decision is unclear, the appellant should file a motion for articulation pursuant to Practice Book ÃÂ§ 4051.Ã¢ÂÂ (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Walton v. New Hartford, 223 Conn. 155, 164-65, 612 A.2d 1153 (1992). In the absence of a motion for articulation, it would be sheer speculation for this court to assume that the trial court exercised its equitable powers unreasonably. See DiBerardino v. DiBerardino, 213 Conn. 373, 385, 568 A.2d 431 (1990).
We decline, however, to dispose of this case on the basis of PaineWebberÃ¢ÂÂs failure to move for an articulation. Rather, we exercise our authority to order a remand because this case required the trial court, presiding over two separate but related cases, to exercise its equitable powers to achieve substantial justice among the parties, and the present record provides an insufficient basis upon which to review that exercise of equitable discretion.
The judgment of the Appellate Court in Docket No. 14460 is affirmed; the judgment of the Appellate Court in Docket No. 14459 is vacated and the matter is *165remanded to that court with direction that it be remanded to the trial court for further articulation in accordance with this opinion.
In this opinion the other justices concurred.

 Although we denied the motion, filed by PaineWebber, Inc. (see footnote 3), seeking consolidation of these appeals, we consider them in one opinion because of the overlap of some issues.


 Ã¢ÂÂ[General Statutes] Sec. 52-141. set-off in action for trespass or tort, (a) In a civil action for trespass to real or personal property or for a tort, unaccompanied by force, resulting in consequential injury, a defendant may set off against any judgment rendered against him any debt which he holds, jointly or severally, against the plaintiff, subject to the conditions contained in subsections (b) and (c) of this section.
Ã¢ÂÂ(b) (1) This section shall not apply to a civil action for damages for taking property exempt from execution.
Ã¢ÂÂ(2) No debt which was acquired by a defendant by purchase or assignment after the accruing of the cause of action upon which the judgment is rendered may be allowed as a set-off under this section.
Ã¢ÂÂ(3) An assignment of the judgment by the plaintiff shall not affect the right of set-off and any such assignment shall be taken subject to the right of set-off.
Ã¢ÂÂ(4) Any such set-off shall be claimed by filing a complaint in the court in which the judgment has been rendered within twenty-four hours after final judgment.
Ã¢ÂÂ(5) No set-off may be allowed in cases where the defendant had the right of set-off on the trial of the case.
Ã¢ÂÂ(c) (1) The court shall make any proper set-off immediately if the debt claimed is admitted by the plaintiff or evidenced by judgment.
Ã¢ÂÂ(2) If a claimed set-off is not admitted or evidenced by judgment and is denied by the plaintiff, it shall not be allowed unless the defendant has instituted a suit therefor prior to the rendition of judgment in the original action. If any such suit is pending at the time of rendition of judgment for the plaintiff in the original action, the court rendering judgment shall stay execution thereon until the final termination of the suit. Upon termination of the suit, the court shall allow the set-off in the original action in accordance with the amount adjudged to be due on the set-off claim in the suit.Ã¢ÂÂ


 PaineWebber, Inc., was formerly known as Paine Webber Jackson & Curtis, Inc.


 Initially, the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of PaineWebber on its claim. The Appellate Court set aside this judgment, however, because factual issues remained, and remanded the matter. Paine Webber Jackson & Curtis, Inc. v. Winters, 13 Conn. App. 712, 722, 539 A.2d 595, cert. denied, 208 Conn. 803, 545 A.2d 1100 (1988). The jury trial was held on remand.


 Winters was awarded damages on his counterclaims alleging defamation and conversion of personal files. He also prevailed on his counterclaims alleging breach of employment contract, intentional interference with contract and intentional interference with prospective advantage, but was awarded only nominal damages on those claims.


 PaineWebber claims that creditors of Winters have attached the judgment rendered in his favor in the PaineWebber action, obligating PaineWebber to pay the full $440,000.18.


 Ã¢ÂÂ[General Statutes (Rev. to 1989)] Sec. 52-192a. offer of judgment BY PLAINTIFF. ACCEPTANCE BY DEFENDANT. COMPUTATION OF INTEREST, (a) After commencement of any civil action based upon contract or for the recovery of money only, the plaintiff may before trial file with the clerk *151of the court a written Ã¢ÂÂoffer of judgmentÃ¢ÂÂ signed by him or his attorney, directed to the defendant or his attorney, offering to settle the claim underlying the action and to stipulate to a judgment for a sum certain. The plaintiff shall give notice of the offer of settlement to the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs attorney, or if the defendant is not represented by an attorney, to the defendant himself. Within thirty days after being notified of the filing of the Ã¢ÂÂoffer of judgment,Ã¢ÂÂ the defendant or his attorney may file with the clerk of the court a written Ã¢ÂÂacceptance of offer of judgmentÃ¢ÂÂ agreeing to a stipulation for judgment as contained in plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs Ã¢ÂÂoffer of judgment.Ã¢ÂÂ Upon such filing, the clerk shall enter judgment immediately on the stipulation. If the Ã¢ÂÂoffer of judgmentÃ¢ÂÂ is not accepted within thirty days, the Ã¢ÂÂoffer of judgmentÃ¢ÂÂ shall be considered rejected and not subject to acceptance unless refiled. Any such Ã¢ÂÂoffer of judgmentÃ¢ÂÂ and any Ã¢ÂÂacceptance of offer of judgmentÃ¢ÂÂ shall be included by the clerk in the record of the case.
Ã¢ÂÂ(b) After trial the court shall examine the record to determine whether the plaintiff made an Ã¢ÂÂoffer of judgmentÃ¢ÂÂ which the defendant failed to accept. If the court ascertains from the record that the plaintiff has recovered an amount equal to or greater than the sum certain stated in his Ã¢ÂÂoffer of judgment,Ã¢ÂÂ the court shall add to the amount so recovered twelve per cent annual interest on said amount, computed from the date such offer was filed in actions commenced before October 1, 1981. In those actions commenced on or after October 1,1981, the interest shall be computed from the date the complaint in the civil action was filed with the court if the Ã¢ÂÂoffer of judgmentÃ¢ÂÂ was filed not later than eighteen months from the filing of such complaint. If such offer was filed later than eighteen months from the date of filing of the complaint, the interest shall be computed from the date the Ã¢ÂÂoffer of judgmentÃ¢ÂÂ was filed. The court may award reasonable attorneyÃ¢ÂÂs fees in an amount not to exceed three hundred fifty dollars, and shall render judgment accordingly. This section shall not be interpreted to abrogate the contractual rights of any party concerning the recovery of attorneyÃ¢ÂÂs fees in accordance with the provisions of any written contract between the parties to the action.Ã¢ÂÂ


 PaineWebberÃ¢ÂÂs complaint for setoff calculated prejudgment interest due as $244,758, plus postjudgment interest.


 In addition to denying PaineWebberÃ¢ÂÂs complaint for setoff because of its untimeliness, the trial court denied the complaint on the ground that General Statutes ÃÂ§ 52-141 was inapplicable in this case because the tort claim and the breach of contract claim had been resolved together. PaineWebber challenged this holding, as well as the untimeliness holding, in the Appellate Court, and the Appellate Court affirmed the trial court on the untimeliness ground. In this court, PaineWebber challenges the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs denial of its complaint for setoff only on the untimeliness ground. We, therefore, do not address the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs holding that ÃÂ§ 52-141 did not apply in this case.


 ""We granted certification limited to the following issues: Ã¢ÂÂ1. Did the Appellate Court improperly conclude that the Ã¢ÂÂonly issueÃ¢ÂÂ in the appeal below was to determine when a judgment is Ã¢ÂÂfinalÃ¢ÂÂ for purposes of General Statutes ÃÂ§ 52-141 (b) (4), not ruling upon Paine WebberÃ¢ÂÂs argument concerning entitlement to an equitable setoff of opposing judgments?
Ã¢ÂÂ2. Did the Appellate Court improperly fail to reverse the trial court and to order an equitable setoff of the judgments obtained by Paine Webber and by Winters, especially in view of the fact that the same trial court had ordered an equitable setoff of the same judgments in the matter of Connecticut Bank & Trust Co. v. Winters, 26 Conn. App. 317, 600 A.2d 1046 (1991)?
Ã¢ÂÂ3. Did the Appellate Court improperly conclude that the judgment in *153this matter was Ã¢ÂÂfinalÃ¢ÂÂ for purposes of General Statutes ÃÂ§ 52-141 (b) (4) at the time when the trial court rendered judgment?
Ã¢ÂÂ4. Did the Appellate Court improperly refuse to consider the issues raised in this appeal with the issues of the appeal in Connecticut Bank & Trust Co. v. Winters, supra, when both appeals involved the same issue of equitable setoff?
Ã¢ÂÂ5. Are the issues in this appeal moot if the affirmance by the Appellate Court of the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs allowance oÃÂ­ a setoff in Connecticut Bank & Trust Co. v. Winters, supra, is upheld?Ã¢ÂÂ Paine Webber Jackson & Curtis, Inc. v. Winters, 221 Conn. 912, 912-13, 602 A.2d 11 (1992).f


 The parties involved in this appeal are PaineWebber, Inc., which held a prejudgment attachment on the subject property; Union Trust Company, a judgment lienor; and Chapman, Moran, Hubbard and Zimmermann, an intervenor that held a charging lien on the judgment rendered in the PaineWebber action in favor of Winters.


 PaineWebber claims that the amount of its lien is $425,000, but the record reveals that the amount may, in fact, be $325,000. This discrepancy need not be resolved for the purpose of this appeal.


 The two most senior encumbrancers were Connecticut Bank and Trust Company, N.A., a mortgagee and the plaintiff in the foreclosure action, and Citibank, N.A., also a mortgagee. Neither is involved in this appeal.


 Because PaineWebber claimed postjudgment interest under General Statutes ÃÂ§ 52-192a in addition to prejudgment interest; see footnote 8; the trial court reserved $260,000 of foreclosure sale proceeds for PaineWebber.


 We granted certification limited to the following issues: Ã¢ÂÂ1. Did the Appellate Court improperly affirm the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs decision to set off the judgments obtained by Paine Webber and by Winters in this foreclosure action when the Appellate Court simultaneously affirmed a denial of the same request for a setoff in the Paine Webber Jackson & Curtis, Inc. v. Winters, 26 Conn. App. 322, 600 A.2d 1048 (1991), matter?
Ã¢ÂÂ2. Did the Appellate Court improperly permit other creditors of defendant Winters, junior in priority to Paine Webber, to set off judgments obtained by Paine Webber against Winters and Winters against Paine Webber, thereby reducing Paine WebberÃ¢ÂÂs claim to the foreclosure proceeds in this matter from $425,000 to $260,000?
Ã¢ÂÂ3. Did the Appellate Court improperly fail to consider the issues of this matter with the issues of the appeal in Paine Webber Jackson & Curtis, Inc. v. Winters, supra, when the same question of equitable setoff existed in both cases?Ã¢ÂÂ Connecticut Bank & Trust Co. v. Winters, 221 Conn. 911, 912, 602 A.2d 10 (1992).


 Although PaineWebber claims that Winters is effectively insolvent and that the foreclosure proceeds are the only asset from which PaineWebber might receive payment, Winters disputes that claim.


 Because the Appellate Court affirmed the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs judgment without discussing the issue of equitable setoff, we review the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs disposition of this issue, rather than the Appellate CourtÃ¢ÂÂs disposition of it. We reject PaineWebberÃ¢ÂÂs contention that the Appellate CourtÃ¢ÂÂs omission constitutes Ã¢ÂÂreversible error,Ã¢ÂÂ because the claim receives full consideration herein.


 In its brief to this court, PaineWebber acknowledged that it would withdraw its appeal in the foreclosure action if we reverse the Appellate CourtÃ¢ÂÂs affirmance of the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs denial of setoff in the PaineWebber action.
Moreover, PaineWebber contends, in both cases, that the Appellate CourtÃ¢ÂÂs failure to consider the merits of the two cases together was improper. We note that PaineWebber has not raised on appeal the Appellate CourtÃ¢ÂÂs denial of its motion to consolidate the cases. We, therefore, understand this contention as a claim that the Appellate Court, having properly denied PaineWebberÃ¢ÂÂs motion to consolidate, was nonetheless required to consider the cases together.
We reject such a claim. Even if the Appellate Court had considered the cases together, the Appellate Court would be entitled to reverse the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs exercise of its equitable powers in each of the two separate cases only if that exercise was unreasonable. Fellows v. Martin, 217 Conn. 57, 67-68, 584 A.2d 458 (1991). The Appellate CourtÃ¢ÂÂs joint consideration of the cases could not alter the fact that the two cases were tried separately in the trial court. Accordingly, even if the Appellate Court had determined, after its joint consideration of the cases, that the two decisions of the trial *156court, taken together, created an inequity, it would not thereby have been entitled to reverse the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs decisions, because the trial court properly considered the cases separately. Indeed, PaineWebber neither appealed from the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs denial of its motion to consolidate nor raised in this court or in the Appellate Court the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs failure to consider the cases together. PaineWebberÃ¢ÂÂs claim that the Appellate Court should have considered the two cases together, therefore, fails.


 PaineWebber was the defendant on WintersÃ¢ÂÂ counterclaims, which for the most part sounded in tort. See footnote 5.


 We have previously decided that, at the time a judgment is rendered in the trial court, it becomes final for the purpose of triggering a statute of limitations. Varley v. Varley, 181 Conn. 58, 60-61, 434 A.2d 312 (1980). Varley is not controlling here, however, because the twenty-four hour filing requirement of General Statutes ÃÂ§ 52-141 (b) (4) is not properly considered a statute of limitations, despite that characterization of it by the Appellate Court. Paine Webber Jackson & Curtis, Inc. v. Winters, 26 Conn. App. 322, 325, 600 A.2d 1048 (1991).
BlackÃ¢ÂÂs Law Dictionary defines Ã¢ÂÂstatute of limitationsÃ¢ÂÂ as Ã¢ÂÂ[a] statute prescribing limitations to the right of action on certain described causes of action . . . that is, declaring that no suit shall be maintained . . . within a specified period of time after the right accrued . . . .Ã¢ÂÂ BlackÃ¢ÂÂs Law Dictionary (5th Ed.). The purposes of statutes of limitation include finality, repose and avoidance of stale claims and stale evidence. See Pintavalle v. Valkanos, 216 Conn. 412, 417, 581 A.2d 1050 (1990); Zapata v. Burns, 207 Conn. 496, 508-509, 542 A.2d 700 (1988).
Unlike a statute of limitations, the pleading requirement imposed by ÃÂ§ 52-141 (b) (4) does not limit the right to bring a suit and, because of its short length, cannot have been intended to promote repose and finality or to protect against stale claims and evidence.
Finally, our decision not to characterize the twenty-four hour filing requirement as a statute of limitations is in accord with prior cases. For example, in Small v. South Norwalk Savings Bank, 205 Conn. 751, 758, 535 A.2d 1292 (1988), we impliedly recognized that a five day limitation on filing posttrial motions, imposed by Practice Book rule, is not a statute of limitations: Ã¢ÂÂWe no more feel at liberty to disregard [the five day limitation] . . . than we do to disregard an ordinary statute of limitations . . . . Ã¢ÂÂ (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) Similarly, in Cutting v. Yudkin, 137 Conn. 635, 637, 79 A.2d 823 (1951), we held that a statutory requirement that a bill of exceptions and writ of error be filed within forty-eight hours of judgment was not a statute of limitations.


 Ã¢ÂÂ[General Statutes] Sec. 52-263. appeals from superior court, exceptions. Upon the trial of all matters of fact in any cause or action in the superior court, whether to the court or jury, or before any judge thereof when the jurisdiction of any action or proceeding is vested in him, if either party is aggrieved by the decision of the court or judge upon any question or questions of law arising in the trial, including the denial of a motion to set aside a verdict, he may appeal to the court having jurisdiction from the final judgment of the court or of such judge, or from the decision of the court granting a motion to set aside a verdict, except in small claims cases, which shall not be appealable, and appeals as provided in sections 8-8 and 8-9.Ã¢ÂÂ


 In Preisner v. Aetna Casualty & Surety Co., 203 Conn. 407, 412-13, 525 A.2d 83 (1987), we determined the effect of a trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs judgment *160on the contractual entitlement of an accommodation comaker of a promissory note to indemnification when that accommodation party settled with the holder of the note during the pendency of an appeal by the underlying obligor from the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs judgment of liability. No statutory construction, therefore, was involved.


 Practice Book ÃÂ§ 4009 provides in relevant part: Ã¢ÂÂThe party appealing shall, within twenty days, except where a different period is provided by statute, from the issuance of notice of the rendition of the judgment or decision from which the appeal is taken file an appeal in the manner prescribed by Sec. 4012.Ã¢ÂÂ


 Winters contends that, in Connecticut, the right to equitable setoff exists only in contract actions and that, for that reason, the trial court properly denied PaineWebberÃ¢ÂÂs request to set off a debt judgment against a tort judgment. Because this contention falls outside the scope of the certified issues, we do not address it.


 We do not decide, however, the validity of the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs suggestion that PaineWebber would not have been entitled to interest under General Statutes ÃÂ§ 52-192a if the judgments had been set off by the trial court.


 Even if the Appellate CourtÃ¢ÂÂs decision in the foreclosure action were affirmed, that affirmance would not render moot the issues in the PaineWebber appeal, for the two cases, including the facially similar claims regarding the issue of equitable setoff in each case, involve independent controversies. We, therefore, answer the certified question raising the mootness issue in the negative. See footnote 10.


 Practice Book ÃÂ§ 4061 provides in relevant part: Ã¢ÂÂIf the court deems it necessary to the proper disposition of the cause, it may remand the case for a further articulation of the basis of the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs factual findings or decision.Ã¢ÂÂ


 Practice Book ÃÂ§ 4051 provides in relevant part: Ã¢ÂÂAny motion seeking . . . an articulation or further articulation of the decision of the trial court shall be determined by the judge of the trial court whence the appeal is taken or the reservation is made. The trial court may make such corrections or additions as are necessary for the proper presentation of the preliminary statement of issues or for the proper presentation of questions reserved . . . .Ã¢ÂÂ

"
49,7842702,7895244,"
Katz, J.
The principal issue in this appeal is whether, under the facts of this case, the plaintiff is entitled to underinsured motorist benefits, as a Ã¢ÂÂfamily memberÃ¢ÂÂ of the insured, pursuant to the business automobile insurance policy issued by the defendant to the plaintiffs corporate employer.1 The plaintiff, Michael Ceci, having sustained injuries as a pedestrian when he was struck by an underinsured motorist, sought to recover underinsured motorist benefits under a business automobile insurance policy issued by the defendant, National Indemnity Company, to Victor Ceci Refuse, Inc., a corporation operated by the plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs family. Following the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs decision confirming an arbitration award rendered in favor of the defendant, the plaintiff appealed to the Appellate Court, which affirmed the judgment of the trial court and concluded that because the policy issued to his familyÃ¢ÂÂs corporation was unambiguous, the plaintiff was not covered by it. Ceci v. National Indemnity Co., 26 Conn. App. 661, 603 A.2d 412 (1992). We granted the plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs petition for certification to appeal2 and now reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.
*167The Appellate Court opinion sets forth the following undisputed facts. Ã¢ÂÂOn September 13, 1986, the plaintiff was a pedestrian when he was struck by an underinsured motorist. He requested uninsured motorist benefits pursuant to a business automobile policy of insurance issued by the defendant to Victor Ceci Refuse, Inc. The policy was effective from July 15, 1986, through July 15,1987, and covered three pickup trucks and two trucks owned by the corporation. The policy identified Victor Ceci Refuse, Inc., as the Ã¢ÂÂnamed insuredÃ¢ÂÂ and did not identify any individual officers or employees. The policy classified the insuredÃ¢ÂÂs business as a corporation.
Ã¢ÂÂAt issue in this case are the provisions of the insurance policy that dealt with uninsured motorist coverage. According to these provisions, the defendant would pay for damages caused by an uninsured vehicle. Individuals covered by this provision included: Ã¢ÂÂ(1) you or any family member (2) anyone else occupying a covered auto or a temporary substitute for covered auto.Ã¢ÂÂ The policy defined Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂFamily memberÃ¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ as Ã¢ÂÂa person related to you by blood, marriage or adoption who is a resident of your household, including a ward or foster child.Ã¢ÂÂ The policy defined Ã¢ÂÂoccupyingÃ¢ÂÂ as Ã¢ÂÂin, upon, getting in, on or off.Ã¢ÂÂ
Ã¢ÂÂThe plaintiff submitted his claim for uninsured motorist benefits to an arbitration panel. The arbitrators denied the plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs claim for coverage, finding that because the plaintiff was neither a family member of the named insured nor occupying any of the insured vehicles, he was not an insured under the policy. The plaintiff filed an application to vacate the arbitration award. The defendant asserted a counterclaim seeking to confirm the decision of the arbitration panel. *168The trial court rendered judgment in favor of the defendant by confirming the arbitration award. The plaintiff appealed that decision to [the Appellate Court].Ã¢ÂÂ Ceci v. National Indemnity Co., supra, 662-63.
The Appellate Court agreed with the defendant that Ã¢ÂÂ[b]ecause it is clear that the plaintiff could not be related to the corporation, there was no ambiguity that would entitle him to coverage based on the presumption favoring an insured where an insurance policy is ambiguous.Ã¢ÂÂ Id., 665. The Appellate Court accepted the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs argument that a plain reading of the entire policy leads to the conclusion that a corporation could not have family members related by blood, marriage or adoption, and concluded that no reasonable interpretation of the family member provision would entitle the plaintiff to recover under this policy. Id., 665-66. We disagree.3
The provisions of the policy issued by the defendant cannot be construed in a vacuum. Chmielewski v. Aetna Casualty & Surety Co., 218 Conn. 646, 670, 591 A.2d 101 (1991). They should be construed from the perspective of a reasonable layperson in the position of the purchaser of the policy. Travelers Ins. Co. v. Kulla, 216 Conn. 390, 402, 579 A.2d 525 (1990); Allstate Ins. Co. v. Ferrante, 201 Conn. 478, 487, 518 A.2d 373 (1986); Cody v. Remington Electric Shavers, 179 Conn. 494, 497, 427 A.2d 810 (1980). This analysis is necessarily fact oriented and is not based solely upon general propositions. A determination of the meaning of the term Ã¢ÂÂfamily memberÃ¢ÂÂ in the context of the insurance policy requires careful consideration of the *169Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂsituation [of the parties] to that policy and the circumstances connected with the transaction.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ Leonard Concrete Pipe Co. v. C. W. Blakeslee & Sons, Inc., 178 Conn. 594, 598, 424 A.2d 277 (1979), quoting Ives v. Willimantic, 121 Conn. 408, 411, 185 A. 427 (1936).
This policy was prepared for the defendant by underwriter Nancy Belliveau, who used only one underinsured motorist coverage endorsement in all automobile liability policies: the one appended to the Victor Ceci Refuse, Inc. policy. Belliveau had considerable information about the insured when she prepared the policy. Belliveau knew that Victor Ceci Refuse, Inc., was a small, family operated business, and that the plaintiff is the brother of Victor Ceci, the corporationÃ¢ÂÂs sole shareholder. The plaintiff was an employee of the insured corporation and was listed as one of the three drivers on the schedule of drivers section of the application submitted to the defendant. The other drivers were family members Victor Ceci and Louis Ceci, who ran the business. Victor Ceci advised Belliveau that the drivers of the vehicles were not covered by the WorkersÃ¢ÂÂ Compensation Act because the business was owner operated.4 She knew that the five named vehicles were kept at 4 Seitz Lane, Cos Cob, which is where the business was located and where the plaintiff resided with Victor and Louis Ceci, another brother, a sister and *170their mother. Consequently, the policy endorsement had not been prepared in a vacuum. It is undisputed that Victor Ceci Refuse, Inc., was a small family owned and family operated business. It is with regard to these particular facts that we construe the policy.
The policy in effect at the time of the plaintiffs accident provided the following:
Ã¢ÂÂPART I - WORDS AND PHRASES WITH SPECIAL MEANING - READ THEM CAREFULLY
Ã¢ÂÂA. Ã¢ÂÂYouÃ¢ÂÂ and Ã¢ÂÂyourÃ¢ÂÂ mean the person or organization shown as the named insured in ITEM ONE of the declarations. . . .
Ã¢ÂÂF. Ã¢ÂÂInsuredÃ¢ÂÂ means any person or organization qualifying as an insured in the WHO IS INSURED section of the applicable insurance. Except with respect to our limit of liability, the insurance afforded applies separately to each insured who is seeking coverage or against whom a claim is made or suit is brought. . . .
Ã¢ÂÂPART IV - LIABILITY INSURANCE. . . .
Ã¢ÂÂD. WHO IS INSURED.
Ã¢ÂÂ1. You are an insured for any covered auto.
Ã¢ÂÂ2. Anyone else is an insured while using with your permission a covered auto you own, hire or borrow except . . . .Ã¢ÂÂ
The uninsured motorists insurance endorsement to the policy provided the following:
Ã¢ÂÂTHIS ENDORSEMENT CHANGES THE POLICY. PLEASE READ IT CAREFULLY.
Ã¢ÂÂUNINSURED MOTORISTS INSURANCE
Ã¢ÂÂA. WORDS AND PHRASES WITH SPECIAL MEANING. . . .
*171Ã¢ÂÂ1. Ã¢ÂÂFamily memberÃ¢ÂÂ means a person related to you by blood, marriage or adoption who is a resident of your household, including a ward or foster child. . . .
Ã¢ÂÂD. WHO IS INSURED
Ã¢ÂÂ1. You or any family member.
Ã¢ÂÂ2. Anyone else occupying a covered auto or a temporary substitute for a covered auto. The covered auto must be out of service because of its breakdown, repair, servicing, loss or destruction. ...Ã¢ÂÂ (Emphasis added.)
According to well established principles governing the construction of insurance polices, an ambiguous provision in an insurance policy will be construed to favor the insured. S & S Tobacco & Candy Co. v. Greater New York Mutual Ins. Co., 224 Conn. 313, 320, 617 A.2d 1388 (1992); Streitweiser v. Middlesex Mutual Assurance Co., 219 Conn. 371, 375, 593 A.2d 498 (1991); Schultz v. Hartford Fire Ins. Co., 213 Conn. 696, 702, 569 A.2d 1131 (1990); Beach v. Middlesex Mutual Assurance Co., 205 Conn. 246, 250, 532 A.2d 1297 (1987). The plaintiff contends that the term Ã¢ÂÂfamily membersÃ¢ÂÂ is ambiguous in the circumstances of this case because it is unclear what meaning should be attributed to the inclusion of a Ã¢ÂÂfamily memberÃ¢ÂÂ limitation in an uninsured motorists endorsement attached to a business policy issued to a corporation. Specifically, the plaintiff argues that the language in the endorsement reflects coverage to natural persons and their families, unlike the liability portion of the policy that involves only the named insured corporation.
The defendant, on the other hand, maintains that the language in the policy is clear and unambiguous because a corporation cannot have Ã¢ÂÂfamily members.Ã¢ÂÂ Because it is a distinct legal entity, a corporation can act only through its agents. Lieberman v. Reliable Refuse Co., 212 Conn. 661, 673, 563 A.2d 1013 (1989). Even though *172the plaintiff is the brother of the corporationÃ¢ÂÂs sole stockholder, he cannot be related to the corporation. The defendant contends, therefore, that the language concerning family members in a policy issued to a corporation is merely superfluous and does not serve to undermine the clarity of the policy.
Before we can construe the terms of the policy in the plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs favor as he suggests, we must first determine whether the policy provision is ambiguous. Hammer v. LumbermanÃ¢ÂÂs Mutual Casualty Co., 214 Conn. 573, 583-84, 573 A.2d 699 (1990). The only question of interpretation in this case is whether Ã¢ÂÂfamily memberÃ¢ÂÂ was intended to define persons insured under the policy. The ultimate question of intent involves an analysis regarding the coverage that the insured expected to receive and the coverage that the insurance company expected to provide as set forth in the provisions of the policy. Id., 583.
Ã¢ÂÂUnder Connecticut law, the named insured refers only to the name actually appearing on the insurance policy. Testone v. Allstate Ins. Co., 165 Conn. 126, 129-30, 328 A.2d 686 (1973).Ã¢ÂÂ Ceci v. National Indemnity Co., supra, 663-64. According to the language of the policy in this case, only Victor Ceci Refuse, Inc., was the named insured and no others were designated insured individuals. Ã¢ÂÂYouÃ¢ÂÂ and Ã¢ÂÂyourÃ¢ÂÂ referred to the Ã¢ÂÂnamed insuredÃ¢ÂÂ; Ã¢ÂÂinsuredÃ¢ÂÂ meant anyone qualifying as an insured in the Ã¢ÂÂWHO IS INSUREDÃ¢ÂÂ section. In the liability section, Ã¢ÂÂWHO IS INSUREDÃ¢ÂÂ referred solely to you or a person using a covered automobile with your permission. Accordingly, only persons injured while occupying a covered automobile would be considered insured with respect to liability insurance under the policy.
The endorsement adding uninsured motorist insurance specifically included terms not previously used, *173which the insurer cautioned had special meaning. The endorsement provided that Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂFamily memberÃ¢ÂÂ means a person related to you . . and defined Ã¢ÂÂWHO IS INSUREDÃ¢ÂÂ as Ã¢ÂÂD. ... 1. You or any family memberÃ¢ÂÂ; and Ã¢ÂÂD. . . . 2. Anyone else occupying a covered auto or a temporary substitute . . . .Ã¢ÂÂ
The parties agree that the plaintiff did not fall within section D.2. of the uninsured motorists endorsement because he was not occupying any vehicle at the time of the accident. Moreover, the plaintiff did not fall within that portion of section D.l. of that endorsement referring to Ã¢ÂÂYouÃ¢ÂÂ because he was not the named insured or a designated insured. Thus, the plaintiff could not recover underinsured benefits unless he was a Ã¢ÂÂfamily memberÃ¢ÂÂ of the corporation.
The defendant argues that the inclusion of family members in a business policy did not make the policy ambiguous. We disagree. An endorsement that specifically added coverage for Ã¢ÂÂfamily members,Ã¢ÂÂ as did this one, would reasonably be understood as providing uninsured motorist insurance for members of the Ceci family independent of whether they were occupying a covered automobile at the time of injury. Ã¢ÂÂIt is a basic principle of insurance law that policy language will be construed as laymen would understand it and not according to the interpretation of sophisticated underwriters, and that ambiguities in contract documents are resolved against the party responsible for its drafting; the policyholderÃ¢ÂÂs expectations should be protected as long as they are objectively reasonable from the laymanÃ¢ÂÂs point of view.Ã¢ÂÂ Cody v. Remington Electric Shavers, supra, 497.
The premise behind the rule is simple. Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂThe party who actually does the writing of an instrument will presumably be guided by his own interests and goals in the transaction. He may choose shadings of expression, *174words more specific or more imprecise, according to the dictates of these interests.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ Simses v. North American Co. for Life & Health Ins., 175 Conn. 77, 85, 394 A.2d 710 (1978), quoting Ravitch v. Stollman Poultry Farms, Inc., 165 Conn. 135, 146 n.8, 328 A.2d 711 (1973). Ã¢ÂÂA further, related rationale for the rule is that Ã¢ÂÂ[sjince one who speaks or writes, can by exactness of expression more easily prevent mistakes in meaning, than one with whom he is dealing, doubts arising from ambiguity are resolved in favor of the latter.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ Simses v. North American Co. for Life & Health Ins., supra, quoting 4 S. Williston, Contracts (3d Ed. Jaeger 1961) ÃÂ§ 621, pp. 760-61.
The language relating to Ã¢ÂÂfamily membersÃ¢ÂÂ in a policy insuring a corporation was not required. The defendant could have omitted section D.l. of the uninsured motorists endorsement of this corporate auto policy.5 Without this section, there would have been no ambiguity. Additionally, the defendant could have alerted the insured to the lack of personal coverage under the policy so that the Ceci family could have pursued alternate avenues for coverage of family members who could be injured by an underinsured motorist other than while driving in one of the five corporate vehicles. For example, the insurance policy could have identified the corporate officers, Victor and Louis Ceci, or the sole stockholder, Victor Ceci, as a Ã¢ÂÂdesignated insured.Ã¢ÂÂ This would have easily removed any ambiguity.
Because corporations do not have families, uninsured motorist endorsements containing family member lan*175guage should not be appended to business automobile liability insurance policies. If they are, then, in keeping with the consumer oriented spirit of the rules of insurance policy construction, the claimed ambiguity should be construed from the standpoint of the reasonable layperson6 in the position of the insured and not according to the interpretation of trained underwriters. Cody v. Remington Electric Shavers, supra.
By inserting a family member provision in a business policy, the defendant has left the Cecis in the unenviable position of having to divine the meaning and purpose of the family member language in the context of the policy. This is precisely the problem that the rules of insurance policy construction were designed to avoid. See General Statutes ÃÂ§ÃÂ§ 38a-297 through 38a-299 (insurance coverage shall be Ã¢ÂÂreadily understandableÃ¢ÂÂ). The position proposed by the defendant and adopted by the Appellate Court, that only those persons covered by section D.2. of the endorsement are entitled to underinsured benefits, renders section D.l. of the endorsement meaningless. Although some jurisdictions, as cited by the defendant,7 are not troubled by an interpretation of an insurance policy that creates a nullity of some provisions, we have consistently stated that Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ[i]f it is reasonably possible to do so, every provision of an insurance policy must be given operative effectÃ¢ÂÂ Kelly v. Figueiredo, 223 Conn. 31, 36, 610 A.2d 1296 (1992), quoting Streitweiser v. Middlesex Mutual Assur*176ance Co., supra, 376; Ã¢ÂÂbecause parties ordinarily do not insert meaningless provisions in their agreements.Ã¢ÂÂ Connecticut Co. v. Division 125, 147 Conn. 608, 617, 164 A.2d 413 (1960); A. M. Larson Co. v. Lawlor Ins. Agency, Inc., 153 Conn. 618, 622, 220 A.2d 32 (1966).
The endorsement attached to the policy issued to Victor Ceci Refuse, Inc., is used by the defendant in all of its business policies. The defendant could have clarified or omitted the problematic language to provide notice to the Cecis of the precise nature of the coverage that was being purchased. It failed to do so, and instead highlighted these significant changes to the insured, thereby creating the ambiguity in the policy. Ã¢ÂÂThis is the kind of case that has been described as Ã¢ÂÂone where no principle of law is involved, but only the meaning of careless and slovenly documents.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ Robinhorne Construction Corporation v. Snyder, 47 Ill. 2d 349, 358, 265 N.E.2d 670 (1970). Having caused the problem, the defendant cannot now ignore it.
The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded to the Appellate Court with direction to remand the case to the trial court with direction to render judgment (1) granting the plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs application to vacate the arbitration award, and (2) denying the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs application to confirm the award.
In this opinion Peters, C. J., Berdon and Norcott, Js., concurred.

 Uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage is governed by General Statutes ÃÂ§ 38-175c, now recodified as General Statutes ÃÂ§ 38a-336. Ã¢ÂÂ[Statutory provisions relating expressly to uninsured motorist coverage apply also to underinsured motorists.Ã¢ÂÂ American Motorists Ins. Co. v. Gould, 213 Conn. 625, 628, 569 A.2d 1105 (1990).


 Certification was granted limited to the following issue: Ã¢ÂÂDid the Appellate Court properly determine that, under the facts of this case, the plain*167tiff was not entitled to uninsured motorist insurance benefits pursuant to the business auto policy issued by the defendant?Ã¢ÂÂ Ceci v. National Indemnity Co., 221 Conn. 927, 608 A.2d 689 (1992).


 Issues of uninsured motorist coverage are required to be arbitrated. Bodner v. United Services Automobile Assn., 222 Conn. 480, 488, 610 A.2d 1212 (1992). Ã¢ÂÂIn reviewing [such] compulsory arbitration cases, this court must conduct a de novo review of the arbitratorsÃ¢ÂÂ interpretation and application of the law.Ã¢ÂÂ Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Co. v. Huntley, 223 Conn. 22, 26, 610 A.2d 1292 (1992).


 Victor Ceci believed that his owner operated business was not eligible for workersÃ¢ÂÂ compensation coverage. At the time of the plaintiffs accident, the relevant workersÃ¢ÂÂ compensation provision stated: Ã¢ÂÂ(5) Ã¢ÂÂEmployeeÃ¢ÂÂ . . . shall not be construed to include . . . (c) a member of the employerÃ¢ÂÂs family dwelling in his house; but, if in any contract of insurance the wages or salary of a member of the employerÃ¢ÂÂs family dwelling in his house is included in the payroll on which the premium is based, then such person shall, in the event of his sustaining an injury arising out of and in the course of his employment, be deemed an employee and compensated accordingly. . . General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) ÃÂ§ 31-275 (5) (C), now recodified and reorganized as General Statutes ÃÂ§ 31-275 (9) (B) (iii). Because it is only Victor CeciÃ¢ÂÂs communication to Belliveau that is relevant to this analysis, we need not address the accuracy of his belief.


 The plaintiff also argues that it would be a violation of public policy for an insurer to collect a premium for coverage that is nonexistent. A separate uninsured motorist premium of $58 per vehicle had been paid by Victor Ceci Refuse, Inc. The uninsured motorist benefits, however, were provided through section D.2. of the policy endorsement; therefore, even were we to find the Ã¢ÂÂfamily memberÃ¢ÂÂ provision of section D.l a nullity, this interpretation would not render the coverage for each vehicle illusory.


 When construing an ambiguous provision of an insurance policy, we look to the expectations of the purchaser of the policy. Travelers Inc. Co. v. Kulla, 216 Conn. 390, 402, 579 A.2d 525 (1990). Indeed, had the Cecis been forced to provide an interpretation of Ã¢ÂÂfamily members,Ã¢ÂÂ they had their two personal policies, issued by Royal Indemnity Company and Aetna Casualty and Surety Company, each of which contained the Ã¢ÂÂfamily memberÃ¢ÂÂ language, to consult.


 See, e.g., Hogan v. Mayor & Aldermen of Savannah, 171 Ga. App. 671, 320 S.E.2d 555 (1984); Polzin v. Phoenix of Hartford Ins. Cos., 5 Ill. App. 3d 84, 283 N.E.2d 324 (1972); Sears v. Wilson, 10 Kan. App. 2d 494, 704 P.2d 389 (1985).

Borden, J.,
concurring. I view this case somewhat differently from and more narrowly than does the majority. In my view, this case involves the clash of two competing and, in the context of this case, inconsistent canons of construction of insurance policies: (1) unambiguous language must be given its plain meaning; and (2) a policy should not be interpreted so as to render any part of it superfluous.
*177It is difficult for me to conclude, even in this factual context, that the policy provision at issue is ambiguous. One simply cannot be a Ã¢ÂÂfamily memberÃ¢ÂÂ of a corporation. At the same time, construing the provision in accordance with its plain meaning clearly renders the Ã¢ÂÂfamily memberÃ¢ÂÂ clause superfluous.
Thus, if we follow canon (1) above, the defendant would prevail; if we follow canon (2), the plaintiff would prevail. In order to decide this case, therefore, we have to violate one of the two canons. Because the defendant is charged with having Ã¢ÂÂdraftedÃ¢ÂÂ the policy language in question, by virtue of the underwriter having appended the inapt endorsement, I would opt to follow canon (2) and violate canon (1). I therefore join in the judgment of the court.

Berdon, J.
The principal issue raised in this appeal is whether the trial court correctly dismissed the named plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs claim for damages caused by a highway defect because the statutory notice to the town made reference to the wrong statute.1
This action arises out of an automobile accident that occurred on January 6,1987, on a highway maintained by the defendant town of Old Saybrook. The plaintiff, John Pratt, alleged that his automobile Ã¢ÂÂstruck a large patch of ice extending across the southerly travel portion of the road causing the plaintiff to lose control of his vehicle, which crossed over the north bound lane, *179skidded off the road and collided with a tree . . . .Ã¢ÂÂ He also alleged that as a result of the accident he suffered serious injuries, including a brain injury that has rendered him quadriplegic. On March 24,1987, he furnished the town with written notice of the accident. Thereafter, the plaintiff2 instituted this action against the town and the other defendants.3
The town moved to dismiss the count pertaining to it on the ground that the notice it had received was defective. The notice incorrectly stated that it was being given pursuant to General Statutes ÃÂ§ 7-465,4 the municipal employee indemnification statute. It failed to make reference to the correct statute, General Statutes ÃÂ§ 13a-149,5 the municipal highway defect statute. *180The trial court held that the plaintiff had failed to satisfy the notice requirement of ÃÂ§ 13a-149, which is a condition precedent to recovery, and granted the motion to dismiss the action against the town. The plaintiff appealed to the Appellate Court. We transferred the matter to this court pursuant to Practice Book ÃÂ§ 4023 and General Statutes ÃÂ§ 51-199 (c).
We recently held pursuant to the Tort Reform Act of 19866 Ã¢ÂÂthat an action under the highway defect statute, ÃÂ§ 13a-149, is a plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs exclusive remedy against a municipality or other political subdivision Ã¢ÂÂfor damages resulting from injury to any person or property by means of a defective road or bridge.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ Sanzone v. Board of Police Commissioners, 219 Conn. 179, 192, 592 A.2d 912 (1991). Therefore, a town may not be held liable for damages caused by highway defects under ÃÂ§ 7-465 (a), since this would allow a plaintiff to circumvent the requirements of ÃÂ§ 13a-149 by suing a municipal employee and seeking indemnification from the town. Id.
Under ÃÂ§ 13a-149, the plaintiff must provide statutory notice within ninety days of the accident in order for an action to lie for damages caused by a defective highway that the town must maintain. Ã¢ÂÂ[T]he notice which the statute prescribes comprehends five essential elements: (a) written notice of the injury; (b) a general description of that injury; (c) the cause; (d) the time [and date], and (e) the place thereof.Ã¢ÂÂ Marino v. East Haven, 120 Conn. 577, 579, 182 A. 225 (1935). In its motion to dismiss, the town failed to claim that the above five essential elements were not included in the notice.7 The townÃ¢ÂÂs only claim is that the notice was insufficient as a matter of law to support an action under the highway defect statute because it incorrectly cited ÃÂ§ 7-465 *181rather than ÃÂ§ 13a-149. The trial court concluded that the incorrect citation was the equivalent of giving no notice to the town. If this were the case, the plaintiff would be barred from recovery. See Sanzone v. Board of Police Commissioners, supra, 198 (Ã¢ÂÂ[t]he plaintiff who fails within ninety days to provide the municipality with the statutorily required notice will be barred from any recoveryÃ¢ÂÂ).
We disagree with the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs conclusion that the notice required by ÃÂ§ 13a-149 was not given simply because the plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs written notice made reference to a different statute.
*182First, there is no statutory requirement that the notice specify the statute relied upon to support the cause of action. Additionally, the town advances no practical reason why we should import such a requirement by judicial gloss. Furthermore, and more importantly, the town does not claim that it was misled or otherwise prejudiced by the plaintiffs mistake.
In determining whether the notice is sufficient, we must look to the purpose of the statute. Sizer v. Waterbury, 113 Conn. 145, 157-58, 154 A. 639 (1931); Bassin v. Stamford, 26 Conn. App. 534, 539, 602 A.2d 1044 (1992). The purpose of the notice requirement is not to set a trap for the unwary or to place an impediment in the way of an injured party who has an otherwise meritorious claim. Rather, the purpose of notice is to allow the municipality to make a proper investigation into the circumstances surrounding the claim in order to protect its financial interests. Wethersfield v. National Fire Ins. Co., 145 Conn. 368, 372, 143 A.2d 454 (1958). More specifically, as we recently stated in Sanzone v. Board of Police Commissioners, supra, 198, the Ã¢ÂÂstatutory notice assists a town in settling claims promptly in order to avoid the expenses of litigation and encourages prompt investigation of conditions that may endanger public safety, as well as giving the town an early start in assembling evidence for its defense against meritless claims.Ã¢ÂÂ We find that the notice given in this case served those purposes, notwithstanding the fact that it misstated the statutory section upon which the claim was predicated.
Finally, it is not without significance that the legislature provided a liberal saving clause in order to validate the content of a defective notice. Section 13a-149 provides that no notice Ã¢ÂÂshall be held invalid or insufficient by reason of an inaccuracy in describing the injury or in stating the time, place or cause of its occurrence, if it appears that there was no intention to mislead or *183that such town, city, corporation or borough was not in fact misled thereby.Ã¢ÂÂ Although it is limited in terms of the types of defects covered, this clause demonstrates that the legislature intended that compliance with the notice requirement be liberally construed in favor of the plaintiff. See Isaac v. Mount Sinai Hospital, 210 Conn. 721, 728, 557 A.2d 116 (1989) (citing Johnson v. Sikes, 56 Conn. 589, 596 [1888], in recognition that Ã¢ÂÂa very liberal construction is given to saving statuteÃ¢ÂÂ); Builders Service Corporation v. Planning & Zoning Commission, 208 Conn. 267, 276, 545 A.2d 530 (1988) (a court should consider a statute as a whole, reconciling its separate provisions so that a reasonable overall interpretation is achieved).
The legislatureÃ¢ÂÂs intention that ÃÂ§ 13a-149 should be liberally construed is made even clearer when this statute is compared with General Statutes ÃÂ§ 13a-144, the state highway liability statute. The latter statute requires the same content for statutory notice as the municipal highway liability statuteÃ¢ÂÂa description of the injury, the cause, and the time and placeÃ¢ÂÂbut it does not provide a saving clause. This court recently held in Bresnan v. Frankel, 224 Conn. 23, 26 n.3, 615 A.2d 1040 (1992), that the state highway notice requirement must be strictly construed since ÃÂ§ 13a-144, unlike ÃÂ§ 13a-149, does not contain a saving clause. A necessary corollary to this is that the municipal highway notice requirement should be liberally construed since it, unlike ÃÂ§ 13a-144, does contain a saving clause.
The town also argues that the notice was legally insufficient because the plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs original complaint sought damages based upon nuisance as well as negligence against the town.8 Since ÃÂ§ 13a-149 provides an *184exclusive remedy, the town argues, the inclusion of a nuisance claim strengthens the conclusion that the plaintiff was proceeding under ÃÂ§ 7-465 rather than ÃÂ§ 13a-149.9
The town cites no authority to support the claim that the plaintiffs allegation of nuisance somehow carved into stone the nature of the notice. The fact remains that every essential element of the notice required under ÃÂ§ 13a-149 was furnished to the town, and that only some of those elements are required in an action for indemnification under ÃÂ§ 7-465.10 We refuse to invalidate the plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs notice as a matter of law merely because the plaintiffs complaint sought damages pursuant to the alternative theory of nuisance. See Dreier v. UpJohn Co., 196 Conn. 242, 245, 492 A.2d 164 (1985) (Ã¢ÂÂ[ujnder our pleading practice, a plaintiff is permitted to advance alternative or even inconsistent theories of liability against one or more defendants in a single complaintÃ¢ÂÂ).
The trial court also dismissed the complaint because the plaintiff failed to allege both that the town Ã¢ÂÂhas a., statutory duty to maintain the roads in Old Saybrook,Ã¢ÂÂ and that he Ã¢ÂÂsent statutorily required *185notice underÃ¢ÂÂ ÃÂ§ 13a-149. (Emphasis in original.) The town has not, however, pursued either of these reasons to sustain the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs dismissal of the action against it, so we will not consider them. We note in passing that a motion to dismiss is not designed to test the legal sufficiency of a complaint in terms of whether it states a cause of action. That should be done, instead, by a motion to strike; see BaskinÃ¢ÂÂs Appeal from Probate, 194 Conn. 635, 640, 484 A.2d 934 (1984); the practical difference being that if a motion to strike is granted, the party whose pleading is stricken is given an opportunity to replead in order to avoid a harsh result. Id.; see also Practice Book ÃÂ§ 157.
The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings.
In this opinion the other justices concurred.

 Because of our disposition of this appeal, we need not address the named plaintiffs additional claim that the trial court erred in failing to follow the law of the case.


 Suzanne Wilson, the mother of John Pratt, was joined as a plaintiff in the action seeking damages against the town in a separate count. That count was stricken by the trial court and is not at issue before this court. References to the plaintiff are to the named plaintiff, John Pratt.


 The plaintiff also sought damages against the defendants Willi J. Benoit and Toni Benoit, who were in possession and control of property adjoining the public highway at the time of the plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs accident. The third count of the complaint alleged that these defendants developed their property in such a way as to divert the flow of water from their property onto the highway, thereby creating a nuisance that resulted in the injury to the plaintiff. The fourth count alleged negligence against these defendants for diverting the water and creating a dangerous condition on the highway. In the fifth count, the plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs mother alleged nuisance and negligence against these defendants and sought recovery of past and future medical expenses.


 General Statutes ÃÂ§ 7-465 makes municipalities liable for certain damages caused by their employees to third parties in the course of their duties as employees.


 General Statutes ÃÂ§ 13a-149 provides: Ã¢ÂÂAny person injured in person or property by means of a defective road or bridge may recover damages from the party bound to keep it in repair. ... No action for any such injury shall be maintained against any town, city, corporation or borough, unless written notice of such injury and a general description of the same, and of the cause thereof and of the time and place of its occurrence, shall, within ninety days thereafter be given to a selectman or the clerk of such town, or to the clerk of such city or borough .... No notice given under the provisions of this section shall be held invalid or insufficient by reason of an inaccuracy in describing the injury or in stating the time, place or cause of its occurrence, if it appears that there was no intention to mislead or that such town, city, corporation or borough was not in fact misled thereby.Ã¢ÂÂ

JOHN PRATTÃ¢ÂÂ


 In the first count of the original complaint, the plaintiffs John Pratt and his mother sought damages against the town based upon nuisance. In the second count, these plaintiffs sought damages against the town based upon negligence. In response to a request to revise filed by the town, the *184complaint was amended. In counts one and two of the revised complaint, John Pratt sued the town for nuisance and negligence, respectively. In count three, his mother sued the town for nuisance and negligence. The plaintiffs further amended their complaint on their own motion. The amended revised complaint omitted any allegations of nuisance against the town.


 To the same end, the town points to the fact that the named plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs mother attempted to recover damages against it, while General Statutes ÃÂ§ 13a-149 authorizes recovery only by the injured party.


 General Statutes ÃÂ§ 7-465 provides in relevant part: Ã¢ÂÂNo action for personal physical injuries or damages to real or personal property shall be maintained against such municipality and employee jointly unless such action is commenced within two years after the cause of action therefor arose nor unless written notice of the intention to commence such action and of the time when and the place where the damages were incurred or sustained has been filed with the clerk of such municipality within six months after such cause of action has accrued.Ã¢ÂÂ

Norcott, J.
This is an appeal from the judgment of the trial court, Hon. Joseph F. Morelli, state trial referee, finding the defendant, Hal Kirshner, to be the father of the child of the plaintiff, Mary Miller, and ordering the defendant to pay a support arrearage, weekly child support until the childÃ¢ÂÂs eighteenth birthday and attorneyÃ¢ÂÂs fees. The defendant claims that the trial court improperly: (1) admitted the results of a human leukocyte antigen (HLA) test of the defendant; (2) evaluated the credibility of the witnesses by concluding that the plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs testimony was more credible than that of the defendant and by ignoring the testimony of one of the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs witnesses; (3) awarded attorneyÃ¢ÂÂs fees to the plaintiff; (4) determined the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs liability for past child support; and (5) imposed new financial obligations on the defendant *188in an amended memorandum of decision on financial issues. The plaintiff filed a separate appeal claiming that the trial court had improperly denied her motion for an allowance for attorneyÃ¢ÂÂs fees to defend this appeal. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.
The relevant facts are as follows. On May 21, 1986, the plaintiff petitioned the Superior Court to establish the paternity of a child born to her on April 21,1985. The parties agreed to try the issues of paternity and support separately. After a trial on the issue of paternity, the trial court found that the defendant was the father of the plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs child and that he was responsible for the childÃ¢ÂÂs support and maintenance. The trial court then heard evidence relating to financial issues and ordered that the defendant pay weekly child support, medical expenses, child support arrearage from the time of the childÃ¢ÂÂs birth and attorneyÃ¢ÂÂs fees.
The defendant appealed the judgment of the trial court regarding both paternity and support to the Appellate Court. The plaintiff then filed a corrected motion in the trial court for an allowance to defend the appeal seeking attorneyÃ¢ÂÂs fees in advance of the appeal.1 The trial court denied this motion with prejudice. The plaintiff appealed the denial of that motion to the Appellate Court. We transferred both the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs appeal and the plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book ÃÂ§ 4023 and General Statutes ÃÂ§ 51-199 (c). Further facts will be discussed as they become relevant.
*189I
The defendant first claims that the trial court improperly admitted into evidence the results of an HLA test performed on the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs blood because: (1) a contrary earlier pretrial ruling of a coordinate judge constituted the law of the case; (2) the test results were improperly admitted into evidence by retroactively applying General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) ÃÂ§ 46b-168 (b), as amended by Public Acts 1989, No. 89-360, ÃÂ§ 41; and (3) the testing violated his rights under the fourth and fifth amendments to the United States constitution. We disagree.
The following facts are relevant to this claim. On June 20, 1986, after the plaintiff had petitioned the Superior Court for a determination of paternity, the defendant moved for an order that the plaintiff, the plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs child and the defendant submit to blood tests pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) ÃÂ§ 46b-168.2 The parties subsequently agreed to submit to blood tests before an order was entered. The defendant signed a consent form that stated that the blood taken would be tested for multiple factors and if exclusion from paternity could not be demonstrated the likelihood of paternity would be calculated. These blood tests included an HLA test. The results did not exclude the defendant from paternity and determined that the likelihood of paternity was 99.9 percent.
*190The defendant subsequently filed a motion in limine for an order precluding the plaintiff from introducing the results of his HLA test into evidence on the ground that the test was conducted on his tissue whereas he had consented only to a blood test. After a hearing, the trial court, Hon. Julius J. Kremski, state trial referee, ordered that Ã¢ÂÂ[t]he plaintiff may not utilize the results of the tissue testing because the parties only agreed to a blood test.Ã¢ÂÂ
Following this ruling, the plaintiff filed an amended motion for additional paternity testing and a motion in limine to admit the test results. At a hearing on the plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs motions, the trial court heard the testimony of Herbert Silver, the physician who had supervised the blood testing procedure, who testified that HLA testing was performed on components of blood and that none of the blood components are considered to be tissue. Judge Kremski then denied without prejudice the plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs amended motion for paternity testing because the plaintiff had not shown the need for additional testing. The trial court concluded that Ã¢ÂÂ[t]he court is not aware of any basis for considering that the . . . test contained or involved tissue testing, however, the court is not foreclosing the [defendant] from presenting evidence to the contrary at a future hearing. Further, the court is not foreclosing the [plaintiff] from presenting evidence that a need for the additional blood test requested by this motion is necessary.Ã¢ÂÂ The trial court also denied the plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs motion in limine to admit the results of the blood test stating that the issue of the admissibility of evidence was better left for the time of trial.
During the trial, the results of the HLA test were admitted into evidence by Judge Morelli over the objection of the defendant. On the basis of testimony presented, the blood test results, the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs offer to pay for an abortion and later to include the plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs *191child in his will, as well as a visual comparison of the child with the defendant, the trial court found the defendant to be the father of the plaintiffs child.3
A
The defendant contends that the decision by Judge Morelli to admit into evidence the results of the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs HLA test effectively overturned the earlier ruling of Judge Kremski, who had granted the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs motion in limine to exclude the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs HLA test. The defendant argues that, under the doctrine of the law of the case, the earlier ruling was binding on the judge at the subsequent trial and that there was no cause for review or reversal of that ruling. We do not agree.
Ã¢ÂÂThe law of the case is not written in stone but is a flexible principle of many facets adaptable to the exigencies of the different situations in which it may be invoked. . . . [I]t expresses the practice of judges generally to refuse to reopen what has been decided and is not a limitation on their power. . . . Where a matter has previously been ruled upon interlocutorily, the court in a subsequent proceeding in the case may treat that decision as the law of the case, if it is of the opinion that the issue was correctly decided, in the absence of some new or overriding circumstance.Ã¢ÂÂ (Emphasis added.) Breen v. Phelps, 186 Conn. 86, 99, 439 A.2d 1066 (1982). Nonetheless, Ã¢ÂÂ[w]e observed in Breen that *192the law of the case doctrine is not one of unbending rigor when we said: Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂA judge is not bound to follow the decisions of another judge made at an earlier stage of the proceedings, and if the same point is again raised he has the same right to reconsider the question as if he had himself made the original decision.Ã¢ÂÂ Santoro v. Kleinberger, 115 Conn. 631, 638, 163 A. 107 (1932).Ã¢ÂÂ [Breen v. Phelps, supra,] 98 . . . .Ã¢ÂÂ Rosenblit v. Danaher, 206 Conn. 125, 132-33, 537 A.2d 145 (1988).
We are not persuaded, however, that the doctrine of the law of the case is even in issue in the matter before us. The defendantÃ¢ÂÂs argument fails to account for Judge KremskiÃ¢ÂÂs second ruling, responding to the plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs motion for paternity testing and motion in limine. Contrary to the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs contention, Judge KremskiÃ¢ÂÂs first ruling on the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs motion in limine did not state that the HLA test results would be inadmissible, but rather precluded the plaintiff from using the results of tissue testing. The second ruling on the plaintiffs motion for paternity testing, however, specifically acknowledged expert testimony that HLA testing was performed on blood, not tissue, and expressly concluded that neither party would be foreclosed from presenting further evidence at trial concerning the testÃ¢ÂÂs admissibility. Rather than definitively barring the admission of the HLA test results, the record reveals that Judge KremskiÃ¢ÂÂs rulings merely deferred to a later date a final decision on their admissibility.
The only definitive decision regarding the admissibility of the HLA test results was that of Judge Morelli at trial. The trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs decision, consequently, did not Ã¢ÂÂreopen what ha[d] been decided.Ã¢ÂÂ Breen v. Phelps, supra, 99. We conclude that the doctrine of the law of the case does not apply. The defendant cannot, therefore, prevail in his argument that the trial court improperly reversed a pretrial ruling of a coordinate judge that stated the law of the case.
*193B
The defendant next argues that the trial court improperly retroactively applied General Statutes ÃÂ§ 46b-168, as amended by No. 89-360, ÃÂ§ 41, of the 1989 Public Acts in admitting the results of the HLA test. At the time the parties agreed to submit to blood tests, ÃÂ§ 46b-168 did not specifically provide for HLA testing. Rather, it stated that the court could order Ã¢ÂÂblood grouping testsÃ¢ÂÂ and that it could admit the results of these tests into evidence only if they established definite exclusion of the putative father from paternity. See footnote 2. Public Act 89-360, however, amended ÃÂ§ 46b-168 to authorize the court to order genetic tests, including an HLA test, in a paternity action and to admit the test results either to establish exclusion from paternity or as evidence of paternity.4
*194The essence of the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs argument appears to be that, because the results of the HLA test did not definitively exclude paternity, they could have been admitted only pursuant to a retroactive application of ÃÂ§ 46b-168 as amended. The defendant contends that this retroactive application of the statute is unwarranted because the statutory amendment affects the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs substantive rights. The defendantÃ¢ÂÂs reliance on the amended ÃÂ§ 46b-168 as the sole basis for admission of the HLA test results, however, is misplaced.5
At the time the parties submitted to the blood tests, ÃÂ§ 46b-168 defined the body of evidence, blood grouping tests, that would be inadmissible in a paternity action unless the test results definitively excluded the defendant as the father of the child. Section 46b-168 did not, however, govern the admissibility of the results of all paternity tests; rather, it barred blood grouping tests from being introduced into evidence if they did not meet the statutory criterion. Prior to the enactment of Public Act 89-360, however, this court had concluded that HLA tests were not blood grouping tests within the meaning of ÃÂ§ 46b-168. Their admissibility into evidence, therefore, was not governed by ÃÂ§ 46b-168 but, rather, by common law rules of evidence. Moore v. McNamara, 201 Conn. 16, 28-29, 513 A.2d 660 (1986).
In Moore, this court noted that the legislature, when ÃÂ§ 46b-168 was originally passed, did not contemplate technology as accurate as HLA testing has proven to be. We stated that Ã¢ÂÂit appears unlikely that the 1957 legislature intended its statute to prohibit the admission in evidence of test results obtained by then unknown techniques such as HLA testing capable of achieving *195a decidedly higher probability of exclusion.Ã¢ÂÂ Id., 29. Although in Moore we did not reach the issue of whether HLA testing was admissible under common law evidentiary rules regarding scientific techniques; see Frye v. United States, 293 F. 1013 (D.C. App. 1923); we did note that Ã¢ÂÂcombined blood grouping and HLA testing has attained general acceptance in the scientific community as a means of testing for paternity.Ã¢ÂÂ Moore v. McNamara, supra, 31.
At the time of trial in this case, therefore, judicial decisions had supported the admissibility of HLA tests and had held that the admissibility of such tests was not controlled by the original provisions of ÃÂ§ 46b-168. See id.; Miller v. Miller, 40 Conn. Sup. 66, 69, 481 A.2d 428 (1984); Hogan v. Roberge, Superior Court, judicial district of Hartford-New Britain, geographical area number thirteen, Docket No. FA 13-425 (November 24, 1984) (11 Conn. L. Trib. No. 21, pp. 10, 12 [1985]); see also Palomba v. Gray, 208 Conn. 21, 36-37, 543 A.2d 1331 (1988) (Shea, J., concurring) (Ã¢ÂÂ[t]he use of these new techniques [HLA testing] has raised to such a high level the ability of the scientific community to identify the father of a child whose paternity is disputed that the resolution of such an important issue should no longer be had without such scientific testimonyÃ¢ÂÂ). Consequently, the trial court, at the time of this action, was not restricted to admitting the HLA tests pursuant to the amended language of ÃÂ§ 46b-168 and the record contains no indication that the court relied on a retroactive application of ÃÂ§ 46b-168 as amended to authorize the admission into evidence of the HLA test results. As the defendant has raised no objection to the admissibility of the HLA test under common law rules of evidence; Moore v. McNamara, supra, 30; we conclude that the test results were properly admitted.
The defendant maintains that, at the time he consented to the blood test, he believed it would be limited to blood grouping tests and that he did not consent to *196an HLA test. Such a belief, however, is no basis for excluding the test results from evidence. At any future trial, the court could order the same test under ÃÂ§ 46b-168 as amended and the results would be admissible. See, e.g., id., 34. We conclude, therefore, that the defendant has failed to establish his second claim, that the trial court improperly retroactively applied ÃÂ§ 46b-168 as amended to him.
C
The defendant next argues that the HLA test results were improperly admitted into evidence because the performance of the test violated the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs rights under the fourth and fifth amendments to the United States constitution. The defendant maintains that he did not consent to a tissue test, which he claims an HLA test is, and that the test, therefore, violated his fourth amendment right to be free from unwarranted intrusions and his fifth amendment right against self-incrimination.
The facts of this case do not support the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs claim. The defendant moved for and voluntarily submitted to a blood test. The consent form signed by the defendant stated Ã¢ÂÂI have been informed that the blood collected from me will be tested for multiple factors and that if an exclusion cannot be demonstrated the likelihood of paternity will be calculated.Ã¢ÂÂ The defendant contends that he believed his consent to mean that he was submitting only to those tests that were admissible under ÃÂ§ 46b-168 as it provided at the time he agreed to the test. We have concluded above, however, that ÃÂ§ 46b-168 did not define the full scope of paternity tests routinely performed and admissible into evidence, and we see no reason to limit the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs consent to that which he subjectively believed the law was at the time he signed it. In Moore v. McNamara, supra, 31, this court noted that the discovery of the *197HLA system presented the impetus to use HLA test data as evidence of paternity and Ã¢ÂÂthat the decided trend in other jurisdictions [was] toward admission of HLA test results as evidence of paternity.Ã¢ÂÂ (Emphasis added.)
We conclude that when the defendant consented to have his blood tested not simply to establish exclusion from paternity but also to calculate the likelihood of paternity, such consent encompassed HLA testing. Therefore, the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs argument that his constitutional rights under the fourth and fifth amendments were violated because he did not consent to an HLA test is without merit.
II
The defendant next argues that the trial court improperly found that the plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs testimony was more credible than his and improperly ignored the testimony of defense witness Naomi Levine. We disagree.
At trial, the plaintiff testified that she and the defendant had begun seeing each other socially and first had sexual relations sometime in May, 1984. The plaintiff also testified that she had been with the defendant continuously between July 3 and July 5, 1984, that they had had sexual relations several times on those days and that her child had been conceived sometime during that three day period. The plaintiff further testified that she had had no other sexual partners during the four months preceding and the four months succeeding this period.
The defendant testified that he did have sexual relations with the plaintiff in May, 1984, but stated that he had not been with the plaintiff at any time between July 3 and July 5, 1984. He also testified that he had not had sexual relations again with the plaintiff until after the baby was born. The defendant further testi*198fied that he had been either with Levine and her daughter or at his place of business between July 3 and July 5, 1984. Levine, with whom the defendant had lived from 1983 to 1984, also testified through deposition that the defendant had been with her and. her daughter on the days in question.
In addition to this testimony, the trial court also heard the testimony of Herbert Silver, the physician who supervised the blood testing procedure, who testified as an expert witness for the plaintiff regarding paternity testing, and Steven Reeders, a physician specializing in human genetics, who testified as an expert witness for the defendant regarding the unreliability of the paternity tests admitted into evidence. The trial court concluded after hearing all the evidence that Ã¢ÂÂthe evidence and testimony of the plaintiff [was] more believable than that of the defendant.Ã¢ÂÂ
The defendant contends on appeal that the trial court improperly found the plaintiff to be more credible than him. The defendant recounts at length every detail of the plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs testimony that would point to her lack of credibility and suggests that the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs expert witness was more credible because he was a disinterested party. In effect, the defendant claims that, when faced with inconsistent testimony, the trial court improperly chose the testimony of one side over that of the other.
Ã¢ÂÂWhere there is conflicting evidence, as claimed by the [defendant], we do not retry the facts or pass upon the credibility of the witnesses.Ã¢ÂÂ (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Emhart Industries, Inc. v. Amalgamated Local Union 376, U.A.W., 190 Conn. 371, 404, 461 A.2d 422 (1983). Ã¢ÂÂThe trier of the facts determines with finality the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be accorded their testimony.Ã¢ÂÂ (Internal quotation marks omitted.) State v. Robinson, 213 Conn. *199243, 256, 567 A.2d 1173 (1989); see Faiola v. Faiola, 156 Conn. 12, 15, 238 A.2d 405 (1968). The trial court heard the testimony of all of the witnesses and rendered its judgment accordingly. We will not usurp the fact-finding function of the trial court and retry the case on appeal as the defendant would have us do.
Moreover, we reject the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs contention that the court improperly ignored LevineÃ¢ÂÂs testimony, which corroborated the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs testimony that he was with Levine, not the plaintiff, between July 3 and July 5. The trial court stated in its memorandum of decision, Ã¢ÂÂ[tjaking into consideration all the evidence, exhibits and facts found, the court finds the defendant guilty as alleged in the complaint.Ã¢ÂÂ (Emphasis added.) The defendant provides no basis for asserting that the trial court purposefully ignored any of the evidence presented at trial. We conclude that when the trial court stated that it considered all the evidence before it, it did precisely that. These arguments of the defendant, therefore, also fail.
Ill
The defendant next argues that the trial court improperly awarded the plaintiff attorneyÃ¢ÂÂs fees because there was insufficient evidence to support the award. During the trial on financial issues, the plaintiff submitted a sworn affidavit indicating that she owed counsel $20,000 at the time of trial and attached a supporting itemization.6 The defendant argued that the *200plaintiff was barred from seeking attorneyÃ¢ÂÂs fees because she had failed to produce expert testimony that the fees were reasonable. In its memorandum of decision on financial issues, the trial court awarded the plaintiff $7000 in attorneyÃ¢ÂÂs fees. The court stated that Ã¢ÂÂ[t]he court on its own has a general knowledge of what would be a reasonable fee under the facts, circumstances and workload of this case. It finds this amount to be fair and reasonable.Ã¢ÂÂ
The defendant claims that the trial court improperly awarded attorneyÃ¢ÂÂs fees without conducting a hearing to consider evidence from an expert witness with respect to the reasonableness of the hours and monetary amount of the fees requested. The defendant does not claim that he was not permitted to introduce evidence regarding the unreasonableness of the fees requested, but that the plaintiff failed to produce evidence, through an expert witness, of their reasonableness. The defendant argues, therefore, that without a proper evidentiary foundation, an award of attorneyÃ¢ÂÂs fees could not be made. We disagree.
General Statutes ÃÂ§ 46b-171 governs permissible financial orders in a paternity action and provides that the court Ã¢ÂÂshall grant execution for . . . costs of suit taxed as in other civil actions, together with a reasonable attorneyÃ¢ÂÂs fee . . . .Ã¢ÂÂ The defendant claims that there must be a full evidentiary showing when attorneyÃ¢ÂÂs fees are sought under ÃÂ§ 46b-171, similar to that required under General Statutes ÃÂ§ 46b-62, which governs attorneyÃ¢ÂÂs fees in divorce proceedings.7
*201We decline to read such an evidentiary requirement into ÃÂ§ 46b-171 which, unlike ÃÂ§ 46b-62, does not expressly state that the trial court must consider the respective financial abilities of the parties or any other statutory criteria in awarding attorneyÃ¢ÂÂs fees. Moreover, even ÃÂ§ 46b-62 does not require expert evidence regarding the reasonableness of attorneyÃ¢ÂÂs fees. The trial court may exercise its discretion in determining the amount of fees allowable; Donato v. Corrado, 22 Conn. App. 583, 585-86, 578 A.2d 161 (1990); and the plaintiff need not introduce expert testimony to prove the reasonableness of the fee request.
Ã¢ÂÂCourts have a general knowledge of what would be a reasonable attorneyÃ¢ÂÂs fee for services which are fairly stated and described.Ã¢ÂÂ Appliances, Inc. v. Yost, 186 Conn. 673, 680, 443 A.2d 486 (1982). Ã¢ÂÂ[CJourts may rely on their general knowledge of what has occurred at the proceedings before them to supply evidence in support of an award of attorneyÃ¢ÂÂs fees. . . . The court [is] in a position to evaluate the complexity of the issues presented and the skill with which counsel had dealt with these issues.Ã¢ÂÂ Bizzoco v. Chinitz, 193 Conn. 304, 310-11, 476 A.2d 572 (1984). The trial court properly relied on the financial affidavit before it and on its general knowledge and involvement with the entire trial to ascertain a reasonable attorneyÃ¢ÂÂs fee. The defendantÃ¢ÂÂs argument is without merit.
*202IV
The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly determined his liability for past child support. The defendant first argues that the trial court improperly retroactively applied General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) ÃÂ§ 46b-160, as amended by No. 89-360, ÃÂ§ 44, of the 1989 Public Acts,8 to award the plaintiff child support from the date of the childÃ¢ÂÂs birth. The defendant also argues that the trial court failed to take into account the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs lengthy period of unemployment in determining the child support arrearage. We disagree with both of these claims.
At trial on the financial issues, the defendant testified that he had been unemployed for approximately four years, from 1987 to 1990. The defendantÃ¢ÂÂs sworn financial affidavit, however, reflected that he had earned $208,000 in 1986, and the defendant testified that in 1991 he was again employed and was earning $150,000 a year with the possibility of bonuses. Also, during his period of unemployment, the defendant testified that he had earned income as a self-employed consultant amounting to approximately $130,000. The trial court ordered the defendant to pay a child support arrearage of $99,600, finding that the defendant owed child support from April 21,1985, the day the child was born.
*203The defendant claims that the trial court improperly applied ÃÂ§ 46b-160, as amended by Public Act 89-360, to hold the defendant liable for past child support from the date of the childÃ¢ÂÂs birth rather than from three years preceding the granting of the paternity petition. At the time the paternity action was commenced, ÃÂ§ 46b-160 held the putative father liable for past child support Ã¢ÂÂlimited to the three years next preceding the granting of any such petition.Ã¢ÂÂ (Emphasis added.) General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) ÃÂ§ 46b-160, as amended by Public Acts 1985, No. 85-548, ÃÂ§ 3. In 1989, however, this provision was amended by Public Act 89-360 to hold the putative father liable for past child support Ã¢ÂÂlimited to the three years next preceding the date of the filing of any such petition.Ã¢ÂÂ (Emphasis added.) The defendant contends that holding him liable for an additional two and one-half years of past child support affects his substantive rights, and that the amended ÃÂ§ 46b-160 cannot therefore be retroactively applied.
In Moore v. McNamara, supra, 22, we stated that Ã¢ÂÂ[i]t is a rule of construction that legislation is to be applied prospectively unless the legislature clearly expresses an intention to the contrary. The rule is rooted in the notion that it would be unfair to impose a substantive amendment that changes the grounds upon which an action may be maintained on parties who have already transacted or who are already committed to litigation. ... In civil cases, however, unless considerations of good sense and justice dictate otherwise, it is presumed that procedural statutes will be applied retrospectively. . . . Procedural statutes have been traditionally viewed as affecting remedies, not substantive rights, and therefore leave the preexisting scheme intact.Ã¢ÂÂ (Citations omitted.)
Public Act 89-360, ÃÂ§ 44 did not create the right of a mother to receive support for a child bom out of wedlock; it merely expanded the period of time for which *204such support could be received. The amendment to ÃÂ§ 46b-160, therefore, was not directed to the right itself, but to the remedy. This type of amendment is generally a distinctly procedural matter. See, e.g., Roberts v. Caton, 224 Conn. 483, 488, 619 A.2d 844 (1993); Jones Destruction, Inc. v. Upjohn, 161 Conn. 191, 196, 286 A.2d 308 (1971); Lavieri v. Ulysses, 149 Conn. 396, 401, 180 A.2d 632 (1962).
Ã¢ÂÂThe rule that statutes which are general in their terms and affect matters of procedure can be applied retroactively, however, does not include a statute which, though in form providing but a change in remedy, actually brings about changes in substantive rights.Ã¢ÂÂ American MasonsÃ¢ÂÂ Supply Co. v. F.W. Brown Co., 174 Conn. 219, 223, 384 A.2d 378 (1978). The defendant argues that the expansion of the period of time for which he is liable for past child support, thus increasing his monetary liability, affects his substantive rights. Such an argument, however, would require this court to recognize a right to a monetary cap on liability. This we will not do.
We have held that, unless considerations of good sense and justice dictate otherwise, provisions affecting the period of limitation on liability may be retroactively applied. See Moore v. McNamara, supra, 22-25 (amendment to General Statutes ÃÂ§ 46b-160 expanding limitations period for right to bring paternity action from three to eighteen years applied retroactively); see also Jones Destruction, Inc. v. Upjohn, supra, 195-96. Section 46b-160 as amended does not express an intent contrary to retroactive application, and we are unpersuaded that its retroactive application would work an injustice on the defendant. We conclude that ÃÂ§ 46b-160 as amended may be applied retroactively and that the trial court properly awarded the plaintiff past child support from the time of the childÃ¢ÂÂs birth.
*205The defendant also argues that the trial court improperly made an award for past child support without accounting for his period of unemployment. The defendant suggests that the trial court could not have made a similar award had he been unemployed at the time of the trial, and that the support award should therefore have been reduced automatically because he had been unemployed for a period of time before the trial began.
General Statutes ÃÂ§ 46b-171 provides in part that Ã¢ÂÂ[i]f the defendant is found to be the father of the child, the court . . . shall order him to stand charged with the support and maintenance of such child . . . to be reasonably commensurate with the financial ability of the defendant .... Any order for the payment of support for any such child may at any time thereafter be set aside, altered or modified by any court issuing such order upon a showing of a substantial change in the circumstances of the defendant or the mother of such child . . . Once the defendant is found to be the father of the child, the order setting the amount and duration of the support of the child is a matter within the sound discretion of the trial court. This order will not be disturbed on appeal unless the trial court abused its discretion. Turner v. Richardson, 147 Conn. 423, 426, 162 A.2d 177 (1960); Hellman v. Karp, 93 Conn. 317, 324, 105 A. 678 (1919).
The trial court heard evidence of the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs financial ability, including evidence of: (1) the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs period of unemployment; (2) the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs income for the years both prior and subsequent to the period of unemployment; and (3) other income received by the defendant during the period of unemployment. The defendant has not pointed to any evidence that establishes an abuse of discretion. We conclude that the trial court properly determined the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs liability for past child support.
*206y
The defendantÃ¢ÂÂs final claim is that the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs amended memorandum of decision on financial issues improperly imposed new obligations on him. The defendant argues that several of the relief provisions in the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs amended decision were not included in the original memorandum and are more favorable to the plaintiff, thereby imposing new substantive obligations on the defendant. We disagree.
The following facts are relevant to this claim. After a trial on financial matters, the trial court issued a memorandum of decision that held the defendant liable for: (1) $300 per week child support to be paid on a biweekly basis; (2) one half of the childÃ¢ÂÂs unreimbursed medical and dental expenses to date; (3) a child support arrearage of $99,600; (4) one half of the premiums for medical and dental insurance for the child; and (5) $7000 in attorneyÃ¢ÂÂs fees.
Paragraph four of the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs original memorandum provided as follows: Ã¢ÂÂIn accordance with the provisions of General Statutes ÃÂ§ 46b-171, the plaintiff is ordered Ã¢ÂÂto become bound with sufficient surety to perform such orders for support and maintenance.Ã¢ÂÂ Thus, the plaintiff is ordered to execute a mortgage on [the] defendantÃ¢ÂÂs home to secure payment of the arrearage owed to her for almost 6-1/2 years worth of child support. It is further ordered that said minor be [the] irrevocable beneficiary on sufficient life insurance to secure the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs current child support obligation until the childÃ¢ÂÂs eighteenth birthday. The arrearage amount to be not less than for the total number of weeks from April 21,1985 to the date hereof. Total due $99,600.00.Ã¢ÂÂ (Emphasis added.)
The plaintiff subsequently filed a motion to correct and clarify, which asked the trial court to correct the *207obvious error ordering the plaintiff to provide sufficient surety to perform the support awards, and also requested articulation of the award of past child support secured by a mortgage to be executed by the defendant. Specifically, the plaintiff sought articulation as to whether the obligation for past child support would be due on demand or pursuant to a schedule of payments that included interest.
The trial court then issued an amended memorandum of decision on financial issues to clarify the provisions of paragraph four. The amended memorandum rectified the error as to which party was bound to provide surety for the support orders and noted that the $300 per week child support would continue until the childÃ¢ÂÂs eighteenth birthday. The amended memorandum further stated: Ã¢ÂÂThe court finds there is due and owing to the plaintiff an arrearage for support of said child from April 21, 1985 to date hereof the sum of $99,600.00. The court orders the defendant to pay the said amount plus interest at the rate of 5% per annum, when due, by executing a promissory note payable to the plaintiff secured by a mortgage on [the] defendantÃ¢ÂÂs home located at 25 Lords Highway, Weston, Connecticut. Said amount shall be paid as follows: $3,500.00 plus interest from date September 18, 1991 and a like sum plus interest each six months thereafter until fully paid. The defendant shall have the right to pay the entire balance amount together with interest due at any time and said mortgage shall contain the usual commercial mortgage clauses including payment of reasonable attorney fees to the plaintiff in the event of default in the payment hereof in accordance with its tenor.Ã¢ÂÂ
The defendant contends that the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs amended memorandum of decision was improper because it substantially changed the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs obligations and because neither party was given an opportunity for oral argument. The defendant claims that the trial court *208entered new orders because it: (1) provided that child support would continue until the childÃ¢ÂÂs eighteenth birthday; (2) required the defendant to execute a promissory note secured by a mortgage on his home; (3) required a payment of $3500 plus interest every six months for arrearages; and (4) released the defendant from the obligation of naming the child as an irrevocable beneficiary on the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs life insurance. The defendant argues that these amended orders are more favorable to the plaintiff and that they fail to maintain the relative positions of the parties after the original order.
Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂAn articulation is appropriate where the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs decision contains some ambiguity or deficiency reasonably susceptible of clarification.Ã¢ÂÂ State v. Wilson, 199 Conn. 417, 435, 513 A.2d 620 (1986); Rostain v. Rostain, 213 Conn. 686, 694-95, 569 A.2d 1126 (1990).Ã¢ÂÂ Carothers v. Capozziello, 215 Conn. 82, 114, 574 A.2d 1268 (1990). Ã¢ÂÂ[P]roper utilization of the motion for articulation serves to dispel any . . . ambiguity by clarifying the factual and legal basis upon which the trial court rendered its decision, thereby sharpening the issues on appeal.Ã¢ÂÂ Barnes v. Barnes, 190 Conn. 491, 494, 460 A.2d 1302 (1983). An articulation, however, Ã¢ÂÂis not an opportunity for a trial court to substitute a new decision [or] to change the reasoning or basis of a prior decision.Ã¢ÂÂ Koper v. Koper, 17 Conn. App. 480, 484, 553 A.2d 1162 (1989); see Eichman v. J & J Building Co., 216 Conn. 443, 458, 582 A.2d 182 (1990).
Under the authority of ÃÂ§ 46b-171, the court has broad discretion to craft an order to assure proper provisions for the support of the child. Turner v. Richardson, supra, 426. A comparison of the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs two memoranda of decision on financial issues persuades us that the trial court did not impose new substantive obligations on the defendant but rather clarified the method by which the original obligations would be met. Such *209clarification is proper on a motion for articulation. We conclude that the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs amended memorandum of decision on financial issues did not improperly substitute a new decision or change the substantive provisions of the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs original order. The defendantÃ¢ÂÂs final claim, therefore, is also without merit.
VI
The plaintiff claims in her appeal that the trial court improperly denied her corrected motion for an allowance to defend the appeal. In our view, the plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs primary challenge to the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs ruling was resolved by the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs response to her motion for articulation of the ruling, which was rendered while this appeal was pending.9 We therefore address the plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs claim only to the extent that it challenges the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs deferral of the issue of determining attorneyÃ¢ÂÂs fees for defending the appeal until after the appeal is concluded.10
*210Section 46b-171 provides in pertinent part that the trial court may order the defendant in a paternity action to stand charged with Ã¢ÂÂcosts of suit taxed as in other civil actions, together with a reasonable attorneyÃ¢ÂÂs fee. . . .Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂAlthough the express language of the statute does not distinguish attorneyÃ¢ÂÂs fees for trial from those for an appeal, it does authorize the trial court to charge the defendant with the attorneyÃ¢ÂÂs fees affiliated with the Ã¢ÂÂsuit.Ã¢ÂÂ We conclude that the term Ã¢ÂÂsuitÃ¢ÂÂ in the statute encompasses the fees for both the trial and the appeal. See, e.g., Crowther v. Gerber Garment Technology, Inc., 8 Conn. App. 254, 271-72, 513 A.2d 144 (1986) (reasonable attorneyÃ¢ÂÂs fees allowed in a Ã¢ÂÂcivil actionÃ¢ÂÂ included attorneyÃ¢ÂÂs fees incurred at the appellate level); Conservation Commission v. Price, 5 Conn. App. 70, 74, 496 A.2d 982 (1985) (use of the term Ã¢ÂÂactionÃ¢ÂÂ in General Statutes ÃÂ§ 22a-44 construed to allow attorneyÃ¢ÂÂs fees incurred both at trial and appeal).
In dissolution of marriage proceedings, we have held that the trial court may exercise its discretion to award attorneyÃ¢ÂÂs fees to defend an appeal. Blake v. Blake, 211 Conn. 485, 488-89, 560 A.2d 396 (1989); Darak v. Darak, 210 Conn. 462, 477, 556 A.2d 145 (1989). We have stated that this discretion of the trial court ensures Ã¢ÂÂthat a lack of funds does not deprive one party of his or her rights.Ã¢ÂÂ Darak v. Darak, supra. We see no reason why the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs authority to award attorneyÃ¢ÂÂs fees in a paternity action should not also encompass authority to award fees to defend an appeal. We conclude, moreover, that ÃÂ§ 46b-171 grants the trial court broad discretion not only in determining the amount of fees allowed; Donato v. Corrado, 22 Conn. App. 583, *211585-86, 578 A.2d 161 (1990); but also in determining when an award of attorneyÃ¢ÂÂs fees will be made. We do not consider the decision of the trial court to defer the determination of an award of attorneyÃ¢ÂÂs fees for the appeal until after the proceedings are concluded to be an abuse of the courtÃ¢ÂÂs discretion.
We affirm the judgment and remand the case to the trial court for a determination of an award of attorneyÃ¢ÂÂs fees to the plaintiff for the appeal.
In this opinion the other justices concurred.

 The plaintiff filed a first motion for an allowance to defend the appeal on November 4,1991, which the trial court denied without prejudice, citing to two cases that indicated the trial court believed the motion to have been filed prematurely. The plaintiff then filed a corrected motion for an allowance to defend the appeal on November 14,1991, which was denied with prejudice, and from which the plaintiff appeals. See footnote 9.


 At the time the defendant moved for the blood test, General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) ÃÂ§ 46b-168 provided in relevant part: Ã¢ÂÂIn any proceeding in which a question of paternity is an issue, the court, on motion of any party, may order the mother, her child and the putative father or the husband of the mother to submit to one or more blood grouping tests, to be made by a qualified physician or other qualified person, designated by the court, to determine whether or not the putative father or the husband of the mother can be excluded as being the father of the child. The results of such tests shall be admissible in evidence only in cases where such results establish definite exclusion of the putative father or such husband as such father.Ã¢ÂÂ


 With respect to its finding of paternity, the trial court specifically found, inter alia, that: (1) the plaintiff and the defendant had a professional working relationship that had become intimate; (2) sexual relations had commenced during the month of May, 1984, and had continued throughout the dates of July 8, 4 and 5, 1984, around which time the plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs child was conceived; (3) the plaintiff did not have any sexual relations with other men during the relevant time period; (4) the plaintiff consistently claimed that the defendant was the father of her child; (5) the defendant offered to pay for an abortion when the plaintiff informed him of the pregnancy; (6) the defendant told the plaintiff that the child would be cared for and would be included in his will; and (7) the child resembled the defendant.


 General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) ÃÂ§ 46b-168 provides as follows: Ã¢ÂÂblood TESTS WHEN PATERNITY IS IN DISPUTE. ASSESSMENT OF COSTS, (a) In any proceeding in which a question of paternity is an issue, the court or a family support magistrate, on motion of any party, may order the mother, her child and the putative father or the husband of the mother to submit to one or more blood grouping tests, to be made by a qualified physician or other qualified person, designated by the court, to determine whether or not the putative father or the husband of the mother can be excluded as being the father of the child. The results of such tests shall be admissible in evidence only in cases where such results establish definite exclusion of the putative father or such husband as such father.
Ã¢ÂÂ(b) At any proceeding in which the question of paternity is at issue the court or a family support magistrate, on motion of any party, may order genetic tests which shall mean human leukocyte antigen tests or DNA tests, to be performed unless a putative father or husband has been excluded by prior blood grouping tests. Such tests shall be made by a hospital, accredited laboratory, qualified physician or other qualified person designated by the court, to determine whether or not the putative father or husband is the father of the child. The results of such tests shall be admissible in evidence to either establish definite exclusion of the putative father or husband or as evidence that he is the father of the child.
Ã¢ÂÂ(c) The costs of making tests provided by this section shall be chargeable against the party making the motion, provided if the court finds that such party is indigent and unable to pay such costs, such costs shall be paid by the state. If the costs of making such tests are paid by the state and *194the respondent making the motion is subsequently adjudicated to be the father of the child, such respondent shall be liable to the state for the amount of such costs.Ã¢ÂÂ


 Because of our disposition of this claim, we do not decide whether No. 89-360 of the 1989 Public Acts may be applied retroactively.


 The plaintiff was entitled to seek attorneyÃ¢ÂÂs fees from the defendant by virtue of General Statutes ÃÂ§ 46b-171, which provides in relevant part: Ã¢ÂÂIf the defendant is found to be the father of the child, the court or family support magistrate shall order him to stand charged with the support and maintenance of such child, with the assistance of the mother if she is financially able . . . to be reasonably commensurate with the financial ability of the defendant, and to pay a certain sum periodically until the child attains the age of eighteen years; and the court or family support magistrate shall order him to pay the amount thereof to the complainant . . . and shall *200grant execution for the same and costs of suit taxed as in other civil actions, together with a reasonable attorneyÃ¢ÂÂs fee; and may require him to become bound with sufficient surety to performsuch orders for support and maintenance. ...Ã¢ÂÂ


 Under General Statutes ÃÂ§ 46b-62, the trial court may order Ã¢ÂÂeither parent to pay the reasonable attorneyÃ¢ÂÂs fees of the other in accordance with their respective financial abilities and the criteria set forth in section 46b-82.Ã¢ÂÂ
General Statutes ÃÂ§ 46b-82 provides in relevant part: Ã¢ÂÂIn determining whether alimony shall be awarded, and the duration and amount of the *201award, the court shall hear the witnesses, if any, of each party, except as provided in subsection (a) of section 46b-51, shall consider the length of the marriage, the causes for the annulment, dissolution of the marriage or legal separation, the age, health, station, occupation, amount and sources of income, vocational skills, employability, estate and needs of each of the parties and the award, if any, which the court may make pursuant to section 46b-81, and, in the case of a parent to whom the custody of minor children has been awarded, the desirability of such parentÃ¢ÂÂs securing employment.Ã¢ÂÂ
This court has held that, in a divorce proceeding, an award of attorneyÃ¢ÂÂs fees should not be made until after a trial court has heard evidence relating to the financial resources of the parties in light of the statutory criteria. Arrigoni v. Arrigoni, 184 Conn. 513, 519, 440 A.2d 206 (1981).


 General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) ÃÂ§ 46b-160, as amended by Public Acts 1989, No. 89-360, ÃÂ§ 44, provides in relevant part: Ã¢ÂÂ(a) Proceedings to establish paternity of a child bom or conceived out of lawful wedlock, including one bom to, or conceived by, a married woman but begotten by a man other than her husband, shall be instituted by a verified petition of the mother or expectant mother, with summons and order, filed in the superior court for the judicial district in which either she or the putative father resides .... Such petition may be brought at any time prior to the childÃ¢ÂÂs eighteenth birthday, provided liability for past support shall be limited to the three years next preceding the date of the filing of any such petition. . . .Ã¢ÂÂ


 The plaintiffs motion for an allowance to defend the appeal was dated February 21, 1990, and filed on November 4, 1991. Noting a mistake in the date on the motion, the plaintiff filed a corrected motion for an allowance to defend the appeal on November 14, 1991.
The trial court ruled on both motions on November 29, 1991. It denied the first motion without prejudice, citing as the basis for its ruling Conservation Commission v. Price, 5 Conn. App. 70, 496 A.2d 982 (1985), and Crowther v. Gerber Garment Technology, Inc., 8 Conn. App. 254, 513 A.2d 144 (1986). These cases indicated that the trial court had denied the plaintiffs motion because it believed it was premature, and that attorneyÃ¢ÂÂs fees should be determined after the appeal was concluded. The trial court then denied the plaintiffs corrected motion with prejudice, citing to the same cases. Because of the inconsistency of these rulings, the plaintiff sought an articulation, asking which decision should apply. The trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs articulation was rendered while this appeal was pending, and indicated that the court had considered its denial without prejudice of the plaintiffs first motion controlling and that it had intended to defer the issue of attorneyÃ¢ÂÂs fees until after the appeal was concluded. It is clear, therefore, that the trial court did not deny the plaintiff the opportunity to receive attorneyÃ¢ÂÂs fees for the appeal altogether, but rather that it chose to defer the issue.


 The defendant claims that the plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs claim is essentially one of timing, and that the plaintiff challenges the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs decision not to award *210attorneyÃ¢ÂÂs fees for the appeal until after the appeal. The defendant argues that this claim is moot because the appellate process will terminate at the same time this court decides the issue and therefore we cannot offer the plaintiff any practical relief. A plaintiffs right to attorneyÃ¢ÂÂs fees before rather than after the prosecution of an appeal presents, however, a question of law that is justiciable.

Norcott, J.
The sole issue in this appeal is whether the initiation of a federal forfeiture proceeding pursuant to 21 U.S.C. ÃÂ§ 881 requires a stay of concurrent state foreclosure proceedings pursuant to General Statutes ÃÂ§ 12-181. The plaintiff, the city of Hartford, initiated an action in the trial court to foreclose municipal tax liens on property owned by the named defendant, Stanley Tucker. The named defendant appealed the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs judgment of foreclosure by sale to the Appellate Court, which affirmed the judgment of the trial court. Hartford v. Tucker, 27 Conn. App. 912, 606 A.2d 62 (1992). We granted the named defendantÃ¢ÂÂs petition for certification limited to the following issue: Ã¢ÂÂDoes the initiation of federal forfeiture proceedings *213stay concurrent foreclosure proceedings pending in the stateÃ¢ÂÂs courts?Ã¢ÂÂ Hartford v. Tucker, 223 Conn. 909, 612 A.2d 55 (1992). We conclude that it does not.
The relevant facts are undisputed. The plaintiff commenced an action to foreclose municipal tax liens on property owned by the named defendant in February, 1983. After a second trial,1 the trial court rendered a judgment of foreclosure by sale. The named defendant appealed to the Appellate Court, which affirmed the judgment of foreclosure by sale and remanded the case to the trial court to reset the foreclosure sale date. Hartford v. Tucker, supra, 27 Conn. App. 912.
While the named defendantÃ¢ÂÂs appeal of the judgment of foreclosure by sale was pending in the Appellate Court, the federal government filed an action against his property pursuant to 21 U.S.C. ÃÂ§ 881, the forfeiture provision of the Controlled Substances Act. This statute provides that all property that is used or intended to be used to facilitate a violation of the actÃ¢ÂÂs provisions is subject to forfeiture to the United States. The complaint filed by the federal government in August, 1991, alleged that, beginning in March, 1989, controlled substances were sold on the named defendantÃ¢ÂÂs property. The property was seized by a United States marshall in August of 1991.
Shortly after the Appellate CourtÃ¢ÂÂs decision had been rendered, the named defendant filed a motion for rehearing in the Appellate Court. That motion asserted, for the first time, that sovereign immunity and interests of comity required that the state foreclosure action *214be stayed because the same res was at issue in both the state and federal actions. This motion was denied. The named defendant then petitioned this court for certification, which we granted limited to consideration of whether the initiation of a federal forfeiture proceeding automatically stayed concurrent foreclosure proceedings pending in the stateÃ¢ÂÂs courts.
The named defendant claims that ÃÂ§ 881 (c)2 gives exclusive jurisdiction to the federal courts over property subject to forfeiture while forfeiture actions are pending.3 Thus, he argues, any concurrent state actions must automatically be stayed pending the outcome of the federal forfeiture action. We disagree.
This is an issue of first impression in Connecticut. An analogous situation, however, was recently addressed by the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in In re Newport Savings & Loan Assn., 928 F.2d 472 (1st Cir. 1991), where a bank, holding mortgages on property seized by the federal government under ÃÂ§ 881, sought to initiate a foreclosure *215proceeding in the state court on the same property. The court held that ÃÂ§ 881 (d) provides the necessary guidance when there are multiple claims to the same property. That provision states that Ã¢ÂÂ[t]he provisions of law relating to the seizure, summary and judicial forfeiture, and condemnation of property for violation of the customs laws . . . shall apply to seizures and forfeitures [under this statute] . . . insofar as applicable and not inconsistent with the provisions hereof. . . .Ã¢ÂÂ (Emphasis added.) 21 U.S.C. ÃÂ§ 881 (d). The court further explained that the customs laws permitted the release of seized property upon the posting of a proper bond. In re Newport Savings & Loan Assn., supra, 479. Customs laws, therefore, contemplate the exercise of concurrent jurisdiction over the same res so long as proper security is offered through the posting of a bond to protect the governmentÃ¢ÂÂs interests.
We agree with the reasoning of the court in In re Newport Savings & Loan Assn., supra, that the enactment of ÃÂ§ 881 (d) counsels against reading the forfeiture statute to provide for exclusive jurisdiction. We note, moreover, that 21 U.S.C. ÃÂ§ 903,4 the anti-preemption provision of the Controlled Substances Act, evidences the fact that Congress specifically considered the issue of concurrent state proceedings and decided to allow them. See United States v. $79,123.49 In United States Cash & Currency, 830 F.2d 94 (7th Cir. 1987) (concurrent state and federal forfeiture actions held to be permissible due to the antipreemption provision).5 *216Furthermore, ÃÂ§ 881 is Ã¢ÂÂunlike bankruptcy,6 [in that] no [provision] seems to say that anyone needs a federal courtÃ¢ÂÂs approval in order to bring a state-law foreclosure action.Ã¢ÂÂ In re Newport Savings & Loan Assn., supra, 474.
In the absence of unambiguous statutory language supporting a stay or evidence that Congress clearly intended that the federal government have exclusive jurisdiction, we hold that 21 U.S.C. ÃÂ§ 881 does not bar concurrent state court jurisdiction. We conclude, therefore, that the initiation of federal forfeiture proceedings under ÃÂ§ 881 does not require a stay of concurrent state foreclosure proceedings.
Our conclusion, however, is not determinative of whether a discretionary stay might be appropriate in this sort of proceeding. We note that Ã¢ÂÂas a practical matter, it may be impossible to find a buyer at a foreclosure sale for property that is Ã¢ÂÂin the custody of the Attorney General,Ã¢ÂÂ 21 U.S.C. ÃÂ§ 881 (c), and to which the United States asserts a legal claim.Ã¢ÂÂ In re Newport Savings & Loan Assn., supra. It undoubtedly *217would be within the power of the trial court, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, to stay further proceedings pending the outcome of the forfeiture action. See First National Bank & Trust Co. v. McCoy, 124 Conn. 111, 116, 198 A. 183 (1938); Sauter v. Sauter, 4 Conn. App. 581, 584-85, 495 A.2d 1116 (1985). On remand to the trial court to set the foreclosure sale date, therefore, the trial court should consider whether a discretionary stay would be warranted.
The judgment of the Appellate Court is affirmed.
In this opinion the other justices concurred.

 On March 11,1985, the trial court, Shaughnessy, J. rendered judgment of strict foreclosure from which the named defendant appealed. The Appellate Court concluded that the trial court had miscalculated the amount of the tax arrearage and remanded the case for a new trial. Hartford v. Tucker, 8 Conn. App. 209, 215, 512 A.2d 944 (1986). It is from the Appellate CourtÃ¢ÂÂs affirmance of the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs judgment on the second trial that the named defendant appeals pursuant to our grant of certification.


 Section 881 (c) of title 21 of the United States Code provides in relevant part: Ã¢ÂÂProperty taken or detained under this section shall not be repleviable, but shall be deemed to be in the custody of the Attorney General, subject only to the orders and decrees of the court or the official having jurisdiction thereof.Ã¢ÂÂ


 The named defendant also claims that the taxes assessed on the 1988-91 tax lists were invalid due to 21 U.S.C. ÃÂ§ 881 (h), which states that Ã¢ÂÂ[a]ll right, title, and interest in property described in subsection (a) of this section shall vest in the United States upon commission of the act giving rise to forfeiture under this section.Ã¢ÂÂ In this case, therefore, title to the named defendantÃ¢ÂÂs property would have vested in the United States on March 2, 1989, the date of the first alleged infraction, rather than on August 26, 1991, the date of the seizure. He claims that because the city of Hartford has no right to tax the federal government, all taxes relating back to the date of the original violation are void: The plaintiff concedes this point. But see United States v. A Parcel of Land, Buildings, Appurtenances & Improvements, Known as 92 Buena Vista Avenue, Rumson, New Jersey, 507 U.S. , 113 S. Ct. 1126, 1134-35, 122 L. Ed. 2d 469 (1993) (relation back doctrine of ÃÂ§ 881 [h] does not vest title in the federal government until it has obtained a judgment of forfeiture). We do not address this claim, however, as it is not relevant to the certified issue.


 21 U.S.C. ÃÂ§ 903 provides as follows: Ã¢ÂÂNo provision of this subchapter shall be construed as indicating an intent on that part of the Congress to occupy the field in which that provision operates, including criminal penalties, to the exclusion of any State law on the same subject matter which would otherwise be within the authority of the State, unless there is a positive conflict between that provision of this subchapter and that State law so that the two cannot consistently stand together.Ã¢ÂÂ


 The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit further stated that 21 U.S.C. ÃÂ§ 881 (c) Ã¢ÂÂhardly establishes that the state court lacked *216jurisdiction . . . since the court was proceeding under a valid [state] forfeiture statute.Ã¢ÂÂ United States v. $79,123.49 in United States Cash & Currency, 830 F.2d 94, 98 (7th Cir. 1987). That court, therefore, found the state and federal forfeiture statutes to be sufficiently disparate so that there was not a positive conflict ... so that the two could not consistently stand together. 21 U.S.C. ÃÂ§ 903. State foreclosure proceedings and federal forfeiture actions are even more dissimilar, and therefore even less likely to produce the conflict contemplated by 21 U.S.C. ÃÂ§ 903.


 The federal bankruptcy statute, 11 U.S.C. ÃÂ§ 362, provides in pertinent part: Ã¢ÂÂ(a) Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, a petition filed under section 301,302, or 303 of this title, or an application filed under section 5 (a) (3) of the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970 (15 U.S.C. 78eee (a) (3)), operates as a stay, applicable to all entities, ofÃ¢ÂÂ
Ã¢ÂÂ(1) the commencement or continuation, including the issuance or employment of process, of a judicial, administrative, or other action or proceeding against the debtor that was or could have been commenced before the commencement of the ease under this title, or to recover a claim against the debtor that arose before the commencement of the case under this title. . . .Ã¢ÂÂ

Berdon, J.
The principal issue in this case is whether the trial court was correct in granting summary judgment to the defendant town of Stonington on the ground that the plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs action is based on negligence rather than the municipal highway defect statute.1
This action arises out of an accident that occurred on August 12, 1988. The plaintiff, David Steele, was operating a motorcycle on a road that the defendant had a duty to maintain. His complaint alleged that he sustained serious injuries after a pothole caused him to lose control of his motorcycle and crash into a stone wall. The plaintiff furnished the defendant with written notice of his intention to sue on November 3,1988. The notice stated that it was being given pursuant to General Statutes ÃÂ§ 7-465, the municipal employee indemnification statute.2
After the pleadings were closed, the defendant moved for summary judgment. The defendantÃ¢ÂÂs principal argu*219ment was that the municipal highway defect statute, General Statutes ÃÂ§ 13a-149,3 was the plaintiffs exclusive remedy, that the plaintiffs action was grounded in negligence rather than the statute, and that summary judgment was therefore appropriate. The trial court agreed with the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs argument and rendered summary judgment. The plaintiff moved to reargue4 and set aside the judgment; the motion was denied. The plaintiff then appealed the judgment to the Appellate Court. We transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book ÃÂ§ 4023 and General Statutes ÃÂ§ 51-199 (c). We reverse.
*220We agree with the trial court and the defendant that, pursuant to the Tort Reform Act of 1986,5 Ã¢ÂÂan action under the highway defect statute, ÃÂ§ 13a-149, is a plaintiffs exclusive remedy against a municipality or other political subdivision Ã¢ÂÂfor damages resulting from injury to any person or property by means of a defective road or bridge.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ Sanzone v. Board of Police Commissioners, 219 Conn. 179, 192, 592 A.2d 912 (1991). We disagree, however, with the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs argument that the plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs claim must be construed as a negligence claim rather than a claim pursuant to ÃÂ§ 13a-149.
The defendant argues that the plaintiffs claim should be construed as one based upon negligence rather than ÃÂ§ 13a-149 because the plaintiffs complaint contains specific allegations of negligence.6 Common law negligence principles are, however, Ã¢ÂÂa foundation for determining whether the defendant breached its duty under ÃÂ§ 13a-149.Ã¢ÂÂ Sullivan v. Norwalk, 28 Conn. App. 449, 457, 612 A.2d 114 (1992). Ã¢ÂÂ[E]ven though the plaintiffs cause of action is statutory, principles of negligence are instructive in analyzing the extent of the defendant's duty to the plaintiff.Ã¢ÂÂ Id.
Indeed, although the cause of action under ÃÂ§ 13a-149 is predicated upon a defective highway, we have long held that the municipalityÃ¢ÂÂs liability under the statute resembles liability for negligence. See, e.g., Bacon v. Rocky Hill, 126 Conn. 402, 404, 11 A.2d 399 (1940); Frechette v. New Haven, 104 Conn. 83, 87-90, 132 A. 467 (1926). If a difference does exist between an action predicated on the municipal highway defect statute and negligence, that difference, except for the requirement that the plaintiff act with due care, is paper thin. So, for example, we have held that to Ã¢ÂÂestablish liability [under ÃÂ§ 13a-149], the plaintiff ha[s] the burden of prov*221ing (1) the existence of a defect which resulted from the failure of the defendant to use reasonable care to keep the ... [highways] within its control in a reasonably safe condition for public travel; (2) notice, either actual or constructive, to the defendant of the defect; and (3) the exercise by him of due care.Ã¢ÂÂ Rodriguez v. New Haven, 183 Conn. 473, 476, 439 A.2d 421 (1981); see Burke v. West Hartford, 147 Conn. 149, 151, 157 A.2d 757 (1960), and cases cited therein; Frechette v. New Haven, supra, 87-88, and cases cited therein. The similarities between these requirements and the elements of negligence are so strong that it was not inappropriate for the plaintiff to allege negligence in stating a claim under ÃÂ§ 13a-149.
The defendant also argues that the plaintiffs claim should be construed as a negligence action rather than a ÃÂ§ 13a-149 suit because the complaint fails to cite ÃÂ§ 13a-149,7 and fails to allege due care on the plaintiffs part. The complaint, however, does allege that the defendant is a municipal corporation Ã¢ÂÂcharged with the proper care and maintenance of the streets and highwaysÃ¢ÂÂ; that on August 12,1988, the plaintiff had been operating a motorcycle on Flanders Road in Stoning-ton; that Ã¢ÂÂas the Plaintiff approached a curve in said road approximately 3/10 of a mile north of Deans Mill Road, the Plaintiff suddenly encountered a series of potholes and bumps in the road, causing him to lose control of his motorcycle and impact with a stone wall along the side of the roadÃ¢ÂÂ; that the defendant had actual or constructive notice of the potholes and bumps; *222that the plaintiffs accident was caused by specific acts of negligence; that he was injured and incurred damages as a result; and that he gave notice to the defendant and annexed a copy of the notice to the complaint.8 Surely, these allegations are sufficient to satisfy the first two requirements set forth in Rodriguez v. New Haven, supra.
The only prong of Rodriguez not covered by the complaint is that the plaintiff failed to plead due care affirmatively. The defendantÃ¢ÂÂs answer, however, alleged contributory negligence as a special defense, and the plaintiff denied this allegation in his reply. Thus, the pleadings do raise the plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs due care as an issue of fact, rendering summary judgment on the plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs ÃÂ§ 13a-149 claim inappropriate. See Practice Book ÃÂ§ 384.
Finally, the defendant points to the citation of the wrong statute in the plaintiffs notice as a reason to uphold the grant of summary judgment. As we have concluded today in the companion case of Pratt v. Old Saybrook, 225 Conn. 177, 621 A.2d 1322 (1993), the mere reference in the notice to ÃÂ§ 7-465 instead of ÃÂ§ 13a-149 did not invalidate the notice. Further, the improper citation to ÃÂ§ 7-465 in the notice (which is incorporated in the complaint) did not transform the plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs claim into an action predicated on negligence rather than on ÃÂ§ 13a-149.
Accordingly, we conclude that the allegations of the complaint were sufficient to state a cause of action *223under ÃÂ§ 13a-149, and that the plaintiff gave sufficient notice under that statute, despite his incorrect reference to ÃÂ§ 7-465.
The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings.
In this opinion the other justices concurred.

 Because of our disposition of this appeal, we need not address the plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs additional claim that the trial court erred in failing to follow the law of the case.


 General Statutes ÃÂ§ 7-465 makes municipalities liable for certain damages caused by their employees to third parties in the course of their duties as employees.


 General Statutes ÃÂ§ 13a-149 provides: Ã¢ÂÂAny person injured in person or property by means of a defective road or bridge may recover damages from the party bound to keep it in repair. ... No action for any such injury shall be maintained against any town, city, corporation or borough, unless written notice of such injury and a general description of the same, and of the cause thereof and of the time and place of its occurrence, shall, within ninety days thereafter be given to a selectman or the clerk of such town, or to the clerk of such city or borough .... No notice given under the provisions of this section shall be held invalid or insufficient by reason of an inaccuracy in describing the injury or in stating the time, place or cause of its occurrence, if it appears that there was no intention to mislead or that such town, city, corporation or borough was not in fact misled thereby.Ã¢ÂÂ


 We note that when the plaintiff moved to reargue the motion for summary judgment, the trial judge questioned whether he had the authority to entertain such a motion because there is no provision for such reargument in the Practice Book. Notwithstanding the absence of a rule or statute, it is the inherent authority of every court, as long as it retains jurisdiction, to reconsider a prior ruling. As the United States Supreme Court has said: Ã¢ÂÂIt is a power inherent in every court of justice so long as it retains control of the subject matter and of the parties, to correct that which has been wrongfully done by virtue of its process.Ã¢ÂÂ (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) United States v. Morgan, 307 U.S. 183, 197, 59 S. Ct. 795, 83 L. Ed. 1211 (1939); see Board of Education v. New Haven, 221 Conn. 214, 215, 602 A.2d 1018 (1992) (Ã¢ÂÂ[i]t is puzzling to us why, after the trial court rendered the judgment of dismissal, none of the parties ever sought to reargue the dismissal before the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂ). If a court is not convinced that its initial ruling is correct, then in the interests of justice it should reconsider the order, provided it retains jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties.

 It is clear that our general practice in this state is to require fact pleading only. Practice Book ÃÂ§ÃÂ§ 108 and 109. Practice Book ÃÂ§ 109A provides in part, however, that Ã¢ÂÂ[w]hen any claim made in a complaint, cross complaint, special defense, or other pleading is grounded on a statute, the statute shall be specifically identified by its number.Ã¢ÂÂ Although the plaintiff failed to cite General Statutes ÃÂ§ 13a-149 in his complaint as the basis for his action, we have held that ÃÂ§ 109A is merely directory and not mandatory. Rowe v. Godou, 209 Conn. 273, 275, 550 A.2d 1073 (1988).


 The plaintiff alleged more specifically in his complaint that the defendant was negligent in one or more of the following ways: Ã¢ÂÂ(a) The Defendant failed to fill or otherwise repair the potholes in the road surface; (b) [t]he Defendant failed to remove the bumps and level the road surface; (c) [t]he Defendant permitted said holes and bumps to remain on the highway for an unreasonable length of time; and (d) [t]he Defendant failed to erect any warning signs or otherwise failed to warn motorists of the condition existing on the highway in violation of Connecticut General Statutes Section 13a-120.Ã¢ÂÂ

Norcott, J.
The dispositive issue in this appeal is whether an individual claiming to be injured in a one car, force and rim accident1 must provide independent corroborative evidence of the accident in order to recover uninsured motorist benefits from his insurance carrier. The plaintiff, Keystone Insurance Company, moved in the trial court to vacate an arbitration award made to the defendant, Dean Raffile, because the defendant had not proved his claim of a force and run accident by corroborative evidence. The trial court vacated the arbitration award, concluding that our decision in Streitweiser v. Middlesex Mutual Assurance Co., 219 Conn. 371, 593 A.2d 498 (1991), required the defendant to provide corroborative evidence of his version of the accident and that the defendant had failed to satisfy that requirement. The defendant appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book ÃÂ§ 4023 and General Statutes ÃÂ§ 51-199 (c). We now reverse.
The following facts are relevant to this appeal. On September 3,1986, the defendant was severely injured in a one car accident in North Haven after his vehicle swerved off the road into a utility pole. The defendant lost consciousness after the impact and awoke in the emergency room of Yale-New Haven Hospital. The defendant was hospitalized until October 7,1986. During that time, he underwent seven operations to correct a fracture of the neck, and wore a halo brace bolted into his head for ten days to provide traction until sur*225gery could be performed. The testimony of the defendant and his wife, as well as hospital records, revealed that the defendant was in extreme pain and was severely distressed about his treatment, displaying volatile emotions, disorientation and lack of coherence and rationality. After his release from the hospital, the defendant went to Florida until March, 1987, to stay with his parents while he recuperated.
The defendantÃ¢ÂÂs wife, Lucille Raffile, did not discuss the details of the accident with the defendant while he was hospitalized because he did not appear to be coherent or rational. On the morning after the accident, she called the plaintiff to report the accident and stated that the defendant had fallen asleep behind the wheel and had hit a tree or a telephone pole.2 Ten days later she submitted a no-fault benefits application to the plaintiff and described the accident similarly.
On August 29, 1988, the defendant made an uninsured motorist claim against the plaintiff, claiming that an unknown vehicle that had entered the road in front of the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs vehicle had caused him to swerve and to strike the utility pole. The plaintiff contested this claim and the matter was ultimately submitted to arbitration. A panel of three arbitrators heard the case on divers days between December, 1989, and September, 1991. The principal issue was whether the defendant was entitled to coverage because of the absence of contact between the unidentified vehicle and the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs vehicle.3 Because this court was about to decide the requirement of contact in an uninsured *226motorist claim in Streitwieser v. Middlesex Mutual Assurance Co., supra, the arbitration panel postponed briefs and oral argument until that decision was issued.
The defendant testified to the arbitration panel that, during the third week after his second operation, he had recalled that he had been run off the road by a yellow station wagon that had pulled out of a private driveway in front of him.4 The defendant had relayed this information to his brother, Arthur Raffile, a North Haven policeman, the day after the accident.5 The defendantÃ¢ÂÂs brother testified that he had independently investigated the accident on the basis of what the defendant had told him. The investigating officers told the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs brother that no one had smelled liquor on the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs breath the night of the accident and that no motor vehicle citation had been issued to the defendant after the accident.6 The defendantÃ¢ÂÂs brother also testified that he had completed the motor vehicle accident report for the defendant, which reflected that an unidentified vehicle had been the cause of the accident.7
*227The defendantÃ¢ÂÂs wife testified at the arbitration hearing that during the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs hospitalization he had made references to headlights and a car, but that she had not taken the matter seriously. She also testified that she had not discussed the details of the accident with the defendant until he had returned from Florida in March, 1987, and that she had not reported this new information to the plaintiff because she thought the defendant had done so. An expert accident reconstructionist introduced by the defendant testified that, in light of the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs version of the accident, the police report and his own investigation, it was reasonable for the defendant to have failed to see the other vehicle and that the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs evasive action had been reasonable.
The police accident report noted that no skid marks were found in the area of the accident and that there were no witnesses to the accident. An expert for the plaintiff testified that the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs serum blood alcohol level, as taken from the hospital records, equated to approximately 0.15% to 0.24% of body weight. The defendant admitted to having consumed approximately one bottle of wine on the night of the accident between 6 p.m. and 12:30 a.m.
A majority of the arbitrators found for the defendant on the issue of liability8 and assessed his damages at $450,000. The majority of the panel also attributed 50 percent comparative negligence to the defendant and, accordingly, reduced his award by that percentage plus $16,600 for basic reparations benefits already paid. The net award to the defendant, therefore, totaled $208,400.9
*228The plaintiff subsequently applied to vacate the arbitratorsÃ¢ÂÂ award pursuant to General Statutes ÃÂ§ 52-41810 on the grounds that: (1) the award contravened public policy because the defendant had failed to prove his claim of a force and run accident by independent corroborative evidence; (2) the award was arbitrary and contrary to law because the majority of arbitrators either had failed to apply or had misapplied the corroboration requirement; and (3) the defendant had failed to meet the requirements of his insurance contract by failing to notify the police of the force and run driver. 11
*229The trial court granted the plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs application to vacate the award. The trial court reasoned that our decision in Streitweiser required the defendant to provide corroborative evidence of his version of the accident and that, because all the testimony presented emanated from the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs representations, the defendant had failed to provide such corroborative evidence.
The defendant contends on appeal that the trial court improperly interpreted our decision in Streitweiser to require a claimant to supply independent corroborative evidence that a force and run accident occurred in order to recover uninsured motorist benefits for injuries resulting from a force and run accident.12 The defendant argues that this court did not set a standard requiring corroborative evidence to prove force and run accidents in Streitweiser, and that a claimantÃ¢ÂÂs burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence provides sufficient assurance against the risk of fraudulent claims. We conclude that there is no legal requirement for independent corroborative evidence of claims involving force and run accidents.
In Streitweiser, we held that a physical contact requirement, if an unidentified vehicle causes the claimantÃ¢ÂÂs accident, is inconsistent with the public policy underlying statutorily mandated uninsured motorist *230coverage. Id., 381. In so deciding, we joined a host of other jurisdictions that had similarly reasoned that a physical contact requirement is Ã¢ÂÂan unjustifiable deviation from the legislative goals of uninsured motorist legislation.Ã¢ÂÂ13 Id. We did note in dictum, however, that the concern that the absence of a physical contact requirement would encourage fraudulent claims was legitimate. Therefore, we stated that Ã¢ÂÂsome standard of corroboration to support a claimantÃ¢ÂÂs contention that the injuries for which compensation is sought were indeed caused by a hit-and-run motoristÃ¢ÂÂ might be appropriate. (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 382-83. We also recognized our authority, even in the absence of a statutory foundation, to Ã¢ÂÂrequire a claimant, if he is put to his proof, to present some evidence to corroborate his representation of how the accident occurred.Ã¢ÂÂ Id., 383.
In Streitweiser, however, we expressly did not impose a requirement of corroborative evidence for noncontact uninsured motorist claims because the parties in that case had stipulated to the existence of a causal relationship between the plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs injuries and the unidentified vehicle. Id. We therefore neither reached the issue of whether corroborative evidence would be required nor established such a requirement as a matter of law. The issue that we left unresolved in Streitweiser, namely, whether a claimant is required to present some evidence to corroborate his representation of a force and run accident, is squarely before us today.
To begin our analysis, we recognize the valid concerns of insurance companies regarding the potential for fraudulent claims in cases involving an unidentified tortfeasor. We acknowledged this concern in Streit*231weiser when we stated: Ã¢ÂÂIn the absence of physical contact, there is a risk that a claimant may conjure up a phantom motorist to explain a one-car accident for which the claimant was in fact entirely responsible.Ã¢ÂÂ Id., 382. Indeed, some jurisdictions that have rejected a physical contact requirement now oblige a claimant to support his allegations of a phantom driver with some corroborative evidence of the accident. See, e.g., Rogers v. Schuman-Mann Supply Co., 197 Ga. App. 59, 397 S.E.2d 463 (1990); Marakis v. State Farm Fire & Casualty Co., 765 P.2d 882, 885 (Utah 1988); Gobin v. Allstate Ins. Co., 54 Wash. App. 269, 271, 773 P.2d 131 (1989). Also, some states have an expressed corroboration requirement in the governing statute. See, e.g., 24 Ga. Code Ann. ÃÂ§ 33-7-11 (b) (2) (1992); 49 Or. Rev. Stat. Ann. ÃÂ§ 743.792 (g) (B) (1989); Utah Code Ann. ÃÂ§ 31A-22-305 (5) (1991); 5 Wash. Rev. Code ÃÂ§ 48.22.030 (8) (a) (1992).
Other jurisdictions, however, have rejected both a physical contact and a corroboration requirement as contrary to public policy and untenably contrary to the legislative purpose behind uninsured motorist statutes. See Lanzo v. State Farm Mutual Auto Ins. Co., 524 A.2d 47, 50 (Me. 1987); Perez v. American Bankers Ins. Co., 81 N. J. 415, 419, 409 A.2d 269 (1979) (imposition of the requirement of corroboration in noncontact cases adds a substantial condition to the mandated coverage not sanctioned by the legislature); Pin Pin H. Su v. Kemper Ins. Cos./ American Motorists Ins. Co., 431 A.2d 416, 419 (R.I. 1981). These jurisdictions burden the claimant with the same evidentiary standard of proof as in traditional civil actions. We choose to join this latter group.
At the outset, we note that neither our uninsured motorist statute; General Statutes ÃÂ§ 38a-336;14 the per*232tinent regulations,15 nor the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs insurance policy mentions or requires corroborative evidence to support a force and run, uninsured motorist claim. It is well established that the public policy derived from the uninsured motorist legislation is that Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂevery insured is entitled to recover for the damages he or she would have been able to recover if the uninsured motorist had maintained a policy of liability insurance. Insurance companies are powerless to restrict the broad coverage mandated by the statute.Ã¢ÂÂ Harvey v. Travelers Indemnity Co., 188 Conn. 245, 249, 449 A.2d 157 (1982).Ã¢ÂÂ Streitweiser v. Middlesex Mutual Assurance *233Co., supra, 377. The public policy embodied in our uninsured motorist legislation Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂfavors indemnification of accident victims unless they are responsible for the accident.Ã¢ÂÂ Widiss, A Guide to Uninsured Motorist Coverage (1969) ÃÂ§ 2.9, p. 29.Ã¢ÂÂ Harvey v. Travelers Indemnity Co., supra, 250. Therefore, any limitation on the ability of an individual injured by an uninsured motorist to recover benefits for his injuries will have to bear close scrutiny.
We also recognize, however, that the uninsured motorist legislation is designed for the truly innocent and not for the fraudulent policyholder. In determining whether a corroboration requirement is necessary in force and run accidents we must, therefore, balance: (1) the prominent public policy favoring uninsured motorist coverage; (2) the potential for a flood of fraudulent claims; and (3) the potential loss of valid claims that cannot be corroborated by evidence independent of the claimantÃ¢ÂÂs version of the facts. In weighing these concerns, we conclude that the scale must tip in favor of the claimant and that a standard requiring corroborative evidence independent of the claimantÃ¢ÂÂs testimony is not warranted.
The plaintiff argues that allowing a claimant to recover in cases where there are no witnesses and no physical contact, without requiring corroboration, creates a situation that is ripe for fraud. The specter of fraudulent claims, however, should not be determinative of this issue. The fact that some claims might be manufactured by unscrupulous individuals cannot justify the wholesale rejection of all claims in which injury is caused by an unidentified driver simply because the injured party lacks third party witnesses or physical evidence of an unidentified driver.
Indeed, the potential for fraudulent claims was also at issue when the physical contact requirement was *234eliminated in many jurisdictions. For instance, in rejecting an argument that concern for fraud supports the need for a physical contact requirement, the Supreme Court of Hawaii reasoned as follows: Ã¢ÂÂA claimant with a fraudulent claim can bolster the same, if necessary, by damaging his own car to leave apparent proof of the requisite Ã¢ÂÂphysical contactÃ¢ÂÂ with a non-existent Ã¢ÂÂunidentified vehicle.Ã¢ÂÂ The contractual Ã¢ÂÂphysical impactÃ¢ÂÂ requirement thus not only sweeps too broadly, but also not broadly enough, to accomplish its only justifiable and statutorily permissible purpose, the prevention of frauds.Ã¢ÂÂ DeMello v. First Ins. Co. of Hawaii, Ltd., 55 Haw. 519, 529, 523 P.2d 304 (1974). Similarly, a corroboration requirement would accomplish little to prevent fraud if a claimant, so inclined, would bolster his fraudulent claim with sham Ã¢ÂÂeyewitnessesÃ¢ÂÂ or manufactured corroborative evidence.
The lack of a corroboration requirement, like the elimination of a physical contact requirement, does not mean that the claimant no longer carries the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the accident occurred as claimed. In discussing its rejection of the physical contact requirement, the Utah Supreme Court wrote: Ã¢ÂÂApparently, the sole justification for the physical contact requirement is its alleged evidentiary value in providing objective evidence which corroborates the victimÃ¢ÂÂs account of the accident. However, its rejection does not relieve the insuredÃ¢ÂÂs burden of proving his or her case. If the insured can prove to the satisfaction of the fact finder that the accident occurred, he or she may be entitled to recover regardless of the actuality of physical contact.Ã¢ÂÂ Marakis v. State Farm Fire & Casualty Co., supra, 884-85. Likewise, whether a force and run accident occurred as the claimant asserts, despite the absence of corroborative evidence, is a pure question of fact to be determined *235by the trier. Cf. Brown v. Progressive Mutual Ins. Co., 249 So. 2d 429, 430 (Fla. 1971).
The claimant will satisfy his or her burden of proof if the evidence induces in the mind of the trier a reasonable belief that it is more probable than not that the accident occurred in the manner in which the claimant asserts. C. Tait & J. LaPlante, Connecticut Evidence (2d Ed. 1988) ÃÂ§ 4.4.1 (a). The claimantÃ¢ÂÂs evidence need not negate all other possibilities or exclude every other reasonable conclusion. Terminal Taxi Co. v. Flynn, 156 Conn. 313, 318, 240 A.2d 881 (1968). Admittedly, in a case such as the one presently before us, the evidence might be scarce. There may be no eyewitness, the physical evidence at the accident scene may evince nothing more than the fact that an accident occurred, and an accident reconstructionist may only be able to give an expert opinion primarily based on the claimantÃ¢ÂÂs own account of the accident. The paucity of evidence, however, should not defeat the claimantÃ¢ÂÂs right to persuade the trier that his claim is valid.
If the extent of a claimantÃ¢ÂÂs evidence is his or her account of how the accident occurred, then the claimantÃ¢ÂÂs credibility will be tested and evaluated by the trier of fact as in any civil action. Ã¢ÂÂThe credibility of a witness is a matter for the jury and, except in rare instances, there is no requirement that a witnessÃ¢ÂÂs testimony be corroborated by other evidence.Ã¢ÂÂ C. Tait & J. LaPlante, supra, ÃÂ§ 7.30.1.16 The absence of corrobo*236ration, of course, may affect the trierÃ¢ÂÂs decision as to the sufficiency of the evidence and the burden of proof; C. Tait & J. LaPlante, supra; but this factor goes to the weight of the claimantÃ¢ÂÂs case rather than to his or her ability to bring the case before the trier. We see no reason why the traditional tests of credibility, testimony under oath and cross-examination, coupled with the claimantÃ¢ÂÂs burden of proof, are insufficient to provide protection against fraudulent claims.
Where the traditional tests of credibility attend to an insuredÃ¢ÂÂs claim for coverage, a rigid corroboration rule works too harshly on some of those whom the broad remedial purpose of the uninsured motorist legislation is to benefit in the first place. We conclude, therefore, that a claimant alleging that an accident was caused by an unidentified vehicle, even in the absence of physical contact, need not present independent evidence to corroborate how the accident occurred.
The plaintiff argues as an alternative ground to support the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs decision that, even if we reject a corroboration requirement, the burden of proof on a claimant should be Ã¢ÂÂclear and convincing evidenceÃ¢ÂÂ to assure that only valid claims are compensated. The plaintiff argues that because a Ã¢ÂÂclear and convincing evidenceÃ¢ÂÂ standard is required to prove fraud; Alaimo v. Royer, 188 Conn. 36, 39, 448 A.2d 207 (1982); the same standard is also appropriate here because of the potential for fraudulent claims. In essence, the plaintiff is urging us to adopt a standard that would put any claimant under circumstances similar to those of the defendant in the position of disproving fraud, regardless of whether fraud is asserted by the insurer as a defense. This we refuse to do.
We recently rejected the invitation to establish a Ã¢ÂÂclear and convincingÃ¢ÂÂ evidence standard to prove the special defense of concealment or misrepresentation *237in a claim for coverage under an insurance contract. Rego v. Connecticut Ins. Placement Facility, 219 Conn. 339, 344, 593 A.2d 491 (1991). We noted in Rego that the elevated standard of proof applied Ã¢ÂÂsolely to claims of common law fraud, the elements of which are distinct from an insurerÃ¢ÂÂs defense of concealment or misrepresentation.Ã¢ÂÂ Id. We fail to see the logic in requiring a claimant to prove his claim by a higher standard of proof than preponderance of the evidence because of the potential for fraud, whether or not alleged, when an insurer alleging concealment or misrepresentation as a defense would not be subject to that same standard. Elevating the standard of proof in noncontact uninsured motorist cases would not only expand the standard for fraud to any situation in which there is the potential for fraud, but would be contrary to the public policy behind the uninsured motorist legislation.
We conclude that the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that an accident occurred because of an unidentified vehicle provides sufficient assurance of the validity of the claimantÃ¢ÂÂs allegations. This standard adequately addresses the concern for fraud while at the same time maintaining the remedial purposes of our uninsured motorist statutes.
We conclude that the trial court improperly granted the plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs motion to vacate the arbitration award because of the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs failure to provide independent corroborative evidence of an unidentified vehicle causing the accident. Having reviewed the record, we further conclude that without the need for corroborative evidence, there was a substantial basis in the evidence to confirm the arbitratorsÃ¢ÂÂ award. See Chmielewski v. Aetna Casualty & Surety Co., 218 Conn. 646, 660, 591 A.2d 101 (1991); Connecticut Building Wrecking Co. v. Carothers, 218 Conn. 580, 593, 590 A.2d 447 (1991).
*238The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment confirming the arbitratorsÃ¢ÂÂ award.
In this opinion the other justices concurred.

 A force and run accident is one in which an unidentified vehicle forces the driver of another vehicle into an accident without making contact with that other vehicle.


 The defendantÃ¢ÂÂs wife testified before the arbitration panel that her impression that the defendant had fallen asleep at the wheel may have come from a newspaper account of the accident published that same morning.


 The plaintiff s policies in effect at the time of the accident included within the definition of an Ã¢ÂÂuninsured motor vehicleÃ¢ÂÂ a motor vehicle Ã¢ÂÂ[wjhich is a hit and run vehicle whose operator or owner cannot be identified and which hits . . . you or any Ã¢ÂÂfamily memberÃ¢ÂÂ . . . .Ã¢ÂÂ


 The defendant testified before the arbitration panel: Ã¢ÂÂ[A]s I came around the curve, from out of a dirt driveway came a yellow 1975 or 1976 Pontiac or Chevrolet station wagon; I had a choice to get out of the way or try to swerve around him, and when I did, I saw a telephone pole, and I dived [sic] to the floor of my car and broke my neck and scarred up my face and broke my shoulder.Ã¢ÂÂ The defendant also testified that he did not report this to investigating officers because they did not come to see him and he could not see them because of his condition.


 The defendant apparently did not recall telling his brother how the accident had occurred because he testified that his first recollection of the accident was several weeks later.


 Evidence had been introduced that the defendant had consumed approximately a full bottle of wine on the night of the accident between 6 p.m. and 12:30 a.m. The defendantÃ¢ÂÂs brother testified that routine police procedure would be to obtain a warrant for an individualÃ¢ÂÂs medical records if liquor is detected on a driverÃ¢ÂÂs breath after a serious accident, which was not done with respect to the defendant. The defendantÃ¢ÂÂs brother also testified that if no other car had been involved in the accident there might have been a motor vehicle violation on the part of the defendant, but that the defendant was never charged with one after the accident.


 The motor vehicle accident report reflected in pertinent part: Ã¢ÂÂ[The] unknown vehicle entered the road from the right out of a private drive. *227To avoid colliding with the unknown vehicle, vehicle #1 [the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs] cut into the left lane on the curve and struck a utility pole on the left shoulder of the roadway.Ã¢ÂÂ


 One arbitrator dissented, finding that there was insufficient proof to sustain the existence of a phantom car.


 The plaintiff had issued a policy to the defendant covering three vehicles at $100,000 each. The parties stipulated that this policy was in effect *228at the time of the accident and that the aggregate uninsured motorist coverage amounted to $300,000.


 Ã¢ÂÂ[General Statutes] Sec. 52-418. vacating award, (a) Upon the application of any party to an arbitration, the superior court for the judicial district in which one of the parties resides or, in a controversy concerning land, for the judicial district in which the land is situated or, when the court is not in session, any judge thereof, shall make an order vacating the award if it finds any of the following defects: (1) If the award has been procured by corruption, fraud or undue means; (2) if there has been evident partiality or corruption on the part of any arbitrator; (3) if the arbitrators have been guilty of misconduct in refusing to postpone the hearing upon sufficient cause shown or in refusing to hear evidence pertinent and material to the controversy or of any other action by which the rights of any party have been prejudiced; or (4) if the arbitrators have exceeded their powers or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual, final and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made.
Ã¢ÂÂ(b) If an award is vacated and the time within which the award is required to be rendered has not expired, the court or judge may direct a rehearing by the arbitrators.
""(c) Any party filing an application pursuant to subsection (a) of this section concerning an arbitration award issued by the state board of mediation and arbitration shall notify said board and the attorney general, in writing, of such filing within five days of the date of filing.Ã¢ÂÂ


 The defendant, in response, filed a motion to confirm the arbitration award pursuant to General Statutes ÃÂ§ 52-417, which provides: Ã¢ÂÂAt any time within one year after an award has been rendered and the parties to the arbitration notified thereof, any party to the arbitration may make application to the superior court for the judicial district in which one of the parties resides or, in a controversy concerning land, for the judicial district in which the land is situated or, when the court is not in session, to any judge thereof, for an order confirming the award. The court or judge shall *229grant such an order confirming the award unless the award is vacated, modified or corrected as prescribed in sections 52-418 and 52-419.Ã¢ÂÂ Both motions were heard by the trial court on October 28, 1991, and the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs motion was denied on November 6, 1991.


 The defendant also argues that the trial court improperly: (1) determined that the defendant had caused his own injuries because there was substantial evidence to confirm the arbitratorsÃ¢ÂÂ award; and (2) determined that the defendant had failed to corroborate his claim. Because we agree with the defendant that the trial court improperly read Streitweiser v. Middlesex Mutual Assurance Co., 219 Conn. 371, 593 A.2d 498 (1991), to require corroborative evidence to collect uninsured motorist benefits in a force and run accident, we do not directly address these remaining claims.


 See Streitweiser v. Middlesex Mutual Assurance Co., 219 Conn. 371, 381-82, 593 A.2d 498 (1991), for a comprehensive list of the jurisdictions that have either rejected or accepted the physical contact requirement.


 General Statutes ÃÂ§ 38a-336, formerly ÃÂ§ 38-175c, provides in pertinent part: Ã¢ÂÂuninsured motorist coverage, (a) (1) Each automobile liability *232insurance policy shall provide insurance, herein called uninsured motorist coverage, in accordance with the regulations adopted pursuant to section 38a-334, with limits for bodily injury or death not less than those specified in subsection (a) of section 14-112, for the protection of persons insured thereunder who are legally entitled to recover damages from owners or operators of uninsured motor vehicles and underinsured motor vehicles and insured motor vehicles, the insurer of which becomes insolvent prior to payment of such damages, because of bodily injury, including death resulting therefrom. Bach insurer licensed to write automobile liability insurance in this state shall provide uninsured motorists coverage with limits requested by the named insured upon payment of the appropriate premium, but the insurer shall not be required to provide such coverage with limits in excess of the limits of the bodily injury coverage of the policy issued to the named insured. No insurer shall be required to provide uninsured motorist coverage to (A) a named insured or relatives residing in his household when occupying, or struck as a pedestrian by, an uninsured or underinsured motor vehicle or a motorcycle that is owned by the named insured, or (B) to any insured occupying an uninsured or underinsured motor vehicle or motorcycle that is owned by such insured.Ã¢ÂÂ


 The Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies, ÃÂ§ 38a-334-6, formerly ÃÂ§ 38-175a-6, provides in pertinent part: Ã¢ÂÂminimum PROVISION FOR PROTECTION AGAINST UNINSURED MOTORISTS
Ã¢ÂÂ(a) coverage. The insurer shall undertake to pay on behalf of the insured all sums which the insured shall be legally entitled to recover as damages from the owner or operator of an uninsured motor vehicle because of bodily injury sustained by the insured caused by an accident involving the uninsured motor vehicle. This coverage shall insure the occupants of every motor vehicle to which the bodily injury liability coverage applies. Ã¢ÂÂUninsured motor vehicleÃ¢ÂÂ includes a motor vehicle insured against liability by an insurer that is or becomes insolvent.Ã¢ÂÂ


 Indeed, in Connecticut jurisprudence we find several instances where corroborating evidence is specifically not required. See Public Acts 1974, No. 74-131, repealing General Statutes ÃÂ§ 53a-68 (testimony of the alleged victim of a sex offense need not be corroborated to sustain a conviction); Jarrett v. Jarrett, 151 Conn. 180, 182, 195 A.2d 430 (1963) (Ã¢ÂÂif a ground for divorce has been clearly established, a party is not precluded from a judgment dissolving the marriage by reason of the fact that his evidence lacked corroboration by other witnessesÃ¢ÂÂ); In re Robert K., 12 Conn. App. 585, 589-90, 532 A.2d 1319 (1987) (uncorroborated testimony of a child abuse victim is sufficient).

Borden, J.
The dispositive issue in these three appeals is whether, under the circumstances of the trial court proceedings, there is a final judgment for purposes of appeal.1 We conclude that there is no final judgment and, accordingly, dismiss the appeals.
Certain facts and the procedural history are undisputed. On December 30,1971, the defendant John C. Van Gilder, a neurosurgeon, performed an operation on the plaintiff, Arthur L. Robbins, at the defendant Yale-New Haven Hospital (hospital), in New Haven. On August 17, 1984, Robbins commenced this action by serving Van Gilder, the hospital, and the defendant Yale University (medical school)2 with a complaint returnable on September 18, 1984.3
*240The final version of RobbinsÃ¢ÂÂ complaint was in three counts. The first count was against all the defendants. In that count, Robbins alleged that Van Gilder, as a member of the hospitalÃ¢ÂÂs neurosurgical staff, was an employee of the hospital, and was an employee of the medical school as an associate professor of neurosurgical medicine. Robbins alleged that Van Gilder had been negligent in the operation he performed on Robbins on December 30, 1971, ÃÂ¡nd had caused Robbins serious and permanent injury.
In the second count, also against all three defendants, Robbins alleged that Van Gilder had failed to inform him of Van GilderÃ¢ÂÂs negligence. He further alleged that Van GilderÃ¢ÂÂs failure so to inform him, and that Van GilderÃ¢ÂÂs repeated assurances to him that he would fully recover, had fraudulently concealed from him the fact that he had suffered actionable harm. Robbins further alleged that, as a result of that fraudulent concealment, he did not discover and could not have reasonably discovered that he had suffered actionable harm until he received a letter, dated August 2,1982, informing him that the December 30, 1971 operation had been performed negligently.
The third count was against the hospital only. In that count, Robbins alleged that the hospital had failed to inform him that the operation had been negligently performed and that he had suffered actionable harm. He also alleged that the hospital had failed to monitor its staff and had failed to have a reporting system regarding the negligence of its staff that would have informed him that he had suffered actionable harm. He further alleged that the hospital had been engaged in a continuous course of conduct, consisting of treatment of him for the injuries he had suffered in the December 30, 1971 operation, and that, as a result, the statute of limitations governing his cause of action does not begin to run until that course of conduct ceases.
*241The defendants all pleaded the statute of limitations as a special defense, as well as denying the essential allegations of the complaint.4 In reply, Robbins alleged that: (1) the defendants should be estopped from asserting the statute of limitations because, due to their negligence, he had suffered brain damage that affected his ability to understand completely the nature and extent of what had happened to him, and to understand whether he could have had a claim for damages against the defendants; (2) the statute of limitations, General Statutes ÃÂ§ 52-584,5 would be unconstitutional if applied to him; and (3) as to Van Gilder, the statute of limitations had been tolled in part pursuant to General Statutes ÃÂ§ 52-590.6
On these pleadings, the case was tried to a jury in February and early March, 1991. At the end of the plaintiffs case and at the end of all the evidence, the defendants moved for directed verdicts in their favor. The trial court, D. Dorsey, J., reserved decision on these motions.
*242The trial court submitted to the jury five special interrogatories, described and discussed infra. In its instructions to the jury, the trial court ordered the jury to return verdicts for the defendants on the second and third counts, for the following reasons. With respect to the second count, based on fraudulent concealment, the trial court stated that the claim Ã¢ÂÂis subsumed in the plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs reply to the statute of limitations defense . . . that [the] defendants fraudulently concealed [the] plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs cause of action. It would only confuse you if I left the Second Count in the case and the removal does not, in fact, prejudice the plaintiff.Ã¢ÂÂ
With respect to the third count, alleging independent negligence against the hospital and a continuous course of treatment by the hospital to overcome the statute of limitations defense, the trial court stated that the independent negligence claim failed for lack of expert testimony. With respect to the continuing course of treatment allegation, the court stated that Ã¢ÂÂ[t]his claim is also subsumed in plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs reply to the special defense of the defendant. This states the defendant continuously treated the plaintiff on or about December, 1971, and through and beyond July, 1984. Here again, permitting this to remain would cause confusion. Its removal from the complaint will not prejudice the defense since my instruction put this claim as well as fraudulent concealment in proper perspective under the reply. Therefore IÃ¢ÂÂm directing you to return a defendantÃ¢ÂÂs verdict on the Third Count.Ã¢ÂÂ
On March 11, 1991, the jury returned a verdict on the first count (1) in favor of the plaintiff, in the amount of $1,550,000, against Van Gilder and the medical school, and (2) in favor of the hospital.7 With regard *243to that count, however, the jury also answered the five special interrogatories submitted to it as follows: (1) Van Gilder was negligent in connection with the surgery he performed on Robbins on December 30,1971; (2) Van GilderÃ¢ÂÂs negligence was the proximate cause of RobbinsÃ¢ÂÂ injuries and the damages claimed by Robbins; (3) Van Gilder was an agent of the hospital in connection with the surgery; (4) the claims of Robbins as to negligence and damages in connection with the performance of the surgery were barred by the statute of limitations; and (5) Robbins had not proven by clear, precise and unequivocal evidence that Van Gilder had fraudulently concealed the fact that Robbins Ã¢ÂÂhad suffered some form of actionable harm during the course of the surgery on December 30, 1971, so as to toll or suspend the statute of limitations.Ã¢ÂÂ8 The ver*244diet and the interrogatories conflicted with each other, therefore, in at least the following ways: (1) the verdict found Van Gilder and the medical school liable to Robbins, despite the specific findings that RobbinsÃ¢ÂÂ claim was barred by the statute of limitations and that Robbins had not proven that Van Gilder had fraudulently concealed the cause of action; and (2) the verdict found the medical school, but not the hospital, liable as Van GilderÃ¢ÂÂs principal, despite the specific finding that Van Gilder had been the agent of the hospital.
After the clerk read the verdict and inquired of the jury whether it was their verdict,9 the court directed the clerk to read the interrogatories and answers. The trial court thereupon informed the jury that it could not accept the verdict because the verdict was inconsistent with the answers to the interrogatories regarding the statute of limitations, and returned the jury to the deliberation room for reconsideration of its verdict and its answers to the interrogatories.10
*245Van Gilder, the medical school and the hospital then moved for directed verdicts in their favor, upon the basis of the juryÃ¢ÂÂs answers to the interrogatories, and Robbins moved that the court accept the juryÃ¢ÂÂs verdict, irrespective of those answers. After the court denied the defendantsÃ¢ÂÂ motions for a directed verdict, Van Gilder and the medical school moved for a mistrial upon the basis of the juryÃ¢ÂÂs confusion. The court took no action on RobbinsÃ¢ÂÂ motion to accept the verdict, or on Van GilderÃ¢ÂÂs and the medical schoolÃ¢ÂÂs motion for a mistrial.
At that point, the jury submitted the first of what would ultimately be five written questions or other communications to the court. This first question asked: Ã¢ÂÂWhy does an award for negligence have to be combined with fraudulent concealment^] We thought they were two separate issues. We were awarding for negligence exclusive of fraudulent concealment.Ã¢ÂÂ Van Gilder and the medical school thereupon renewed their motion for a directed verdict and, after the court denied that motion, renewed their motion for a mistrial.
The jury then submitted the second question to the court: Ã¢ÂÂWhat constitutes medical fraud?Ã¢ÂÂ At that point all three defendantsÃ¢ÂÂVan Gilder, the medical school and the hospitalÃ¢ÂÂmoved for a mistrial. The trial court then returned the jury to the courtroom and reinstructed it, in response to the juryÃ¢ÂÂs first question, on the issue of the statute of limitations and the relationship between that issue and the issue of fraudulent con*246cealment. In the course of those instructions, moreover, the court explained why the juryÃ¢ÂÂs answer to the interrogatory regarding Van GilderÃ¢ÂÂs agency was inconsistent with its verdict.11 The court then provided the jury with new verdict forms and a clean set of the same interrogatories.
At that point the jury submitted the following request: Ã¢ÂÂTo reconsider medical fraud we would like our second question answered.Ã¢ÂÂ The court then, again, returned the jury to the courtroom and reinstructed it on the relationship between the statute of limitations defense and issue of fraudulent concealment of a cause of action. The defendants then renewed their motions for a directed verdict and, in the alternative, a mistrial. The court denied these motions.
The jury then submitted the following statement to the trial court: Ã¢ÂÂWe understood that the statute of limitations was barred if the lawsuit was brought within two to three years after discovery[.] We believe discovery is 1982.Ã¢ÂÂ The defendants again renewed their motions for a mistrial. The court then returned the jury to the courtroom once again and, after informing the jury that its note was not in the form of a question, read the statute of limitations; see footnote 5; to the jury. The court then instructed the jury that Ã¢ÂÂI donÃ¢ÂÂt know what your question is, from reading this [note]. If you have a question youÃ¢ÂÂll have to write it out.Ã¢ÂÂ The jury orally informed the court: Ã¢ÂÂBy reading the statute you answered the question.Ã¢ÂÂ The court then adjourned for the day.
The next day, March 12, 1991, began with the fifth of the juryÃ¢ÂÂs written communications to the court: (1) *247Ã¢ÂÂCould we have a copy of the law on fraud? [2] If we canÃ¢ÂÂt we would like to here [sic] you (the judge) talk about the law on fraud again? [3] Could we also here [sic] about the statute of limitations? Or a copy of?Ã¢ÂÂ The defendants then renewed their motions for a directed verdict. The plaintiff urged the court to follow the procedure provided in General Statutes ÃÂ§ 52-223.12 The defendants objected to that procedure, and again renewed their motions for a directed verdict or, in the alternative, suggested that Ã¢ÂÂthe judgment has to be made at this point that this situation is so far out of control and that there just isnÃ¢ÂÂt any judicial way to resolve it, here and now, other than by way of a mistrial.Ã¢ÂÂ The court then stated that Ã¢ÂÂI have given consideration to the verdict forms, to the interrogatories, the series of questions from the jury. And I am convinced that the jury is hopelessly confused.Ã¢ÂÂ The court, therefore, declared a mistrial.
Thereafter, the parties filed the following written motions: (1) the plaintiff moved for judgment against the defendants in the amount of $ 1,550,000, in accordance with the juryÃ¢ÂÂs verdict; (2) the defendants moved for a directed verdict notwithstanding the failure of the jury to return a verdict, pursuant to Practice Book ÃÂ§ 321;13 and (3) the defendants moved for judgment in *248accordance with their motions for a directed verdict, based upon the juryÃ¢ÂÂs answers to the interrogatories regarding the statute of limitations. In a written memorandum of decision, the trial court denied all the motions, maintaining its order of a mistrial.
The parties thereafter took the following appeals to the Appellate Court, which we transferred to this court pursuant to Practice Book ÃÂ§ 4023 and General Statutes ÃÂ§ 51-199 (c). Van Gilder and the medical school filed an appeal, Docket No. 14453, claiming that the trial court improperly (1) denied the motions for summary judgment; see footnote 4; (2) denied their motions for a directed verdict made at the close of the plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs case and at the close of all the evidence; and (3) denied their posttrial motions for judgment. In response, Robbins argues that: (1) a denial of a motion for summary judgment is not reviewable on appeal after a full trial on the merits; see Greengarden v. Kuhn, 13 Conn. App. 550, 552, 537 A.2d 1043 (1988); and (2) Van GilderÃ¢ÂÂs and the medical schoolÃ¢ÂÂs second and third claims are not reviewable Ã¢ÂÂfor lack of a final judgment,Ã¢ÂÂ based upon the authority of Gold v. Newman, 211 Conn. 631, 560 A.2d 960 (1989).
Robbins filed an appeal, Docket No. 14454, claiming that: (1) the trial court should have granted his motion *249to accept the juryÃ¢ÂÂs verdict and should not have ordered a mistrial; and (2) the juryÃ¢ÂÂs answers to the interrogatories regarding the statute of limitations did not affect the validity of its verdict because (a) there was no basis for the courtÃ¢ÂÂs conclusion that the jury was hopelessly confused, (b) those answers can be harmonized with the verdict, and (c) the three year statute of repose contained in ÃÂ§ 52-584 is unconstitutional as applied to Robbins in this case. In response, the defendants argue that: (1) the trial court was not obligated to accept the verdict; (2) the trial court correctly determined that the juryÃ¢ÂÂs answers to the interrogatories were inconsistent with the verdict; and (3) ÃÂ§ 52-58Ã¢ÂÂ4 is constitutional as applied to Robbins.
The hospital filed an appeal, Docket No. 14455, claiming that the trial court should have granted its motions for a directed verdict and for judgment notwithstanding the failure of the jury to reach a verdict because: (1) there was no evidence that Van Gilder had been the agent of the hospital; (2) the evidence clearly showed that RobbinsÃ¢ÂÂ cause of action was barred by the statute of limitations and that there was no fraudulent concealment by the hospital; and (3) the court properly directed verdicts in favor of the hospital on counts two and three. Robbins responds that: (1) the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs denial of the hospitalÃ¢ÂÂs motions for a directed verdict and for judgment notwithstanding the failure of the jury to reach a verdict are not reviewable for lack of a final judgment, under Gold v. Newman, supra; and (2) the issues related to counts two and three remain in the case, nevertheless, because the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs action in directing the verdicts was based upon its determination that the same factual and legal issues were contained in the first count and the defense thereto, and the defendants moved for the mistrial that the court ultimately ordered.
*250Having trekked this tortuous procedural path, we turn to the question of whether, at its end, there is a final judgment upon which our jurisdiction may rest. We conclude that there is not.
In Gold v. Newman, supra, 632, the trial court declared a mistrial after some of the jurors informed the court that they could not disregard certain depositions that had inadvertently and improperly been given to them during their deliberations. The defendants then moved for judgment in accordance with their previous motions for a directed verdict. The trial court denied these motions, and the defendants appealed. Id.
This court dismissed the appeal for lack of a final judgment. We held that the denial of a motion for judgment notwithstanding the failure of the jury to return a verdict is not a final judgment upon which an appeal may be based. Id. We stated that, in that case, the order denying the motion Ã¢ÂÂ[left] in effect the declaration of a mistrial, and a second trial in the normal course of events will follow. No rights of the parties have been yet determined.Ã¢ÂÂ Id., 635; see State v. Curcio, 191 Conn. 27, 31, 463 A.2d 566 (.1983); Prevedini v. Mobil Oil Corporation, 164 Conn. 287, 292, 320 A.2d 797 (1973).
In Gold, we also recognized that the granting by the trial court of a motion to set aside a verdict and to grant a new trial is an appealable order. That decision, however, is not appealable because such an order is a Ã¢ÂÂfinal judgmentÃ¢ÂÂ within the meaning of the principal appeal statute; General Statutes ÃÂ§ 52-263;14 but because that *251statute specifically provides for an appeal from such an order as an alternative to the Ã¢ÂÂfinal judgmentÃ¢ÂÂ basis of appeal. Gold v. Newman, supra, 637. We also recognized in Gold that Ã¢ÂÂthe granting of a motion for a new trial, which opens the judgment previously rendered, does not qualify as a final judgment from which an appeal may be taken.Ã¢ÂÂ Id.
In Gold, moreover, the defendants argued that permitting an appeal at that procedural point might conserve judicial resources by avoiding the necessity of a second trial. Id., 638. We reasoned, however, that: (1) Ã¢ÂÂ[t]he legislature, by creating specific alternatives to a final judgment as a basis for appeal, has implicitly rejected other grounds for departing from the final judgment ruleÃ¢ÂÂ; and (2) Ã¢ÂÂ[t]he fact that a second trial will ordinarily entail additional expense to the parties does not measure up to the circumstances we have heretofore regarded as having such a serious effect upon the rights of the parties that an appeal is warranted.Ã¢ÂÂ Id.
Applying the reasoning of Gold to the facts of this case compels the conclusion that there is no basis for an appeal. As in Gold, the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs declaration of a mistrial will lead to a second trial. Thus, there is no final judgment under ÃÂ§ 52-263 because Ã¢ÂÂ[n]o rights of the parties have been yet determined.Ã¢ÂÂ Id., 635. As in Gold, the parties can offer no specific statutory basis, other than the final judgment rule embodied in ÃÂ§ 52-263, for an appeal. As in Gold, the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs denial of the defendantsÃ¢ÂÂ motions for a directed verdict and for judgment notwithstanding the failure of the jury to reach a verdict did not provide the basis for an appeal. Indeed, Robbins implicitly recognized the *252applicability of Gold by arguing in his brief that the defendantsÃ¢ÂÂ claims were not reviewable for lack of a final judgment. What Robbins failed to recognize, however, was that the same sauce he attempted to spread on the defendantsÃ¢ÂÂ goose also necessarily graced his own gander.15 Finally, as Gold recognized, these proceedings produced no more of a final judgment for purposes of an appeal than would have an order, opening a judgment previously rendered, entered upon a motion for a new trial.
Robbins suggests that Gold is distinguishable because, unlike Gold, in this case the jury returned a verdict. We think that this is a distinction without a difference.
Practice Book ÃÂ§ 31216 strongly suggests that ordinarily a general verdict and the answers to its accompanying interrogatories are inseparable. The purpose of the interrogatories is to explain or limit the verdict. Id. The interrogatories are to be Ã¢ÂÂanswered and delivered to the clerk as a part of the verdict.Ã¢ÂÂ Id. Furthermore, Ã¢ÂÂ[t]he court will not accept a verdict until the interrogatories which are essential to the verdict have been answered.Ã¢ÂÂ Id.
As the trial court recognized, the verdict and the answers irreconcilably conflicted with each other. Furthermore, the court made three efforts, by twice rein*253structing the jury and by rereading the statute of limitations to the jury, to dispel the juryÃ¢ÂÂs obvious confusion. These efforts, however, yielded only continuing confusionÃ¢ÂÂdescribed by the trial court as Ã¢ÂÂhopelessÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ as evidenced by the juryÃ¢ÂÂs questions and other communications. Although the trial court retained discretion to follow the procedure provided by ÃÂ§ 52-223; see footnote 12; it was not required to do so. This hopeless confusion, rendering the jury unable to. return a verdict and answers that were consistent with each other despite the courtÃ¢ÂÂs repeated instructions, was functionally equivalent to the Gold juryÃ¢ÂÂs inability Ã¢ÂÂto disregard certain depositions inadvertently given to the jury during their deliberations, despite the courtÃ¢ÂÂs instructions to do so.Ã¢ÂÂ Gold v. Newman, supra, 632. Undey these circumstances, therefore, the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs conduct must be regarded as having vitiated this verdict, and the verdict must be regarded as a nullity. Consequently, this case was in the same posture as Gold: the denial of a motion for judgment notwithstanding the failure of the jury to return a verdict. Id., 635.17
Robbins also suggests that dismissing this appeal, in which the trial court declared a mistrial after a Ã¢ÂÂverdict,Ã¢ÂÂ albeit internally inconsistent, had been returned, will be unwise precedent. He argues that such a holding will permit some future, less conscientious trial judge to declare a mistrial after the jury has returned a perfectly valid verdict, simply because the trial judge may disagree with the verdict, without the ability of the parties to rectify such an injustice on appeal. We are not persuaded.
*254First, we are not prepared to indulge in the speculation that any Superior Court judge would engage in such an extreme departure from the basic norms of judicial conduct. We know of no case in which that has happened, we doubt that any judge would read this opinion as an invitation to do so, and we doubt that it ever will occur. We decline to carve out an exception to our ordinary rules of appellate jurisdiction solely upon the basis of such an unlikely risk.
Second, the fear implicit in that argument has no basis in the record of this case. Here, the trial court had, at the least, a plausible basis for its conclusion that the verdict was invalid and that the jury could not be relied upon to return a more intelligible verdict.
Third, even if that very unlikely event ever did occur, it would not necessarily go unremedied. If there were such a valid verdict returned that the trial court inexplicably ignored by declaring a mistrial, the party whom the verdict favored would be entitled to raise as a claim of error, on appeal from the second trial, the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs failure to render judgment on that verdict, Ã¢ÂÂif the second trial should result in a judgment against [him].Ã¢ÂÂ Gold v. Newman, supra, 636.
The defendants argue that the directed verdicts on the second and third counts provide a jurisdictional basis for their appeals. We disagree.
It is clear from this record that the trial court directed those verdicts, not because it perceived there to be insufficient evidence on those counts, but because it believed that the same factual and legal issues were being litigated under the first count, the special defense of the statute of limitations and the reply of fraudulent concealment. Furthermore, the defendants repeatedly moved for a mistrial, which the trial court ultimately granted. A mistrial leads to a new trial, not to an appeal. Id., 637. They cannot now be heard to *255complain about the new trial, without an intervening appeal, that they repeatedly sought by their motions. Finally, the first count of the complaint is directed against all the defendants. Even under the defendantsÃ¢ÂÂ argument, that count remains to be retried. Thus, their rights have not yet been determined.
The appeals are dismissed.
In this opinion Callahan, Katz and F. X. HenNESSY, Js., concurred.

 We directed the parties to discuss at oral-argument the question of whether there is a final judgment for purposes of appeal.


 The claim against Yale University was based upon the fact that Van Gilder had been, at the time of the operation, an associate professor of neurosurgical medicine at the Yale University School of Medicine. The parties have, therefore, termed this claim as one against the medical school. We do likewise, and refer herein to the defendant university as the medical school.


 Also named as defendants were neurosurgeons Joan L. Venes and Daniel C. Good, and nurse anesthetist Patricia Baron. The case was ultimately withdrawn against Venes, Good and Baron, and they are not involved in this appeal. We therefore consider only Van Gilder, the hospital and the medical school as the defendants in this case.


 Furthermore, Van Gilder and the hospital moved for summary judgment upon the basis of the statute of limitations. The trial court, Cretella, J., denied these motions.


 General Statutes ÃÂ§ 52-584 provides: Ã¢ÂÂLIMITATION OF ACTION FOR injury to person or property. No action to recover damages for injury to the person, or to real or personal property, caused by negligence, or by reckless or wanton misconduct, or by malpractice of a physician, surgeon, dentist, podiatrist, chiropractor, hospital or sanatorium, shall be brought but within two years from the date when the injury is first sustained or discovered or in the exercise of reasonable care should have been discovered, and except that no such action may be brought more than three years from the date of the act or omission complained of, except that a counterclaim may be interposed in any such action any time before the pleadings in such action are finally closed.Ã¢ÂÂ


 General Statutes ÃÂ§ 52-590 provides: Ã¢ÂÂwhen defendantÃ¢ÂÂs absence from state to be excluded. In computing the time limited in the period of limitation prescribed under any provision of chapter 925 or this chapter, the time during which the party, against whom there may be any such cause of action, is without this state shall be excluded from the computation, except that the time so excluded shall not exceed seven years.Ã¢ÂÂ


 The two verdict forms returned by the jury on the first count, dated and signed by the foreperson, were as follows: (1) a plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs verdict form, indicating that the jury had found the issues in favor of Robbins as against Van Gilder and the medical school, and finding the damages to be $1,550,000; *243and (2) a defendantÃ¢ÂÂs verdict form finding the issues for the hospital. The record also discloses verdict forms for the defendants on the second and third counts, in accordance with the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs instructions, signed by the foreperson and dated March 12, 1991.


 More specifically, the interrogatories and answers thereto were as follows:
Ã¢ÂÂInterrogatories For Jury

Answer YES
5. Did the plaintiff prove by Ã¢ÂÂclear, precise and unequivocal evidenceÃ¢ÂÂ that the defendant Dr. John Van Gilder fraudulently concealed the fact that the plaintiff had suffered some form of actionable harm during the course of the surgery on December 30,1971, so as to toll or suspend the statute of limitations?
Answer NOÃ¢ÂÂ


 The clerk asked: Ã¢ÂÂLadies and Gentlemen of the jury, is this your verdict so say you all?Ã¢ÂÂ The jury answered Ã¢ÂÂYes.Ã¢ÂÂ


 The court instructed the jury: Ã¢ÂÂLadies and Gentlemen, I canÃ¢ÂÂt [accept] your verdict because there is a complete inconsistency between the interrogatories and the verdict forms. And the inconsistency consists of the fact that you found that the action was tolled by the statute of limitations, which means that it was barred by the statute of limitations. And thenÃ¢ÂÂthe only way then that it couldÃ¢ÂÂthat you could find that the plaintiff could recover would be if you found fraud. If you found that there was no fraud, then you could not allow any verdict for the plaintiff. So, I cannot [accept] your verdict form under those circumstances. That is why the interrogatories were submitted to you, to determine whether you had considered all of the elements of negligence, approximate [sic] cause, statute of limitations and *245fraud and agency. Secondly, if you found that youÃ¢ÂÂthat Dr. Van Gilder was the agent of the Yale-New Haven Hospital, you would have to logically, and consistently find that the Hospital was also responsible. And under those circumstances you found just the opposite. So, I am going to ask you to go back and reconsider your verdict in this particular case, in view of the interrogatories and I am going to ask you to reconsider the whole thing the interrogatories as well, as well as the verdict. But, again, if the claim is barred by the statute of limitations, there can be no recovery unless thereÃ¢ÂÂunless fraud was proven. So, IÃ¢ÂÂll send you back to reconsider.Ã¢ÂÂ


 None of the parties raises any question regarding the legal propriety, accuracy, clarity or completeness of the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs original instructions on the statute of limitations, or regarding the reinstructions by the trial court.


 General Statutes ÃÂ§ 52-223 provides: Ã¢ÂÂjury may be three times returned TO CONSIDER verdict. The court may, if it judges the jury has mistaken the evidence in the action and has brought in a verdict contrary to the evidence, or has brought in a verdict contrary to the direction of the court in a matter of law, return them to a second consideration, and for the same reason may return them to a third consideration. The jury shall not be returned for further consideration after a third consideration.Ã¢ÂÂ


 Practice Book ÃÂ§ 321 provides: Ã¢ÂÂreservation of decision on motion FOR DIRECTED VERDICT
Ã¢ÂÂWhenever a motion for a directed verdict made at any time after the close of the plaintiffs case in chief is denied or for any reason is not granted, the court is deemed to have submitted the action to the jury subject to a later determination of the legal questions raised by the motion. The defendant may offer evidence in the event the motion is not granted, without hav*248ing reserved the right to do so and to the same extent as if the motion had not been made. After the acceptance of a verdict and within the time stated in Sec. 320 for filing a motion to set a verdict aside, a party who has moved for a directed verdict may move to have the verdict and any judgment rendered thereon set aside and have judgment rendered in accordance with his motion for a directed verdict; or if a verdict was not returned such party may move for judgment in accordance with his motion for a directed verdict within the aforesaid time after the jury have been discharged from consideration of the case. If a verdict was returned the court may allow the judgment to stand or may set the verdict aside and either order a new trial or direct the entry of judgment as if the requested verdict had been directed. If no verdict was returned the court may direct the entry of judgment as if the requested verdict had been directed or may order a new trial.Ã¢ÂÂ


 General Statutes ÃÂ§ 52-263 provides: Ã¢ÂÂappeals from superior court, exceptions. Upon the trial of all matters of fact in any cause or action in the superior court, whether to the court or jury, or before any judge thereof when the jurisdiction of any action or proceeding is vested in him, if either party is aggrieved by the decision of the court or judge upon any question or questions of law arising in the trial, including the denial of a motion to set aside a verdict, he may appeal to the court having jurisdic*251tion from the final judgment of the court or of such judge, or from the decision of the court granting a motion to set aside a verdict, except in small claims cases, which shall not be appealable, and appeals as provided in sections 8-8 and 8-9.Ã¢ÂÂ


 Ã¢ÂÂWhatÃ¢ÂÂs sauce for the goose is sauce for the ganderÃ¢ÂÂ has been attributed to Marcus Varro. Translated from the Latin in John RayÃ¢ÂÂs English Proverbs (1670). See State v. Fernandez, 5 Conn. App. 40, 52 n.4, 496 A.2d 533 (1985).


 Practice Book ÃÂ§ 312 provides: Ã¢ÂÂinterrogatories
Ã¢ÂÂThe court may submit to the jury interrogatories for the purpose of explaining or limiting a general verdict, which shall be answered and delivered to the clerk as a part of the verdict. The clerk will take the verdict and then the answers to the several interrogatories, and thereafter he will take the courtÃ¢ÂÂs acceptance of the verdict returned and the questions as answered, and proceed according to the usual practice. The court will not accept a verdict until the interrogatories which are essential to the verdict have been answered.Ã¢ÂÂ


 The dissent suggests that the trial court should nonetheless have accepted the verdict and then set it aside so as to create a viable appeal. Thus, under this reasoning, the trial court would have been compelled to accept a verdict that it knew was inherently contradictory, that was legally flawed and that would have had to be reversed on appeal. We decline to limit the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs discretion to reject an irrational jury verdict for the purpose of expanding the proper limits of our appellate jurisdiction.

Berdon, J.,
dissenting. The issue raised by the majority on its own is quite simple. Does the Supreme Court have jurisdiction to hear an appeal from the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs declaration of a mistrial after the jury returned a verdict that the trial court refused to accept? I dissent, not because I would necessarily end up with a different bottom line on the merits, but because the issue of jurisdiction could be important in other cases in which the trial court refuses to accept a verdict and then declares a mistrial. I believe that we do have jurisdiction and should reach the merits of the case as briefed by the parties.1
In this medical malpractice case, the jury rendered a verdict in favor of the plaintiff, Arthur L. Robbins, against two defendants, John C. Van Gilder and the Yale University School of Medicine, in the amount of $1,550,000.2 The verdict was acknowledged by the *256jurors in open court. The trial court, over the objection of the plaintiff, refused to accept the verdict because it was of the opinion that the verdict conflicted with the jurorsÃ¢ÂÂ answers to certain interrogatories. The jury was reinstructed, furnished with additional verdict and interrogatory forms, and directed to continue deliberations. After the jury requested further instructions on the statute of limitations and fraud, the trial court found that the jury was Ã¢ÂÂhopelessly confusedÃ¢ÂÂ and declared a mistrial, over the plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs objections. The plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs principal claim on appeal is that the trial court should have accepted the verdict and that the case should be remanded to the trial court with direction to accept the verdict.
This case differs substantially from Gold v. Newman, 211 Conn. 631, 560 A.2d 960 (1989), upon which the majority relies. In Gold, there was no jury verdict. The trial court merely declared a mistrial after it became aware of the juryÃ¢ÂÂs exposure to improper evidence. In the present case, the jury rendered a verdict. As a result, if this court concluded that the trial court should have accepted the verdict, it could reinstate the verdict and remand the case with instructions to accept and record the verdict. See State v. Avcollie, 178 Conn. 450, 471, 423 A.2d 118 (1979), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 1015, 100 S. Ct. 667, 62 L. Ed. 2d 645 (1980) (this court ordered that the jury verdict be reinstated and remanded the case to the trial court with direction to render judgment). In Gold, unlike the present case, a new trial would have been required because there was no verdict and therefore nothing to reinstate.
I concede that this case does not fall within the precise bounds of the exception to the final judgment rule set forth in State v. Curcio, 191 Conn. 27, 31, 463 A.2d 566 (1983) (Ã¢ÂÂ[a]n otherwise interlocutory order is appealable in two circumstances: (1) where the order or action terminates a separate and distinct proceed*257ing, or (2) where the order or action so concludes the rights of the parties that further proceedings cannot affect themÃ¢ÂÂ). I believe, however, that Curdo should be modified to allow an appeal in those situations in which there is a verdict upon which a judgment may be predicated.
Indeed, I discern no practical difference between our jurisdiction to hear an appeal when the court sets aside a verdict; General Statutes ÃÂ§ 52-228b; e.g., Fazio v. Brown, 209 Conn. 450, 551 A.2d 1227 (1988); Palomba v. Gray, 208 Conn. 21, 543 A.2d 1331 (1988); and when a trial court refuses to accept a verdict rendered by a jury and declares a mistrial.3 We should view our subject matter jurisdiction through the lens of the twenty-first century. To take such a narrow view of our subject matter jurisdiction, as the majority does, no.t only defies logic but burdens the parties with the enormous expense of relitigating an issue when relitigation may not be necessary.
Accordingly, I dissent.

 I agree with the majority that subject matter jurisdiction can be raised at any time, by the parties or the court. Ã¢ÂÂThe issue of subject matter jurisdiction can be raised at any time including on appeal. Once brought to the attention of the court, regardless of the form of the motion, it must be acted upon. Cahill v. Board of Education, 198 Conn. 229, 238, 502 A.2d 410 (1985). Concerned Citizens of Sterling v. Sterling, 204 Conn. 551, 556-57, 529 A.2d 666 (1987).Ã¢ÂÂ (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Gagnon v. Planning Commission, 222 Conn. 294, 297, 608 A.2d 1181 (1992).


 The jury found the issues in favor of the third defendant, Yale-New Haven Hospital.


 Footnote 17 of the majority opinion states that I suggest that the trial court should Ã¢ÂÂhave accepted the verdict and then set it aside so as to create a viable appeal.Ã¢ÂÂ Apparently, the majority reads a different dissent because my dissent does not include such a statement nor does it suggest such a charade.

Katz, J.
The dispositive issue in this appeal is whether the defendant, James J. Quinn III, is a covered person under the terms of an automobile liability insurance policy issued by the plaintiff, Middlesex Insurance Company (Middlesex), to the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs father, James J. *259Quinn, Jr.1 Following the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs judgment vacating an arbitration award of $83,333 rendered in favor of the defendant, the defendant appealed to the Appellate Court, which affirmed the judgment of the trial court. Middlesex Ins. Co. v. Quinn, 27 Conn. App. 573, 609 A.2d 1008 (1992). We granted the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs petition for certification to appeal2 to decide whether ConnecticutÃ¢ÂÂs public policy precludes an insurer from excluding from underinsured motorist coverage, a relative of the named insured who resides in the named insuredÃ¢ÂÂs household and who owns a car. We affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.
The Appellate Court opinion sets forth the following undisputed facts. Ã¢ÂÂOn February 12, 1984, while driving a car he owned, the defendant was injured in a collision in New Haven. The defendant recovered $20,000 from the tortfeasor, the full amount of liability insurance available. The defendantÃ¢ÂÂs car was insured for $100,000 bodily injury liability and $20,000 uninsured motorist coverage.
Ã¢ÂÂAt the time of the collision, the defendant lived with his father, whom [Middlesex] insured under two automobile liability policies covering five vehicles. Each of these vehicles was insured for $20,000 in uninsured motorist coverage. The defendant sought to aggregate these amounts and to collect $100,000 from [Middle-sex]. [Middlesex denied coverage on the basis that he is not a covered person as defined in the policy.3] When *260[Middlesex] . . . refused to arbitrate the dispute, the defendant sought an order compelling arbitration. The trial court, Purtill, J., issued such an order, which [the Appellate Court] subsequently upheld. See Quinn v. Middlesex Ins. Co., 16 Conn. App. 209, 547 A.2d 95, cert. denied, 209 Conn. 817, 550 A.2d 1085 (1988).
Ã¢ÂÂOn February 1,1991, the arbitration panel, in a two to one decision, awarded the defendant $83,333, with the plaintiff receiving $16,666.67 credit for the amount the tortfeasor had paid. The majority found that the policyÃ¢ÂÂs definition with respect to resident relatives [who own a car] is invalid and that the defendant is therefore a covered person under the plan. The dissent determined that the defendant is not a covered person and that our law does not require that he be covered under the circumstances of this case. On February 19, 1991, [Middlesex] moved to vacate the arbitration award. The defendant subsequently moved to confirm it. On June 7,1991, the trial court vacated the award and denied the motion to confirm.Ã¢ÂÂ Middlesex Ins. Co. v. Quinn, supra, 575. The defendant appealed to the Appellate Court, which affirmed the judgment of the trial court. Id., 583. This appeal followed.
The defendant claims that public policy precludes an automobile insurer from excluding from underinsured motorist coverage a resident family member who owns a car and that the defendant is, therefore, entitled to underinsured motorist benefits under the Middlesex policy issued to his father.* **4 The defendantÃ¢ÂÂs argument *261is based upon the principle of public policy that an insurer may not reduce its liability for underinsured motorist coverage by contract except to the extent that the relevant regulations expressly authorize. Lowrey v. Valley Forge Ins. Co., 224 Conn. 152, 156, 617 A.2d 454 (1992). Because no regulation expressly provides for exclusion from coverage of a resident of an insuredÃ¢ÂÂs household who owns a car, the defendant contends that Middlesex cannot exclude the defendant from underinsured motorist benefits. We disagree.
The Middlesex policy issued to the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs father is an automobile liability policy that provides underinsured motorist coverage, in addition to other coverage. Under the section labeled Ã¢ÂÂLiability Insurance,Ã¢ÂÂ the insurer will Ã¢ÂÂpay damages for bodily injury or property damage for which the law holds you responsible because of a car accident involving a car we insure.Ã¢ÂÂ The policy also covers Ã¢ÂÂ[ajnyone using, with your permission, a car described on the declarations page, or any additional, replacement or substitute . . . .Ã¢ÂÂ Under the section labeled Ã¢ÂÂUninsured Motorist Insurance,Ã¢ÂÂ the policy promises to Ã¢ÂÂpay the damages youÃ¢ÂÂre legally entitled to receive from the owner or operator of an uninsured motor vehicle because of bodily injury. WeÃ¢ÂÂll pay these damages for bodily injury you suffer in a car accident while occupying a car or, as a pedestrian, as a result of having been struck by an uninsured motor vehicle.Ã¢ÂÂ Additionally, the policy provides uninsured motorist benefits to Ã¢ÂÂ[ajnyone occupying, with your permission, a car we insure . . . .Ã¢ÂÂ The Ã¢ÂÂDefinitionsÃ¢ÂÂ section at the beginning of the policy, which applies to both liability and underinsured motorist insurance, states that Ã¢ÂÂYou, your and yourself . . . means *262a member of the family who is a resident of the household and who doesnÃ¢ÂÂt own a car . . . .Ã¢ÂÂ
Because the defendant owns his own automobile, he is clearly not an Ã¢ÂÂinsuredÃ¢ÂÂ under the unambiguous definition of an insured in the policy. The defendant does not argue to the contrary. 5 The defendant maintains, however, that this definition of limited coverage violates public policy. We find the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs argument unpersuasive.
Our underinsured motorist insurance statute, General Statutes ÃÂ§ 38a-336, formerly ÃÂ§ 38-175c, requires that Ã¢ÂÂ[e]ach automobile liability insurance policy shall provide insurance, herein called uninsured motorist coverage . . . for the protection of persons insured thereunder . . . .Ã¢ÂÂ (Emphasis added.)6 The accom*263panying regulation, ÃÂ§ 38a-334-6 (a) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies provides that the Ã¢ÂÂinsurer shall undertake to pay on behalf of the insured all sums which the insured shall become legally entitled to recover . . . .Ã¢ÂÂ7 (Emphasis added.)
*264Unlike the automobile liability statutes,8 the uninsured motorist statute does not require automobile insurance policies to provide underinsured motorist benefits to any particular class or group of insureds.9 See Indiana Lumbermens Mutual Ins. Co. v. Vincel, 452 N.E.2d 418, 424 (Ind. App. 1983). The legislature did not specifically define Ã¢ÂÂinsuredÃ¢ÂÂ in the context of underinsured motorist coverage. Rather, the statute requires that underinsured motorist coverage must be provided Ã¢ÂÂfor the protection of persons insured thereunder.Ã¢ÂÂ (Emphasis added.) General Statutes ÃÂ§ 38a-336 (a) (1). Thus, Ã¢ÂÂpersons insuredÃ¢ÂÂ in this statute refers to persons specified as insureds in the liability portion of the policy. There would be no violation *265of public policy, therefore, unless the insurance policy specifically were to limit underinsured motorist coverage in such a way as Ã¢ÂÂto [preclude] persons who would otherwise qualify as insureds for liability purposes.Ã¢ÂÂ Indiana Lumbermens Mutual Ins. Co. v. Vincel, supra.
If the legislature intended to mandate coverage for all resident relatives of the named insured irrespective of whether they own a vehicle, it could have expressly so provided. In the absence of clear direction from the legislature, we decline to extend public policy to require insurers to cover family members who own vehicles. Presumably, the legislature has left such coverage to be provided by the policies on the vehicles owned by those family members.
This conclusion is consistent with our previous analysis and interpretation of ÃÂ§ 38-175c, now ÃÂ§ 38a-336, in Harvey v. Travelers Indemnity Co., 188 Conn. 245, 449 A.2d 157 (1982), and Smith v. Nationwide Mutual Ins. Co., 214 Conn. 734, 573 A.2d 740 (1990). In Harvey v. Travelers Indemnity Co., supra, we held that the plaintiff, an insured under his motherÃ¢ÂÂs automobile liability policy, was entitled to underinsured motorist benefits under that policy, even though he was occupying his fatherÃ¢ÂÂs uninsured automobile when he was injured. We concluded that the public policy embodied in ÃÂ§ 38-175c directs that an insuredÃ¢ÂÂs geographical location at the time of the injury is Ã¢ÂÂirrelevant to recovery under the statutorily mandated coverage.Ã¢ÂÂ Id., 250. Underinsured motorist coverage attaches to the insured person, not the insured vehicle. Id. We held that an insurance contractÃ¢ÂÂs exclusion to the contrary violated the public policy underlying uninsured motorist coverage in Connecticut because the statute requires every automobile liability policy to provide uninsured motorist coverage for the protection of persons insured there*266under. Because the plaintiff was an insured under the liability section of his mothers policy, the policyÃ¢ÂÂs exclusion of the plaintiff from uninsured motorist benefits violated public policy.
In Smith v. Nationwide Mutual Ins. Co., supra, the plaintiff was a passenger in an automobile owned by the driver when it was involved in a one car accident. The plaintiff sought uninsured motorist benefits under a policy issued to the driverÃ¢ÂÂs father. The plaintiff argued that Ã¢ÂÂonce a policy provides liability coverage to an insured, the underinsured motorist coverage therein is coextensive with the liability coverage.Ã¢ÂÂ Id., 736. The liability coverage section of that policy provided that Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ[w]e will pay damages for bodily injury or property damage for which any covered person becomes legally responsible because of an auto accident.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ Id. A Ã¢ÂÂcovered personÃ¢ÂÂ was defined in the policy as Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂyou or any family member for the ownership, maintenance or use of any auto or trailer.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ Id. The plaintiff argued that under the terms of the driverÃ¢ÂÂs fatherÃ¢ÂÂs automobile liability policy, the driver, as a family member, was a Ã¢ÂÂcovered personÃ¢ÂÂ who became legally responsible for the plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs injuries because of an automobile accident while driving Ã¢ÂÂany auto.Ã¢ÂÂ Id., 736-37. Because the fatherÃ¢ÂÂs policy provided liability coverage to the driver while using any auto, the plaintiff argued that Ã¢ÂÂthe policy must also provide underinsured benefits to her as an occupant of that vehicle.Ã¢ÂÂ Id., 737.
We concluded that the driver was not a covered person under the liability section of his fatherÃ¢ÂÂs policy because the coverage excluded Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂany vehicle other than your covered auto which is owned by any family member.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ Id. We held that an insurer does not violate public policy by limiting liability coverage to particular *267vehicles. See General Statutes ÃÂ§ 38a-335 (a) and (d). Because the driver was not a Ã¢ÂÂcovered personÃ¢ÂÂ under the liability section of the policy, the insurer was not liable for the injuries he caused and the plaintiff could not recover damages under the policy. Moreover, the plaintiff was not a covered person within the definition provided in the uninsured motorist section of the policy because she was neither a family member nor an occupant of a covered automobile. We concluded that there was no violation of public policy because neither the plaintiff nor the driver was insured under the fatherÃ¢ÂÂs policy. Id., 737-41.
The public policy behind uninsured motorist coverage, therefore, requires an insurer to provide uninsured motorist benefits to any insured under the automobile liability policy. Ã¢ÂÂ[Ojnce an automobile liability policy is issued extending [liability] coverage to a certain class of insureds . . . uninsured motorist coverage must be offered to cover the same class of insuredsÃ¢ÂÂ; State Farm Automobile Ins. Co. v. Reaves, 292 Ala. 218, 223, 292 So. 2d 95 (1974); except as expressly excluded by statute or regulation. Streitweiser v. Middlesex Mutual Assurance Co., 219 Conn. 371, 377, 593 A.2d 498 (1991).
Other jurisdictions with statutes and regulations similar to those of Connecticut have also concluded that there is no violation of public policy if the person being denied uninsured motorist benefits is not an insured under the liability section of the policy. See, e.g., Mathis v. Auto-Owners Ins. Co., 387 So. 2d 166 (Ala. 1980); France v. Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., 380 So. 2d 1155 (Fla. App. 1980); Girrens v. Farm Bureau Mutual Ins. Co., 238 Kan. 670, 715 P.2d 389 (1986); Lewis v. American Family Ins. Group, 555 S.W.2d 579 (Ky. 1977); Robertson v. Cumis Ins. Co., 355 So. 2d 1371 (La. App.), cert. *268denied, 357 So. 2d 1153 (La. 1978); Washington v. Travelers Ins. Co., 92 Mich. App. 151, 284 N.W.2d 754 (1979); Famuliner v. Farmers Ins. Co., 619 S.W.2d 894 (Mo. App. 1981); Malo v. Aetna Casualty & Surety Co., 459 A.2d 954 (R.I. 1983); Farmers Ins. Co. v. Miller, 87 Wash. 2d 70, 549 P.2d 9 (1976).
Our analysis, however, does not end here. Although we have concluded that the denial of underinsured motorist benefits to a person who is not an insured within the definition of insured in the automobile liability section of the policy does not violate the policy embedded in ÃÂ§ 38a-336, we must also examine the definition of an insured under the policy to determine if it violates public policy. An insurer cannot limit otherwise mandated underinsured motorist coverage by labeling a forbidden exclusion as a definition. We conclude that the pertinent definition in this policy does not incorporate a forbidden exclusion and, therefore, does not violate public policy.
The legislature intended to provide that every insured within the definition of that term in the liability section of the policy is entitled to recover underinsured motorist benefits for the damages Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂhe or she would have been able to recover if the uninsured [tortfeasing] motorist had maintained a policy of liability insurance.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ Streitweiser v. Middlesex Mutual Assurance Co., supra, 377. Section 38a-336 states that uninsured motorist coverage must be provided in every automobile liability policy for Ã¢ÂÂthe protection of persons insured thereunder.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂThe policy behind linking uninsured motorist coverage to liability coverage is to reward those who obtain insurance coverage for the benefit of those they might injure. Persons who are uninsured for purposes of liability coverage should not be protected by the public policy of this state from their *269own kind.Ã¢ÂÂ Anderson v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins. Co., 471 N.E.2d 1170, 1175 (Ind. App. 1984); Indiana Lumbermens Mutual Ins. Co. v. Vincel, supra, 426.
The owner of an automobile is expected and required to obtain his or her own automobile insurance. General Statutes ÃÂ§ 14-12b (a) (1). In this case, although the defendant had insurance on his car, he elected to purchase only the minimum amount of coverage. Ã¢ÂÂObviously, [Middlesex] ... did not intend to contract with [the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs] father to provide liability coverage on automobiles in the [Quinn] household for which no premium had been paid, and the company unambiguously has made that intent part of the insurance contract.Ã¢ÂÂ Anderson v. Allstate Ins. Co., 685 F.2d 1299, 1302 (11th Cir. 1982) (interpreting Alabama law). In the absence of clear direction from the legislature, Ã¢ÂÂ[w]e decline to extend the public policy ... to allow a member of a family to purchase one liability policy and claim total coverage thereunder for the entire family while vastly increasing the risk to his or her insurer by knowingly owning and operating a fleet of uninsured [or underinsured] vehicles upon the highways.Ã¢ÂÂ France v. Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., supra, 1156. The defendant is limited to the coverage he purchased on his own automobile.
The judgment is affirmed.
In this opinion the other justices concurred.

 MiddlesexÃ¢ÂÂ application to vacate the arbitration award also named James J. Quinn, Jr., as a defendant. Only James J. Quinn III appealed. References to the defendant are to James J. Quinn III.


 Certification was granted limited to the following question: Ã¢ÂÂDoes public policy preclude an automobile insurer from excluding from uninsured motorist coverage a resident family member who owns a vehicle?Ã¢ÂÂ Middlesex Ins. Co. v. Quinn, 223 Conn. 908, 612 A.2d 56 (1992).


 The Middlesex policy issued to the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs father provides in pertinent part: Ã¢ÂÂYou, your and yourself means the person named on *260the declarations page and the personÃ¢ÂÂs husband or wife if a resident of the same household.
Ã¢ÂÂYou, your and yourself also means a member of the family who is a resident of the household and who doesnÃ¢ÂÂt own a ear or whose spouse doesnÃ¢ÂÂt own a car.Ã¢ÂÂ (Emphasis added.)


 The fatherÃ¢ÂÂs policy also included uninsured motorist coverage. Ã¢ÂÂUnder our law the statutes and regulations applicable to uninsured motorist coverage also apply to underinsured motorist coverage. . . . Because this case *261involves a claim for underinsured motorist coverage, we refer herein to that coverage.Ã¢ÂÂ Lowrey v. Valley Forge Ins. Co., 224 Conn. 152, 153 n.l, 617 A.2d 454 (1992).


 Additionally, the defendant was not occupying an automobile insured under the policy at the time of his injury. He was not entitled, therefore, to underinsured motorist benefits as an occupant of an insured automobile.


 General Statutes ÃÂ§ 38a-336, formerly ÃÂ§ 38-175c, provides: Ã¢ÂÂuninsured motorist coverage, (a) (1) Each automobile liability insurance policy shall provide insurance, herein called uninsured motorist coverage, in accordance with the regulations adopted pursuant to section 38a-334, with limits for bodily injury or death not less than those specified in subsection (a) of section 14-112, for the protection of persons insured thereunder who are legally entitled to recover damages from owners or operators of uninsured motor vehicles and underinsured motor vehicles and insured motor vehicles, the insurer of which becomes insolvent prior to payment of such damages, because of bodily injury, including death resulting therefrom. Each insurer licensed to write automobile liability insurance in this state shall provide uninsured motorists coverage with limits requested by the named insured upon payment of the appropriate premium, but the insurer shall not be required to provide such coverage with limits in excess of the limits of the bodily injury coverage of the policy issued to the named insured. No insurer shall be required to provide uninsured motorist coverage to (A) a named insured or relatives residing in his household when occupying, or struck as a pedestrian by, an uninsured or underinsured motor vehicle or a motorcycle that is owned by the named insured, or (B) to any insured occupying an uninsured or underinsured motor vehicle or motorcycle that is owned by such insured.
Ã¢ÂÂ(2) Notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary, each automobile liability insurance policy issued or renewed on and after July 1, *2631984, shall provide uninsured motorist coverage with limits for bodily injury and death equal to those purchased to protect against loss resulting from the liability imposed by law unless the insured requests in writing a lesser amount, but not less than the limits specified in subsection (a) of section 14-112. Such written request shall apply to all subsequent renewals of coverage and to all policies or endorsements which extend, change, supersede or replace an existing policy issued to the named insured, unless changed in writing by the insured.
Ã¢ÂÂ(b) An insurance company shall be obligated to make payment to its insured up to the limits of the policyÃ¢ÂÂs uninsured motorist coverage after the limits of liability under all bodily injury liability bonds or insurance policies applicable at the time of the accident have been exhausted by payment of judgments or settlements, but in no event shall the total amount of recovery from all policies, including any amount recovered under the insuredÃ¢ÂÂs uninsured motorist coverage, exceed the limits of the insuredÃ¢ÂÂs uninsured motorist coverage.
Ã¢ÂÂ(c) Each automobile liability insurance policy issued on or after October 1,1971, which contains a provision for binding arbitration shall include a provision for final determination of insurance coverage in such arbitration proceeding. With respect to any claim submitted to arbitration on or after October 1,1983, the arbitration proceeding shall be conducted by a single arbitrator if the amount in demand is forty thousand dollars or less or by a panel of three arbitrators if the amount in demand is more than forty thousand dollars.
Ã¢ÂÂ(d) For the purposes of this section, an Ã¢ÂÂunderinsured motor vehicleÃ¢ÂÂ means a motor vehicle with respect to which the sum of the limits of liability under all bodily injury liability bonds and insurance policies applicable at the time of the accident is less than the applicable limits of liability under the uninsured motorist portion of the policy against which claim is made under subsection (b) of this section.Ã¢ÂÂ


 Section 38a-334-6, formerly ÃÂ§ 38-175a-6, of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies provides in relevant part: Ã¢ÂÂminimum provision for PROTECTION AGAINST UNINSURED MOTORISTS
Ã¢ÂÂ(a) Coverage. The insurer shall undertake to pay on behalf of the insured all sums which the insured shall be legally entitled to recover as damages from the owner or operator of an uninsured motor vehicle because of bodily injury sustained by the insured caused by an accident involving the uninsured motor vehicle. This coverage shall insure the occupants of every motor *264vehicle to which the bodily injury liability coverage applies. Ã¢ÂÂUninsured motor vehicleÃ¢ÂÂ includes a motor vehicle insured against liability by an insurer that is or becomes insolvent.Ã¢ÂÂ


 Automobile liability insurers are required to provide liability coverage with respect to the insured automobile for the named insured, resident relatives of the named insured and permissive users. General Statutes ÃÂ§ 38a-335 (d); Regs., Conn. State Agencies ÃÂ§ 38a-334-5 (d).


 Section 38a-334-6 (a) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies does, however, require uninsured motorist coverage for occupants of an insured motor vehicle: Ã¢ÂÂThis coverage shall insure the occupants of every motor vehicle to which the bodily injury liability coverage applies.Ã¢ÂÂ In light of the fact that occupants of a motor vehicle would not be insured under the driverÃ¢ÂÂs policy for automobile liability, ÃÂ§ 38a-334-6 (a) requires protection for this otherwise unprotected group. Although occupants of a vehicle may have their own liability coverage, which would entitle them to uninsured motorist benefits; see Harvey v. Travelers Indemnity Co., 188 Conn. 245, 449 A.2d 157 (1982); the insurance commissioner has designated Ã¢ÂÂoccupantsÃ¢ÂÂ as a class of persons who may receive more extensive uninsured motorist coverage.
We note that the regulation does not limit uninsured motorist coverage to occupants who do not own a car. Therefore, had the defendant been an occupant of an automobile insured under the Middlesex policy, Middlesex concedes that coverage would be mandated. See footnote 5. Indeed, Middlesex argued in this court that had the defendant been an occupant of an automobile insured under its policy, to preclude the defendant from coverage on the basis of his ownership of an automobile would have been a violation of public policy as set forth in ÃÂ§ 38a-334-6 (a).

Norcott, J.
The defendant, Shelton Adams, Jr., was charged in a substitute information with the crimes of felony murder, conspiracy to commit robbery, first degree robbery and carrying a pistol without a permit in violation of General Statutes ÃÂ§ÃÂ§ 53a-54c, 53a-48, 53a-134 (a) (2) and 29-35, respectively. After a jury trial, the defendant was convicted of felony murder, first degree robbery and carrying a pistol without a permit and was acquitted on the conspiracy count.1 The *272trial court sentenced the defendant to a total effective term of fifty-five years imprisonment. The defendant appealed to this court from the judgment of conviction pursuant to General Statutes ÃÂ§ 51-199 (b). We affirm the judgment of the trial court.
The jury could reasonably have found the following facts. During the month of April, 1990, the defendant resided with his father, Shelton Adams, Sr., and his aunt in a first floor apartment of a three-family house located at 58-60 Warren Place, New Haven. On the evening of April 15, 1990, the defendant and Sherman Sims approached Nathan Roberts, who lived on the second floor of the same house, and asked him for a gun. Roberts gave the defendant a .38 caliber handgun.
At approximately 2:48 a.m. on April 16, Sims and the defendant called for a taxicab to pick them up at 1561 Chapel Street and to take them to 230 Blatchley Avenue. The Metro Taxi Company dispatched a cab operated by the victim, Allen Hansen, to respond to the call.
When the cab arrived at the Chapel Street location, both the defendant and Sims sat in the back seat with Sims seated behind the victim. As the victim drove down Blatchley Avenue, Sims ordered him to pull over behind the Columbus School. The victim complied. Sims then pulled out a gun, placed it to the victimÃ¢ÂÂs neck and fired the gun. Sims had been holding the victim with *273his left hand when he fired the gun, and consequently he suffered a bullet wound to his left pinkie finger.
Sims and the defendant exited the cab from the left, or driverÃ¢ÂÂs, side and pulled the victim from the vehicle onto the ground to allow easier access to his pockets. They then took both of the victimÃ¢ÂÂs wallets.2 The victim died almost immediately after the shooting. Powder bums found around the entry wound indicated that the gun had been held against the victimÃ¢ÂÂs skin when fired.
Sims and the defendant then walked back to the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs apartment. The defendantÃ¢ÂÂs father let the two men in and a few minutes later noticed that the defendant was wrapping SimsÃ¢ÂÂ bleeding hand. A short while later, Sims and the defendant called for another cab to take them to 28 Ellsworth Avenue, where a friend resided.
At 7:15 a.m., Roberts encountered Sims and the defendant walking toward the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs apartment. Roberts had heard about the shooting and asked the defendant if he knew anything about it. Neither the defendant nor Sims responded. Roberts then asked about the handgun that he had given to the defendant the previous night. The defendant first denied knowledge of the whereabouts of the gun, and then claimed that he had thrown it away. Roberts then noticed SimsÃ¢ÂÂ bleeding hand and asked the defendant whether he had shot the victim. In response, the defendant pointed at Sims.
Later that morning, the defendant asked his father to dispose of the handgun. The defendant, his father, and Sims were driven by a friend to the bank of the *274Mill River near East Rock Road. The defendantÃ¢ÂÂs father then threw the gun into the river.
With the assistance of the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs father, the New Haven police later retrieved the gun from the river. Ballistic tests performed on the gun established that it had fired the shot that had killed the victim. The police also conducted a search of the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs apartment in which they found a jacket identified as the one worn by the defendant on the night of the shooting. The left sleeve of the jacket was encrusted with blood that later tested to be of the same type as that of the victim.
The defendantÃ¢ÂÂs theory of defense focused on his lack of criminal intent. Through the testimony of New Haven police detective Anthony DiLullo during the stateÃ¢ÂÂs case-in-chief, the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs version of the shooting was elicited. DiLullo testified that he had met with the defendant the day after the shooting at which time the defendant had given DiLullo a voluntary statement. The defendant admitted being with Sims on the night of the homicide and being in the victimÃ¢ÂÂs cab with Sims before the shooting. The defendant was seated on the right, or passengerÃ¢ÂÂs, side of the back seat of the cab. When the cab stopped at the traffic light at the intersection of Blatchley and Grand Avenues, Sims pulled out a silver colored handgun. The defendant told DiLullo that at this point he had left the cab through the right rear door and had run away. The defendant claimed that he had never seen the gun before and that he had had no idea that Sims was planning to rob the cab driver. He also stated that he had heard a gunshot when he was approximately one and one-half blocks away from the cab.
On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly: (1) denied his motion for judgment of acquittal as there was insufficient evidence to support *275the juryÃ¢ÂÂs guilty verdict; (2) violated his constitutional due process and statutory rights by denying his request to instruct the jury on the defense of renunciation pursuant to General Statutes ÃÂ§ 53a-10; and (3) instructed the jury on consciousness of guilt and reasonable doubt so as to dilute the stateÃ¢ÂÂs burden of proof in violation of the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs constitutional due process rights. We disagree with each of these claims.
I
The defendant first claims that the trial court should have granted his motion for judgment of acquittal because the state produced insufficient evidence to sustain his conviction of felony murder, first degree robbery and carrying a pistol without a permit. He claims that the stateÃ¢ÂÂs failure to prove beyond a reasonable doubt each element of the crimes charged against him deprived him of his due process rights under the federal and state constitutions.3
*276The defendant argues that the evidence failed to establish beyond a reasonable doubt his participation in the crimes for which he was convicted. He argues that the state failed to refute his claim that he lacked knowledge of SimsÃ¢ÂÂ intentions, that he was essentially an innocent bystander, and that he fled the cab prior to the shooting. The defendant claims, therefore, that because the evidence was insufficient to preclude a reasonable hypothesis that he left the scene of the crime before the shooting, it was insufficient to find him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of the felony murder and robbery counts. The defendant also argues that there was no evidence presented at trial to support beyond a reasonable doubt the conclusion that on the day of the offense the defendant carried a pistol without a permit. We disagree.
Ã¢ÂÂIn reviewing a claim of insufficiency of the evidence, this court construes the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the juryÃ¢ÂÂs verdict and will affirm that verdict if it is reasonably supported by the evidence and the logical inferences drawn therefrom. . . . The issue is whether the cumulative effect of the evidence was sufficient to justify the verdict of guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.Ã¢ÂÂ (Citation omitted.) State v. Ruscoe, 212 Conn. 223, 245, 563 A.2d 267 (1989), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 1084, 110 S. Ct. 1144, 107 L. Ed. 2d 1049 (1990). Ã¢ÂÂWhile the jury must find every element proven beyond a reasonable doubt in order to find the *277defendant guilty of the charged offense, each of the basic and inferred facts underlying those conclusions need not be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. State v. Castonguay, 218 Conn. 486, 507, 590 A.2d 901 (1991). If it is reasonable and logical for the jury to conclude that a basic fact or an inferred fact is true, the jury is permitted to consider the fact proven and may consider it in combination with other proven facts in determining whether the cumulative effect of all the evidence proves the defendant guilty of all the elements of the crime charged beyond a reasonable doubt. State v. Grant, 219 Conn. 596, 604-605, 594 A.2d 459 (1991). . . . State v. Pinnock, 220 Conn. 765, 770-71, 601 A.2d 521 (1992).Ã¢ÂÂ (Internal quotation marks omitted.) State v. Stanley, 223 Conn. 674, 678, 613 A.2d 788 (1992). Ã¢ÂÂIn this process of review, it does not diminish the probative force of the evidence that it consists, in whole or in part, of evidence that is circumstantial rather than direct.Ã¢ÂÂ (Internal quotation marks omitted.) State v. Avis, 209 Conn. 290, 309, 551 A.2d 26 (1988), cert. denied, 489 U.S. 1097, 109 S. Ct. 1570, 103 L. Ed. 2d 937 (1989).
To convict the defendant of the crimes as charged in the substitute information, the state had to prove the following beyond a reasonable doubt. Regarding the charge of felony murder in violation of General Statutes ÃÂ§ 53a-54c, the state needed to prove that: (1) the defendant, acting alone or with another participant, committed or attempted to commit robbery; and (2) in the course of or in furtherance of the robbery, he or another participant caused the death of the victim. To convict the defendant of robbery in the first degree in violation of General Statutes ÃÂ§ 53a-134 (a) (2), the state bore the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that in the course of the commission of a robbery4 or *278immediate flight therefrom, the defendant or another participant was armed with a pistol. The charge of carrying a pistol without a permit in violation of General Statutes ÃÂ§ 29-35 required the state to prove that the defendant carried a pistol or revolver without a permit outside of his home or place of business.
Nothing in our criminal jurisprudence mandates that a jury accept a defendantÃ¢ÂÂs version of events or the reasonable inferences that flow therefrom. The jury is free to juxtapose conflicting versions of events and to determine which is the more credible. See, e.g., State v. Bunkley, 202 Conn. 629, 645, 522 A.2d 795 (1987); State v. Banks, 194 Conn. 617, 619, 484 A.2d 444 (1984). Should it determine, as it did here, that the state has proven beyond a reasonable doubt facts constituting the elements of the crimes charged, its responsibility is to return verdicts of guilty. Ã¢ÂÂWe do not sit as a thirteenth juror who may cast a vote against the verdict based upon our feeling that some doubt of guilt is shown by the cold printed record. . . . Rather, we must defer to the juryÃ¢ÂÂs assessment of the credibility of the witnesses based on its firsthand observation of their conduct, demeanor and attitude.Ã¢ÂÂ (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) State v. Henning, 220 Conn. 417, 420, 599 A.2d 1065 (1991).
Applying these standards to this case, we conclude that the evidence presented by the state could reasonably have persuaded the jury, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant was guilty of felony murder, *279first degree robbery and carrying a pistol without a permit. A review of the record reveals the following evidence in support of the convictions. The uncontroverted testimony of Roberts established that, prior to the crimes, the defendant had obtained a handgun from Roberts, for which the defendant had no permit. Through the voluntary statement given to DiLullo, the defendant himself confirmed that he had been in the cab with Sims and that he had been with Sims after the shooting. The records of the Metro Taxi Company corroborated that Sims and the defendant were together both before and after the homicide, taking cabs to and from various parts of the city. The morning following the shooting, the defendant gave a handgun to his father, who, at the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs request, threw the handgun into the Mill River. A ballistics expert testified that the bullet that had killed the victim had been discharged from the handgun that Roberts had loaned to the defendant and which the police subsequently had retrieved from the river.
Furthermore, a jacket found during a search of the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs apartment was identified by Roberts and the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs father as one worn by the defendant during the early morning hours on the day of the crime. Expert testimony concluded that blood encrusted on the left sleeve of this jacket was consistent with the unusual blood type of the victim.5 Also, testimony of investigating police officers revealed that the right rear door, through which the defendant claimed he had *280exited the cab prior to the shooting, had been locked when the victimÃ¢ÂÂs body was discovered.6
The stateÃ¢ÂÂs theory was that Sims, with a severely bleeding left hand, would have needed an accomplice to help him drag the victim from the cab and remove his wallets in order for the wallets to remain free of blood. The pooling of the victimÃ¢ÂÂs blood to the right of the front seat, a blood smear on the left rear door, the position of the victimÃ¢ÂÂs body and the vehicle when discovered, and the lack of any traces of blood on one of the victimÃ¢ÂÂs wallets, which was later recovered by the police, all supported the stateÃ¢ÂÂs theory that the defendant was present when the victim was shot, and that he aided Sims in pulling the victim from the cab and removing the victimÃ¢ÂÂs wallets.
The jury could also reasonably have inferred the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs consciousness of guilt from his statements to the police after the murder that he had never before seen the gun that killed the victim despite testimony that he had obtained it from Roberts and that he had given it to his father the morning after the shooting. Furthermore, the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs gesturing to Sims when Roberts asked him if he had shot the victim indicated the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs personal knowledge of the shooting.
The defendant argues that because this evidence did not disprove his version of the facts,7 and because it *281did not reveal that he possessed the handgun outside of his home, it was insufficient to sustain a guilty verdict. Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ[I]n viewing evidence which could yield contrary inferences, the jury is not barred from drawing those inferences consistent with guilt and is not required to draw only those inferences consistent with innocence.Ã¢ÂÂ. . State v. Grant, supra, 604. When conflicting explanations are presented, the trier is entitled to reject, as less credible, testimony and inferences offered on behalf of the defendant. State v. Roseboro, 221 Conn. 430, 437, 604 A.2d 1286 (1992). In rejecting the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs version of the surrounding events, the jury concluded that the evidence supported the stateÃ¢ÂÂs assertion that the defendant and Sims were together immediately before, during and after the robbery and shooting. Furthermore, it was reasonable for the jury to infer from the evidence that the defendant, outside of his home, possessed the handgun used in the shooting. We conclude, therefore, that the cumulative effect of the evidence was sufficient to permit the jury to find the essential elements of felony murder, first degree robbery and carrying a pistol without a permit and to persuade the jury of the existence of those elements beyond a reasonable doubt.
II
The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly denied his request to instruct the jury on the defense of renunciation pursuant to General Statutes ÃÂ§ 53a-10. He claims that the denial of this instruction violated his federal and state constitutional rights to due process and to present a defense pursuant to ÃÂ§ 53a-10.8 We disagree.
*282The defendantÃ¢ÂÂs theory of defense was that he fled the cab before Sims shot the victim and that he had no prior knowledge of SimsÃ¢ÂÂ criminal intentions when the two men entered the victimÃ¢ÂÂs cab. The state requested that the jury be charged on felony murder, which included a charge on accessorial liability under General Statutes ÃÂ§ 53a-8.9 The defendant subsequently requested that the jury be charged on the defense of renunciation under ÃÂ§ 53a-10, a defense which is only available in prosecutions based upon the conduct of another person under the provisions of ÃÂ§ 53a-8.10
The trial court granted the stateÃ¢ÂÂs request to charge on felony murder, including accessorial liability, but denied the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs request to charge on the defense of renunciation. The defendant claims that the jury should have been instructed on renunciation because evidence had been introduced that he renounced any complicity by fleeing the cab when Sims pulled out the *283gun. The defendantÃ¢ÂÂs understanding of the defense of renunciation, however, is misplaced.
Ã¢ÂÂA fundamental element of due process is the right of a defendant charged with a crime to establish a defense. ...Ã¢ÂÂ (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) (State v. Belle, 215 Conn. 257, 273, 576 A.2d 139 (1990). We have said that a defendant is entitled to have the court present instructions to the jury relating to any theory of the defense for which there is any foundation in the evidence, even if weak or incredible. Id.; State v. Fuller, 199 Conn. 273, 278, 506 A.2d 556 (1986). We must consider the evidence presented at trial in the light most favorable to supporting the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs request to charge. State v. Fuller, supra, 279. An instruction on a legally recognized theory of defense, however, is warranted only if the evidence indicates the availability of that defense. See State v. Belle, supra; State v. Fuller, supra, 278; State v. Harris, 189 Conn. 268, 274, 455 A.2d 342 (1983); State v. Rosado, 178 Conn. 704, 708, 425 A.2d 108 (1979). The trial court should not submit an issue to the jury that is unsupported by the facts in evidence. State v. Rodgers, 198 Conn. 53, 56, 502 A.2d 360 (1985).
The defendant was entitled to have the court instruct the jury on the defense of renunciation if there was any evidence to raise a reasonable doubt concerning the existence of the defense. State v. Cassino, 188 Conn. 237, 243, 449 A.2d 154 (1982). The question on appeal is whether, viewing the evidence most favorable to the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs request for charge, we perceive any evidence supporting a defense of renunciation presented at trial. Having undertaken the appropriate review, we conclude that there was no evidentiary basis to support a defense of renunciation and consequently that the court correctly refused to instruct the jury on that defense.
*284At the outset, we note that the defense of renunciation is extremely narrow. Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂRenunciationÃ¢ÂÂ generally requires not only desistance, but more active rejection, and usually contains specific subjective requirements, such as a complete and voluntary renunciation.Ã¢ÂÂ (Emphasis in original.) 1 P. Robinson, Criminal Law Defenses (1984) ÃÂ§ 81 (a), p. 347. Connecticut has patterned its criminal code after the Model Penal Code, which permits the defense only if the defendant terminates his complicity by, inter alia, wholly depriving his complicity of its effectiveness in the commission of the offense. 1 P. Robinson, supra, pp. 363-64; see General Statutes ÃÂ§ 53a-10; I A.L.I., Model Penal Code and Commentaries (1985) ÃÂ§ 2.06 (6) (c), comment, p. 326 (hereinafter A.L.I. Model Penal Code). A mere change of heart or flight from the crime scene does not establish the defense of renunciation. Rather, it is necessary that the defendant accomplice both repudiate his prior aid and deprive that aid of effectiveness. 2 W. LaFave & A. Scott, Substantive Criminal Law (1986) ÃÂ§ 6.8 (d), p. 162.
Ã¢ÂÂIf the prior aid consisted of supplying materials to be used in commission of the offense, effective withdrawal may require that these materials be reacquired so as to prevent their use by the principal.Ã¢ÂÂ Id.; see A.L.I. Model Penal Code, supra, ÃÂ§ 2.06 (6) (c), comment, p. 326. The action needed to deprive a prior action of its effectiveness will vary from case to case. Id. Indeed, it is conceivable that some actions that serve as the basis for accessorial liability are impossible to renounce given the practical constraints involved in depriving some actions of their effectiveness. Under Connecticut law, for a charge on the defense of renunciation to be warranted, there must be evidence not only that the defendant completely and voluntarily renounced his participation in the crime, but also that he did so in such *285a way as wholly to deprive or neutralize his participation of its effectiveness.
There is no evidence in the record before us that the defendant took any steps, beyond abandoning the cab, to deprive his complicity of its effectiveness. The sole theory of accessorial liability relied upon by the state was its claim that the defendant had, with the requisite intent, supplied the gun to Sims. The defendantÃ¢ÂÂs participation in the offense prior to its completion was established through the evidence indicating that he had procured the murder weapon and that he had been present when Sims held it to the victim, permitting an inference that the defendant had supplied Sims with the gun. When the act of complicity consists of providing arms, Ã¢ÂÂa statement of withdrawal ought not to be sufficient; what is important is that he get back the arms, and thus wholly deprive [the] aid of its effectiveness in the commission of the offense.Ã¢ÂÂ A.L.I. Model Penal Code, supra, ÃÂ§ 2.06 (6) (c), comment, p. 326. Depriving this act of its effectiveness would have required a further step, such as taking back the weapon, disposing of it so that it could play no role in the robbery, or warning the police so as to thwart the use of the weapon in the crime.11
A mere claim of innocence or denial of participation in the crime charged does not, without more, entitle a defendant to a theory of defense charge. State v. Cassino, supra, 242. This is particularly true regarding the defense of renunciation, pursuant to ÃÂ§ 53a-10, to a charge of accomplice liability under ÃÂ§ 53a-8.
The defendantÃ¢ÂÂs evidence did not tend to show that he had Ã¢ÂÂterminated his complicityÃ¢ÂÂ in the offenses *286charged by meeting both of the requirements of ÃÂ§ 53a-10Ã¢ÂÂi.e., (1) manifesting a complete and voluntary renunciation of criminal purpose, and (2) complete deprivation of the effectiveness of his complicity in the crimes. It tended to show only that he had no such complicity. That is a claim that he was not an accomplice under ÃÂ§ 53a-8. It is not a claim, cognizable under ÃÂ§ 53a-10, that his accomplice liability under ÃÂ§ 53a-8 had been terminated.
In other words, ÃÂ§ 53a-10, by its specific terms, recognizes a defense only to a charge of accomplice liability under ÃÂ§ 53a-8. It does not provide a general defense to a crime charged in which the state does not seek to hold the defendant criminally liable as an accomplice under ÃÂ§ 53a-8. Thus, even if the jury believed the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs version of the eventsÃ¢ÂÂnamely, that he was an innocent Ã¢ÂÂbysitterÃ¢ÂÂ who fled the cab as soon as he realized the nature of SimsÃ¢ÂÂ intentionsÃ¢ÂÂor disbelieved the stateÃ¢ÂÂs version, namely, that he supplied the gun to Sims, no instruction under ÃÂ§ 53a-10 would have been warranted. Indeed, to hold otherwise would read subdivision (1) out of ÃÂ§ 53a-10 (a) in virtually all cases.
The defendant also claims that the courtÃ¢ÂÂs failure to charge on the defense of renunciation under ÃÂ§ 53a-10 violated his statutory rights. The defendant argues that the failure of the trial court to apply a clearly relevant statute to the case before it constituted plain error. The defendantÃ¢ÂÂs claim suggests that ÃÂ§ 53a-10 provides a defendant with a right to have the jury charged on the defense of renunciation whenever a defendant is charged with liability for the acts of another person pursuant to ÃÂ§ 53a-8. Although ÃÂ§ 53a-10 affords a defense when a defendant is charged with liability for the acts of another, it in no way absolves the defendant of the responsibility of providing an evidentiary foundation for any defense on which the jury is to be instructed. See, e.g., State v. Cassino, 243; State v. *287Rosado, supra, 707-708. The defendant failed to provide such an evidentiary foundation. We conclude, therefore, that the trial court properly refused to charge the jury on the defense of renunciation.
Ill
The defendantÃ¢ÂÂs final contention is that the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs instructions to the jury regarding Ã¢ÂÂconsciousness of guiltÃ¢ÂÂ and Ã¢ÂÂreasonable doubtÃ¢ÂÂ unconstitutionally diluted the stateÃ¢ÂÂs burden of proof. At trial, the defendant objected to the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs instruction on consciousness of guilt on a basis other than the one asserted before this court. Furthermore, the defendant did not object to the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs instructions on reasonable doubt. Neither of these claims, therefore, was preserved at trial.12
Ã¢ÂÂA defendant can prevail on an unpreserved claim only if Ã¢ÂÂall of the following conditions are met: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged con*288stitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate the harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt.Ã¢ÂÂ (Emphasis in original.)

The jury was instructed that if it should find that the defendant had made false statements about himself or his whereabouts at the time of the offense it would have the right to take such misstatements as proof of the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs consciousness of his own guilt.13 This instruction was directed specifically at the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs statements to DiLullo claiming that he had never before seen the handgun used to shoot the victim.14 On appeal, *289the defendant objects to the portion of the instructions stating that Ã¢ÂÂsuch statements often tend to show a guilty connection by the accused with the crime charged.Ã¢ÂÂ (Emphasis added.) The defendant claims that this instruction diluted the stateÃ¢ÂÂs burden of proof by permitting the jury to presume that the opposite of the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs false statement had been established as an affirmative fact. We are not persuaded.
We have previously recognized that a claim challenging an instruction that mandates a particular inference adverse to the defendant may sufficiently implicate constitutional rights to satisfy the second prong of Golding. State v. Smith, 219 Conn. 160, 165, 592 A.2d 382 (1991). Ã¢ÂÂA jury charge in which the court removes from the juryÃ¢ÂÂs consideration an issue that is one of the essential elements of the crime, and thereby relieves the state of the burden of proving every element beyond a reasonable doubt, would violate the holding of Sandstrom v. Montana, 442 U.S. 510, 99 S. Ct. 2450, 61 L. Ed. 2d 39 (1979).Ã¢ÂÂ State v. Tillman, 220 Conn. 487, 503, 600 A.2d 738 (1991), cert. denied, U.S. , 112 S. Ct. 3000, 120 L. Ed. 2d 876 (1992). In the present case, however, the language Ã¢ÂÂguilty connectionÃ¢ÂÂ did not mandate that the jury find that the facts about which the defendant had made false statements were conclusively established. Rather, the instruction as a whole identified a permissive inference of consciousness of guilt that the jury might draw from the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs false statement, an item of circumstantial evidence. State v. Smith, supra; see State v. Thomas, 214 Conn. 118, 121, 570 A.2d 1123 (1990); State v. DeMatteo, 186 Conn. 696, 702, 443 A.2d 915 (1982).
Ã¢ÂÂUnpreserved nonconstitutional claims such as this Ã¢ÂÂdo not warrant special consideration simply because *290they bear a constitutional label.Ã¢ÂÂ State v. Golding, supra, 240.Ã¢ÂÂ State v. Smith, supra, 166. In reviewing a constitutionally based challenge to the courtÃ¢ÂÂs instruction to the jury, we must examine the charge as a whole to determine whether it is reasonably possible that the jury was misled by the challenged instruction. State v. Bailey, 209 Conn. 322, 338, 551 A.2d 1206 (1988). It is not reasonably possible that the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs instructions on consciousness of guilt, taken as a whole, misled the jury into shifting the burden of proof to the defendant. See State v. Brown, 199 Conn. 14, 28, 505 A.2d 690 (1986). Because the defendant failed to demonstrate that this claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging a violation of a fundamental right; State v. Golding, supra, 239-40; the defendant cannot prevail on this unpreserved claim.
The defendant also contends that the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs charge on reasonable doubt unconstitutionally diluted the stateÃ¢ÂÂs burden of proof. The defendant takes issue with the portions of the charge that stated Ã¢ÂÂ[a] reasonable doubt is a doubt for which a valid reason can be assignedÃ¢ÂÂ and Ã¢ÂÂis such a doubt as in serious affairs which concern yourselves you would pay heed.Ã¢ÂÂ15 The *291defendant argues that this language suggested that a reasonable doubt is only one that a juror can articulate and for which a juror can assign a reason.
This court has previously reviewed similar language in jury charges on reasonable doubt and has consistently rejected the proposition that such language amounts to a constitutional error. State v. Jeffrey, 220 Conn. 698, 719, 601 A.2d 993 (1991), cert. denied, U.S. , 112 S. Ct. 3041, 120 L. Ed. 2d 909 (1992); State v. Ireland, 218 Conn. 447, 457, 590 A.2d 106 (1991); State v. Thomas, supra, 119; State v. Leecan, 198 Conn. 517, 538-39, 504 A.2d 480, cert. denied, 476 U.S. 1184, 106 S. Ct. 2922, 91 L. Ed. 2d 550 (1986). When read in the context of the complete charge, these instructions did not dilute the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs presumption of innocence or reduce the stateÃ¢ÂÂs burden of proof. We conclude that the defendant has failed to demonstrate a violation of a fundamental constitutional right.
The judgment is affirmed.
In this opinion Peters, C. J., Borden and Santaniello, Js., concurred.

 The pertinent parts of the statutes under which the defendant was convicted are as follows: Ã¢ÂÂ[General Statutes] Sec. 53a-54c. felony murder. A person-is guilty of murder when, acting either alone or with one or more persons, he commits or attempts to commit robbery, burglary, kidnapping, sexual assault in the first degree, aggravated sexual assault in the first degree, sexual assault in the third degree, sexual assault in the third degree with a firearm, escape in the first degree, or escape in the second degree and, in the course of and in furtherance of such crime or of flight therefrom, he, or another participant, if any, causes the death of a person other than one of the participants, except that in any prosecution under this section, in which the defendant was not the only participant in the underlying crime, it shall be an affirmative defense that the defendant: (A) Did not commit the homicidal act or in any way solicit, request, command, importune, cause or aid the commission thereof; and (B) was not armed with a deadly weapon, or any dangerous instrument; and (C) had no reasonable ground to believe that any other participant was armed with such a weapon or instrument; and (D) had no reasonable ground to believe that any other participant intended to engage in conduct likely to result in death or serious physical injury.Ã¢ÂÂ
Ã¢ÂÂ[General Statutes] Sec. 53a-134. robbery in the first degree: class b FELONY, (a) A person is guilty of robbery in the first degree when, in the course of the commission of the crime ... or of immediate flight *272therefrom, he or another participant in the crime ... (2) is armed with a deadly weapon . . . .Ã¢ÂÂ
Ã¢ÂÂ[General Statutes] Sec. 29-35. carrying of pistol or revolver without permit prohibited, exceptions, (a) No person shall carry any pistol or revolver upon his person, except when such person is within his dwelling house or place of business, without a permit to carry the same issued as provided in section 29-28. . . .
Ã¢ÂÂ(b) The holder of a permit issued pursuant to section 29-28 shall carry such permit on his person while carrying such pistol or revolver.Ã¢ÂÂ


 According to the testimony of the victimÃ¢ÂÂs wife, her husband habitually carried two wallets, one in his front pants pocket and one in his rear pants pocket.


 The defendant claims that the insufficiency of the evidence violated his due process rights under both the federal and state constitutions. See U.S. Const., amend. XIV; Conn. Const., art. I, ÃÂ§ 8. The defendant has not presented a separate analysis for his state constitutional claims. Accordingly, we limit our analysis to the relevant federal constitutional claim. See State v. Joly, 219 Conn. 234, 258 n.16, 593 A.2d 96 (1991).
The defendant concedes in his brief that he did not preserve the insufficiency of the evidence claim regarding the count of carrying a pistol without a permit at trial by moving for judgment of acquittal on that count. He therefore claims that he is entitled to prevail on this claim under State v. Evans, 165 Conn. 61, 69-70, 327 A.2d 576 (1973), and State v. Golding, 213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989).
The United States Supreme Court held in Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 316, 99 S. Ct. 2781, 61L. Ed. 2d 560 (1979), that the fourteenth amendment commands that Ã¢ÂÂno person shall be made to suffer the onus of a criminal conviction except upon sufficient proofÃ¢ÂÂdefined as evidence necessary to convince a trier of fact beyond a reasonable doubt of the existence of every element of the offense.Ã¢ÂÂ If an appellate court is presented with an insufficiency of the evidence claim, reversal is constitutionally required if, Ã¢ÂÂafter viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, *276[no] rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.Ã¢ÂÂ Id., 319.
We believe that Jackson v. Virginia, supra, compels the conclusion that any defendant found guilty on the basis of insufficient evidence has been deprived of a constitutional right, and would therefore necessarily meet the four prongs of Golding. There being no practical significance, therefore, for engaging in a Golding analysis of an insufficiency of the evidence claim, we will review the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs challenge to his conviction on the count of carrying a pistol without a permit as we do any properly preserved claim.


 Under General Statutes ÃÂ§ 53a-133, Ã¢ÂÂ[a] person commits robbery when, in the course of committing a larceny, he uses or threatens the immediate *278use of physical force upon another person for the purpose of: (1) Preventing or overcoming resistance to the taking of the property or to the retention thereof immediately after the taking; or (2) compelling the owner of such property or another person to deliver up the property or to engage in other conduct which aids in the commission of the larceny.Ã¢ÂÂ The element that distinguishes larceny from robbery, therefore, is the use or threatened use of immediate physical force. State v. Crosswell, 223 Conn. 243, 250, 612 A.2d 1174 (1992).


 Mary Beth Gouman, a forensic expert for the state, tested the blood on the sleeve of the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs jacket to determine blood grouping types and to discover the presence of isoenzymes, a chemical substance in the blood that differs among individuals. Gouman testified that she found the blood grouping type to be Ã¢ÂÂAÃ¢ÂÂ and the isoenzyme type to be Ã¢ÂÂPGM two minus one plus,Ã¢ÂÂ both of which corresponded to the victimÃ¢ÂÂs types. She further testified that approximately two percent of the national population share this blood type.


 At trial, David Low, an expert witness regarding the locking mechanism of the victimÃ¢ÂÂs cab, a 1984 Buick LeSabre, testified that the position of the right rear door Ã¢ÂÂlock barÃ¢ÂÂ of the cab when discovered by the police rendered the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs claim that he had exited the cab through that door implausible.


 The defendant told DiLullo that he had left the cab before the shooting and that he had no knowledge of SimsÃ¢ÂÂ intention to rob the cab driver. He offered as an explanation for the presence of blood on his jacket that the victimÃ¢ÂÂs blood may have dripped onto his jacket when he was tending to SimsÃ¢ÂÂ wounded hand after the shooting. The defendant further contended that Roberts did not accurately remember when he loaned the gun to the defendant, and that there was no evidence that the defendant intentionally supplied the gun to Sims for the purpose of aiding in the robbery.


 General Statutes ÃÂ§ 53a-10 provides in relevant part: Ã¢ÂÂ(a) In any prosecution in which the criminal liability of the defendant is based upon the conduct of another person under section 53a-8, it shall be a defense that the defendant terminated his complicity prior to the commission of the *282offense under circumstances: (1) Wholly depriving it of effectiveness in the commission of the offense, and (2) manifesting a complete and voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.""


 General Statutes ÃÂ§ 53a-8 provides in relevant part: Ã¢ÂÂ(a) A person, acting with the mental state required for commission of an offense, who solicits, requests, commands, importunes or intentionally aids another person to engage in conduct which constitutes an offense shall be criminally liable for such conduct and may be prosecuted and punished as if he were the principal offender.Ã¢ÂÂ


 The defendant requested that the language of General Statutes ÃÂ§ 53a-10 be read to the jury and that the following instruction be given:
Ã¢ÂÂIn this case, evidence has been offered that when Sherman Sims pulled out a gun while he and Mr. Adams were in the taxi, Mr. Adams jumped out of the cab and ran away.
Ã¢ÂÂIf the jury accepts this evidence and finds that Mr. Adams terminated his complicity prior to the shooting of Mr. Hansen under circumstances wholly depriving any complicity on his part of any effectiveness in the commission of felony murder and that from the cab and running away Mr. Adams manifested a complete and voluntary renunciation of a criminal purpose, you must find him not guilty of felony murder.
Ã¢ÂÂWhere the defense of renunciation is raised by evidence in the case, the State has the burden of disproving such defense beyond a reasonable doubt.Ã¢ÂÂ


 We note, however, that we do not set forth in this opinion an exclusive set of possibilities for renouncing the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs aid; rather, we conclude that under these facts the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs claimed act of renunciation was legally insufficient to permit the jury to be charged on the defense.


 It is well established that to raise an objection in the trial court, counsel should state the basis of his objection in such form as he desires it to go on record. State v. Paulino, 223 Conn. 461, 476, 613 A.2d 720 (1992). Once an objection has been made and the grounds stated, a party is normally limited on appeal to raising the same objection on the same basis as stated at trial. State v. Brice, 186 Conn. 449, 457, 442 A.2d 906 (1982). To assign error in the courtÃ¢ÂÂs rulings on the Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂbasis of objections never raised at trial amounts to trial by ambuscade of the trial judge. . . .Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂId.
Before the trial court, the defendant objected to the charge on consciousness of guilt on the theory that the jury should have been told that, if it found a reasonable explanation for the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs false exculpatory statement, it was Ã¢ÂÂentitled to consider that other reason as not showing consciousness of guilt.Ã¢ÂÂ Before this court, however, the defendant challenges the use of the language Ã¢ÂÂguilty connectionÃ¢ÂÂ in the charge, claiming that it diluted the stateÃ¢ÂÂs burden of proof by suggesting that if the jury disbelieved the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs exculpatory statement, it must necessarily assume the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs guilt. Therefore, in changing the basis of his objection to the charge on consciousness of guilt, the defendant has raised an unpreserved claim.


 The full text of the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs charge on Ã¢ÂÂconsciousness of guiltÃ¢ÂÂ was as follows: Ã¢ÂÂThere is a concept in the law called consciousness of guilt. Whenever a person is on trial for a criminal offense, it is proper to show his conduct as well as any declarations made by him subsequent to the alleged criminal act. The manner in which he conducted himself when accounts by others in respect to this subject were made in his hearing may also be shown. If he should make false statements respecting himself or as to his whereabouts at the time of the affair, these may be shown, because such conduct or such statements often tend to show a guilty connection by the accused with the crime charged.
Ã¢ÂÂThe state claims in this case that the accused made false statements to Detective DiLullo pertaining to several matters. The state claims these include the accusedÃ¢ÂÂs statements [that] he had never before seen the weapon which he claims Mr. Sims had in the victimÃ¢ÂÂs taxicab. I charge you that it is your recollection of the evidence which controls in this regard. Also, I instruct you that you must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that if misstatements were made by the accused, that the accused made them or the misstatements were in order for this rule to apply. I also charge you that a misstatement of a suspect to police officers is admissible against him in a later prosecution because it permits the jury to draw the reasonable inference that the misstatement was made in attempt to avoid detection for the crime.Ã¢ÂÂ


 The defendantÃ¢ÂÂs claim at trial was that there was an innocent explanation for the false statement concerning the handgun, namely, that *289he had not admitted to seeing the handgun in order to cover for Roberts, who had given it to him.


 The full text of the courtÃ¢ÂÂs charge on reasonable doubt is set forth below: Ã¢ÂÂNow before you can render a verdict of guilty, I as I have said, the state must prove every essential element of the crime charged beyond a reasonable doubt. This phrase reasonable doubt has no technical or unusual meaning. You get the real meaning of the phrase if you emphasize the word reasonable.
Ã¢ÂÂA reasonable doubt is a doubt for which a valid reason can be assigned. It is a doubt which is something more than a guess or a surmise. A reasonable doubt is not such a doubt as raised by one who questions simply for the sake of argument. It is not a doubt suggested by the ingenuity of counsel which is not warranted by the evidence. A reasonable doubt is a real doubt, an honest doubt, a doubt which has its foundation in the evidence offered in the case or in the absence of evidence. It is such a doubt as in serious affairs which concern yourselves you would pay heed. It is such a doubt as would cause reasonable men and women to hesitate to act upon it in matters of importance.
Ã¢ÂÂAbsolute certainty in the affairs of life is almost never attainable, and the law does not require absolute certainty on the part of a jury before it *291returns a verdict of guilty. What the law does require, however, is that if after hearing all the evidence there is something in that evidence or lack of evidence which leaves in the minds of the jury as reasonable men and women a reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused, then the accused must be given the benefit of the reasonable doubt and acquitted.Ã¢ÂÂ

Berdon, J.,
dissenting. I disagree with the majorityÃ¢ÂÂs conclusion that the defendant was not entitled to an instruction on the defense of renunciation. The defendant, under the facts of this case, had a constitutional right to have the jury instructed on this defense under General Statutes ÃÂ§ EÃÂSa-lO. 1 Ã¢ÂÂA fundamental element *292of due process is the right of a defendant charged with a crime to establish a defense. Washington v. Texas, 388 U.S. 14, 19, 87 S. Ct. 1920, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1019 (1967) . . . .Ã¢ÂÂ (Citation omitted.) State v. Rouleau, 204 Conn. 240, 243, 528 A.2d 343 (1987). Ã¢ÂÂWhen the legislature has created a legally recognized defense, the defendant is entitled to a proper jury instruction on the elements of that defense so that the jury may ascertain whether the state has sustained its burden of disproving the defense beyond a reasonable doubt.Ã¢ÂÂ State v. Havican, 213 Conn. 593, 598, 569 A.2d 1089 (1990); State v. Fuller, 199 Conn. 273, 278, 506 A.2d 556 (1986). This court, sitting en banc, has unanimously held 2 that Ã¢ÂÂa defendant is entitled to have instructions presented relating to any theory of defense for which there is any foundation in the evidence, no matter how weak or incredible . . . .Ã¢ÂÂ (Internal quotation marks omitted.) State v. Belle, 215 Conn. 257, 275, 576 A.2d 139 (1990).3
*293Because renunciation is a defense, rather than an affirmative defense; State v. Rouleau, supra, 249-50 n.12; the state bears the burden of disproving the defense beyond a reasonable doubt once the issue has been raised at trial. General Statutes ÃÂ§ 53a-12. As a result, if the renunciation issue is raised by the evidence, the state must prove that the defendant did not terminate complicity prior to the commission of the offense by Ã¢ÂÂ(1) [w]holly depriving it of effectiveness in the commission of the offense, and (2) manifesting a complete and voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.Ã¢ÂÂ General Statutes ÃÂ§ 53a-10. In this case the defendant squarely raised the renunciation issue by filing an appropriate written request to charge on the defense of renunciation. He also took an exception to the courtÃ¢ÂÂs charge when it failed to instruct the jury on the issue.
I gather from the majority opinion that it is conceded that there was sufficient evidence to satisfy the second statutory requirement that the defendant manifest a Ã¢ÂÂcomplete and voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.Ã¢ÂÂ Surely, there can be no doubt that there was sufficient evidence to satisfy this requirement. Although the defendant did not take the stand, Detective DiLullo testified that the defendant had given a voluntary statement. According to DiLullo, the defendant admitted that he had been with Sims in the victimÃ¢ÂÂs cab until Sims pulled out a gun and attempted to rob the victim. Upon seeing the handgun, the defendant stated, he Ã¢ÂÂopened the door of the cab and ran away from the cab.Ã¢ÂÂ He further stated that he was approximately one and one-half blocks away from the point at which he had abandoned the cab when he heard a gunshot.
The majority holds that the renunciation instruction was not warranted in this case because the defendant failed to introduce some evidence for the first statu*294tory requirementÃ¢ÂÂnamely, evidence to show that he wholly deprived his complicity of effectiveness in the commission of the offense. The stateÃ¢ÂÂs theory was that the defendant supplied Sims with the gun that was used to murder the victim. Accordingly, the majority holds that because the defendant Ã¢ÂÂprocured the murder weapon,Ã¢ÂÂ he was required to produce some evidence that he took back the weapon, or disposed of it so that it could play no role, in order to be entitled to the instruction. I agree with the majority opinion that if the jury was required to find from the evidence that the defendant supplied or made available the gun, the renunciation instruction would have been available only if the defendant had introduced evidence that he attempted to take back the weapon or in some other manner deprived Sims of its use. The majorityÃ¢ÂÂs analysis is flawed, however, because it is predicated on the assumption that the jury was required to conclude that the defendant made the gun available to Sims. This was not the case.
The defendant was entitled to an instruction on the renunciation defense once he introduced evidence that he did not know about the gun prior to the time Sims produced it in the cab. If the defendant did not know about the gun, but only about the underlying robbery, he could terminate his complicity in the robbery and wholly deprive his complicity of effectiveness in the commission of the offense, without attempting to take back the weapon or dispose of it. Under the statute, the defendant is only required to renounce his part in the crime. Accordingly, if the defendant knew only of the robbery and not of the gun, fleeing from the car before the robbery occurred so as to terminate his part in the crime would be enough evidence justifying an instruction on renunciation.4
*295The record supplies ample evidence that the defendant did not know about the gun. DiLullo testified that the defendant stated that he had never seen the gun before, which contradicts the evidence that he supplied the gun. Surely, this was sufficient evidence to make renunciation a jury issueÃ¢ÂÂthat is, if the jury found that he did not furnish the weapon, then there was no need for the defendant to produce evidence that he attempted to take back the weapon.
In addition, the renunciation instruction should have been given in this case because there was no direct evidence that the defendant gave Sims the weapon. The evidence included the following: (1) the day before the crime, Roberts, at his apartment, gave the defendant the pistol while Sims was there; (2) the defendant and Sims left RobertÃ¢ÂÂs apartment together; (3) the morning following the shooting the defendant told Roberts that he had thrown the gun away. Surely, the jury could have inferred from this evidence that the defendant gave the gun to Sims. But they were not required to draw such an inference; State v. Price, 205 Conn. 616, 622, 534 A.2d 1196 (1987); and they could have concluded that he did not supply the gun.
Under the facts of this case and the stateÃ¢ÂÂs theory, the defendant would not be required to show that he took back the gun unless there was conclusive evidence that the defendant supplied the gun to Sims.5 Because *296that evidence could only be drawn from inferences that the jury was free to accept or reject, the defendant would have been entitled to the instruction even if he had not affirmatively introduced any evidence that he did not furnish the gun. For all we know, the jury may have found that he did not furnish the gun. Under these circumstances, the defendant would not have been obligated to get back the gun from Sims.
The majority maintains, however, that the evidence does not show that the defendant had Ã¢ÂÂterminated his complicityÃ¢ÂÂ in the offenses charged, but only that he had no such complicity. The majority therefore suggests that if the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs theory was that there was no complicity, then there was no justification for instruction on the renunciation defense because the defense is only available to one who is prosecuted for accomplice liability pursuant to General Statutes ÃÂ§ 53a-8. The record reveals, however, that the trial court clearly instructed the jury on accomplice liability in reference to the robbery charge. The court charged the jury Ã¢ÂÂas to what is called in our law, being an accessory to a crime. I refer to this doctrine with respect to the element of robbery or attempted robbery contained in the murder charge. A person is criminally liable for a criminal act if he directly commits it or if he is an accessory in the criminal act of another.Ã¢ÂÂ Thus, the jury could have predicated its finding of guilt on a finding that the defendant had been an accomplice in the commission of the robbery. Accordingly, he was entitled to an instruction on the renunciation defense.
Accordingly, I would reverse the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs conviction and remand the case for a new trial.

 General Statutes ÃÂ§ 53a-10 provides: Ã¢ÂÂ(a) In any prosecution in which the criminal liability of the defendant is based upon the conduct of another person under section 53a-8, it shall be a defense that the defendant terminated his complicity prior to the commission of the offense under circum*292stances: (1) Wholly depriving it of effectiveness in the commission of the offense, and (2) manifesting a complete and voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
Ã¢ÂÂ(b) For purposes of this section, renunciation of criminal purpose is not voluntary if it is motivated, in whole or in part, by circumstances, not present or apparent at the inception of the actorÃ¢ÂÂs course of conduct, which increase the probability of detection or apprehension or which make more difficult the accomplishment of the criminal purpose. Renunciation is not complete if it is motivated by a decision to postpone the criminal conduct until a more advantageous time or to transfer the criminal effort to another but similar objective or victim.Ã¢ÂÂ


 Although there was a concurring opinion expressing disagreement with a portion of the majority opinion, the seven person court, which included Chief Justice Peters and Justice Santaniello, unanimously agreed that the defendant is entitled to a jury instruction on a defense for which there is any foundation in the evidence. State v. Belle, 215 Conn. 257, 275, 576 A.2d 139 (1990).


 Our standard of review is clear: Ã¢ÂÂWhen we are reviewing a trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs failure to charge as requested, we must adopt the version of the facts most favorable to the defendant which the evidence would reasonably support.Ã¢ÂÂ (Internal quotation marks omitted.) State v. Havican, 213 Conn. 593, 595, 569 A.2d 1089 (1990); see State v. Rouleau, 204 Conn. 240, 250, 528 A.2d 343 (1987) (Ã¢ÂÂ[wjhether the defense . . . was Ã¢ÂÂraisedÃ¢ÂÂ at the trial must be determined by viewing the record in a light most favorable to the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs claimÃ¢ÂÂ).


 Ã¢ÂÂThe general principle advanced is that the accomplice must deprive his prior action of its effectiveness. The action needed for that purpose will, *295of course, vary with the accessorial behavior. If the behavior consisted of aid, as by providing arms, a statement of withdrawal ought not to be sufficient; what is important is that he get back the arms, and thus wholly deprive his aid of its effectiveness in the commission of the offense. If, on the other hand, complicity inhered in request or encouragement, countermanding disapproval may suffice to nullify its influence, providing it is heard in time to allow reconsideration by those planning to commit the crime.Ã¢ÂÂ I A.L.I., Model Penal Code and Commentaries (1985) ÃÂ§ 2.06 (6) (c), comment, p. 326, and cases cited therein.


 For example, if the defendant had testified and judicially admitted that he furnished the gun used in the crime.

BISHOP, J., Dissenting.
I dissent. Borrowing the words from State v. Donaldson, (1889) 41 Minn. 74 [42 N. W. 781], the question before us is Ã¢ÂÂ""Whether the term Ã¢ÂÂpatent and proprietary medicinesÃ¢ÂÂ is to be understood in a strict and technical sense as limited to those in the preparation of which there is an exclusive right of property in some proprietor ... or whether it is used in a popular and more extended sense, as including all preparations prepared and o sold throughout the country in original packages, as patent medicines are.Ã¢ÂÂ I am persuaded that our statute uses the *760term in the popular and more extended sense, because (see State v. Donaldson, supra) some thirty states have statutes so similar to ours that it is evident they are cut by a common pattern, and in the following cases the validity of the statutes has been weighed with Ã¢ÂÂproprietary medicinesÃ¢ÂÂ in the scale, employed not in the technical but in the popular sense: State v. Donaldson, supra, Tiedje v. Haney, (1931) 184 Minn. 569 [239 N. W. 611], Noel v. People, (1900) 187 Ill. 587 [58 N. E. 616, 79 Am. St. Rep. 238, 52 L. R. A. 287], Kentucky Board of Pharmacy v. Cassidy, (1903) 115 Ky. 690 [74 S. W. 730], State v. Wood, (1927) 51 S. D. 485 [215 N. W. 487, 54 A. L. R. 719], and State v. Childs, (1927) 32 Ariz. 222 [257 Pac. 366, 54 A. L. R. 736],
Had I any doubt as to the meaning properly to be given the term as it appears in this penal statute, I would resolve the doubt in favor of that construction which did not bring it within the statute. The English language is so rich in words that the legislature can easily define a crime and a person should not be held to be a lawbreaker on doubtful interpretation. Here, to my mind, both the doubt and the most acceptable interpretation bring us to the same result. I am of the opinion the judgment should be reversed.

SHAW, P. J.
By count I of the complaint the defendant was charged with violation of section 367d of the Penal Code, which provides that Ã¢ÂÂany person operating or driving an automobile, motorcycle or other motor vehicle who becomes or is intoxicated while so engaged in operating or driving such automobile, motorcycle or other motor vehicle shall-be guilty of a misdemeanor.Ã¢ÂÂ This section was adopted in 1911 and has not since been amended.
In 1913 an act designated as the Ã¢ÂÂmotor vehicle actÃ¢ÂÂ was passed, section 17 of which provided that Ã¢ÂÂno intoxicated *Supp. 777person shall operate or drive a motor or other vehicle upon any public highway within this state.Ã¢ÂÂ (Stats. 1913, p. 646.) In 1915 this act was repealed, and another act designated as the Ã¢ÂÂVehicle ActÃ¢ÂÂ was passed, which contained a section 17 identical with that just quoted from the act of 1913. (Stats. 1915, p. 406.) Section 17 of the act of 1915 was amended in 1917. (Stats. 1917, p. 400.) By these acts the violation of the provisions referred to was made a misdemeanor. In 1919 section 17 of the act of 1915 was again amended to provide that Ã¢ÂÂno person who is under the influence of intoxicating liquor . . . shall operate or drive a motor or other vehicle on any public highway within this stateÃ¢ÂÂ, and to make a violation of this provision punishable by either a fine or imprisonment in the county jail or the state prison. (Stats. 1919, p."" 214.) In 1923 the act of 1915 and its amendments were repealed and a new act known as the Ã¢ÂÂCalifornia Vehicle ActÃ¢ÂÂ was passed. (Stats. 1923, p. 517.) Section 112 of this act was substantially the same as the 1919 amendment of section 17 of the act of 1915, both as to substance and penalty. In 1929 the prohibitory provision of section 112 of this act was amended to read in part, Ã¢ÂÂIt shall be unlawful for any person . . . who is under the influence of intoxicating liquor ... to drive a vehicle on any public highway within this stateÃ¢ÂÂ, and the penalty was left as before, that is, either fine or imprisonment in county jail or state prison. (Stats. 1929, p. 537.) No further amendments have been made.
Thus it appears that all these provisions of the various vehicle acts are subsequent in point of time to section 367d of the Penal Code. It is also obvious that the former overlap the latter, both sets of provisions covering the driving of a motor vehicle on a public highway. The Penal Code section makes it unlawful for any person doing such driving to be intoxicated while doing so, and the present provision of the California Vehicle Act, like its immediate predecessors, makes it unlawful for any' person who is under the influence of intoxicating liquor to do such driving. The phrase, Ã¢ÂÂunder the influence of intoxicating liquorÃ¢ÂÂ, as used in the vehicle acts, is synonymous with the word Ã¢ÂÂintoxicatedÃ¢ÂÂ used in the Penal Code section. (See People v. Dingle, 56 Cal. App. 445, 452, 453 [205 Pac. 705]; People v. Ekstromer, 71 Cal. App. 239, 244, 245 [235 Pac. 69]; People v. McKee, 80 Cal. App. 200, 205 [251 Pac. 675].) *Supp. 778There is no substantial difference between these two provisions. The fact that one of them makes it unlawful for an intoxicated person to drive, while the other forbids a driver to be intoxicated, affords no basis for any distinction between them. By both of them the concurrence of intoxication with the driving of a motor vehicle on a public highway makes out the offense.
In view of what we have just said, certain well-established rules make it clear that section 367d of the Penal Code can no longer be regarded as in force except in regard to offenses not covered by the vehicle acts, such as the driving of a motor vehicle on private ground by one who is intoxicated.  Where two legislative enactments punish exactly the same act they are in conflict. (People v. Schuster, 122 Cal. App. (Supp.) 790, 793 [10 Pac. (2d) 204]; Ex parte Stephen, 114 Cal. 278, 282 [46 Pac. 86]; In re Murphy, 190 Cal. 286, 290 [212 Pac. 30]; In re Mingo, 190 Cal. 769, 771 [214 Pac. 850].) Where two statutory provisions are in irreconcilable conflict, the one latest in point of time will control. (Beneficial Loan Soc., Ltd., v. Haight, 215 Cal. 506, 512 [11 Pac. (2d) 857]; Crooks v. PeopleÃ¢ÂÂs Finance & Thrift Co., 111 Cal. App. (Supp.) 769, 773 [292 Pac. 1065]; People v. Schuster, supra.) A later statute prescribing a different punishment for an offense works a repeal of' the former one by implication. (People v. Tisdale, 57 Cal. 104.)
This question appears never to have received consideration from any of the higher courts of this state. In People v. Collins, 195 Cal. 325, 344 et seq. [233 Pac. 97], People v. Lloyd, 97 Cal. App. 664, 670 [275 Pac. 1010], and People v. Aguilar, 140 Cal. App. 87 [35 Pac. (2d) 137, 141], reference was made to the Penal Code section and to one or more of the vehicle act sections above cited, but no opinion was expressed regarding their effect on each other. In re Quitman, 116 Cal. App. 59 [2 Pac. (2d) 41], held, on habeas corpus, that a commitment issued under section 367d of the Penal Code, presumably in 1931, that being the year of the decision, was valid. However, the opinion makes no reference to section 112 of the vehicle act, nor does it show that the question now before us was either raised or considered. For all that appears the complaint on which the commitment there was based may have charged some offense committed on private property and therefore still within *Supp. 779the reach of section 367d. We cannot regard that ease as authority against our conclusion.
The complaint in the present case does not show whether the offense charged occurred on a public highway. The great majority of such offenses are committed there, and we do not think the provision of the vehicle act should be regarded as a mere exception to the Penal Code section, so as to uphold a complaint which does not state the place of the offense and cast on the defendant the burden of proving that his acts occurred on a public highway. The tail should not be expected so to wag the dog. Moreover, the evidence shows that the acts complained of in this case did occur on a public highway and hence could be prosecuted only under the vehicle act.
 The complaint does not charge an offense under that act, and if we could overlook this deficiency, in view of the sufficiency of the evidence to prove such an offense, we would be confronted with the difficulty that by reason of the imprisonment in the state prison which is a possible penalty for violation of section 112, every such violation stands as a felony for every purpose up to judgment and must be prosecuted as a felony. (People v. War, 20 Cal. 117, 120; People v. Collins, 195 Cal. 325, 347 [233 Pac. 97]; Doble v. Superior Court, 197 Cal. 556, 577 [241 Pac. 852]; Morris v. Moore, 61 Cal. App. 314, 320 [214 Pac. 995].) Consequently this offense cannot be prosecuted in the municipal court, which has no felony jurisdiction, but is limited in criminal cases to misdemeanors.
The charge in count II is a violation of section 121, of the vehicle act, commonly called reckless driving. We have examined the evidence, and while it is conflicting, that given in behalf of the prosecution, with the possible inferences therefrom, is sufficient to uphold the verdict on this count.
The judgment on count I is reversed and the cause is remanded to the municipal court with directions to dismiss said count. The judgment on count II is modified by striking therefrom the provision that Ã¢ÂÂsentence on count II to commence upon the expiration of sentence imposed this day on count IÃ¢ÂÂ and as so modified it is affirmed.

Defendants severally appeal from judgments of conviction of violation of section 2 of Ordinance No. 71,485 of the city of Los Angeles, contending, among other thing's, that such ordinance is violative of con*Supp. 765stitutional limitations and beyond the power of a municipality to make or enforce.
Such ordinance declares it to Ã¢ÂÂbe unlawful for any owner to operate or cause to be operated, any interurban stage without first having obtained (from the Board of Public Utilities and Transportation of the City of Los Angeles) a permit in writing ... so to doÃ¢ÂÂ. The term Ã¢ÂÂinterurban stageÃ¢ÂÂ is so defined as to include motor carriers of either persons or property who use the streets of Los Angeles in carrying on a public transportation business between points one or more of which are within, and one or more without, the limits of said city. Before a permit is issued it requires that the owner file with the board, and thereafter keep in full force and effect, Ã¢ÂÂa bond or policy of insurance in such form as said board may deem proper . . . insuring the public against loss by reason of damage that may result to any person or property from the operation ofÃ¢ÂÂ his interurban vehicles and a further bond in the sum of $2,500 Ã¢ÂÂpayable to the Board . . . for the use and benefit of any interested person ... Ã¢ÂÂ, conditioned upon the prompt payment to the shipper of collections made on C. O. D. shipments.
We think that such matters so attempted to be regulated by the ordinance are not local or municipal. The regulations imposed are not upon the use of the city streets as is contended, but upon the conduct of a business irrespective of the use of streets, except as, such use is incidental to entry into or departure from the city in the carrying on of the business sought to be regulated; the bonds required are not limited for the protection of pedestrians, property owners, or shippers within, or shipments or collections originating or terminating within the corporate limits of the city of Los Angeles. The bonds so required would apply alike to business of the carrier throughout the state or elsewhere. Ã¢ÂÂWhile the use of the streets may be regulated the city has no power to convert them into toll roads and thus exact tribute from those who in the conduct of business elsewhere have occasion to use them solely as highways.Ã¢ÂÂ (In re Smith, 33 Cal. App. 161, 164 [164 Pac. 618].)
The provision in section 23, article XII, of the Constitution for the reservation in municipal councils, until a vote to the contrary by the electors, of Ã¢ÂÂsuch powers of *Supp. 766control over public utilities as relate to the making and enforcement of local, police, sanitary and other regulations, other than the fixing of rates, vested in any city ... as, at an election to be held pursuant to law, a majority of the qualified electors of such city . . . , voting thereon, shall vote to retainÃ¢ÂÂ is obviously not creative in the governing boards of municipalities of powers any greater than those theretofore possessed by them relative to the control of public utilities. Said section 23 provides generally that: Ã¢ÂÂThe railroad commission shall have and exercise such power and jurisdiction to supervise and regulate public utilities, in the state of California, ... as shall be conferred upon it by the legislature, and the right of the legislature to confer powers upon the railroad commission respecting public utilities is hereby declared to be plenary and to be unlimited by any provision of this Constitution. From and after the passage by the legislature of laws conferring powers upon the railroad commission respecting public utilities, all powers respecting such public utilities vested in . . . municipal councils, or other governing bodies of the several . . . cities . . . shall cease so far as such powers shall conflict with the powers so conferred upon the railroad commission; provided, however, that this section shall not affectÃ¢ÂÂ the reservation hereinabove noted, to-wit, Ã¢ÂÂpowers of controlÃ¢ÂÂ of a Ã¢ÂÂlocalÃ¢ÂÂ nature which were then and had been theretofore Ã¢ÂÂvested in any city and county or incorporated city or townÃ¢ÂÂ.
By the enactment of the so-called Auto Stage and Truck Transportation Act (Stats. 1917, p. 330; DeeringÃ¢ÂÂs Gen. Laws, 1931, vol. 2, p. 2534) the railroad commission was expressly Ã¢ÂÂvested with power and authority to supervise and regulate every transportation company in this state; ... to regulate the accounts, service and safety of operations of each such transportation company; . . . and to supervise and regulate transportation companies in all other matters affecting the relationship between such companies and the traveling and shipping publicÃ¢ÂÂ. (Sec. 4, above cited act.) The term Ã¢ÂÂtransportation companyÃ¢ÂÂ as used therein is defined to include public carriers of property by auto truck over regular routes not exclusively within a single city. The defendants come within this definition. It may be remarked, however, that our conclusions- would be *Supp. 767the same if the defendants were a public carrier of passengers as by section 2ÃÂ¼ of the Public Utilities Act (Act 6386, DeeringÃ¢ÂÂs Gen. Laws, 1931, vol. 2, p. 3523) public carriers of passengers, for compensation, over regular routes, are declared to be common carriers and by subdivision dd, section 2, every common carrier is included within the definition of Ã¢ÂÂpublic utilityÃ¢ÂÂ and hence made subject to the powers of the commission as stated generally throughout that act and with particularity as to Ã¢ÂÂpassenger stage corporationsÃ¢ÂÂ in section 50ÃÂ¼ thereof.
Thus it appears that the legislature has acted pursuant to the right given it by said section 23 of article XII of the Constitution, and has conferred upon the railroad commission full jurisdiction over common carriers of passengers and property. The city of Los Angeles, therefore, had no right to pass, and has no power to enforce, the ordinance in question, unless the Ã¢ÂÂregulationÃ¢ÂÂ thereof be Ã¢ÂÂlocalÃ¢ÂÂ and the power thereunto be Ã¢ÂÂvestedÃ¢ÂÂ. As heretofore suggested, we think that the subject of the legislation in this case was not local and that the city never possessed the power of statewide regulation of a transportation business whose use of the streets of the city of Los Angeles, like those of every municipality through which its vehicles passed, was merely incidental to the carrying on of a business which by definition of the ordinance itself is exclusively nonlocal.
It might also be mentioned that even if this ordinance could be otherwise sustained it apparently would have to fall as obnoxious to the provisions of section 21, article I of the Constitution. Its regulatory provisions are made applicable only to those transportation companies Ã¢ÂÂwhich operate between points, stations or depots, one or more of which are within and one or more of which are without said city; and which do not, on the same continuous run, receive and discharge passengers or freight within said cityÃ¢ÂÂ. For the type of regulation attempted by this ordinance we see no reasonable ground for such discrimination. The ordinance, therefore, is void for reasons similar to those expressed in In re Blois, 179 Cal. 291 [176 Pac. 449].
The judgments are reversed and the causes united in this appeal are remanded to the municipal court, which is directed to dismiss the actions.

Defendant was engaged in the business of purchasing walnuts, cracking them, extracting *Supp. 764the meats, discarding the shells, cleaning, airblowing, brushing, sorting and grading such meats, in certain grades washing and drying them, and then offering for sale the product so produced. It required about a day and a half of labor for one man to produce 25 to 30 pounds of meats ready for sale and the cost of the processing was from 7 cents to 10 cents on each pound. The defendant admittedly bought some walnuts for which he did not pay the full price cash on delivery. The case was submitted upon stipulated facts and uncontradicted testimony of the defendant who was found guilty of acting as a Ã¢ÂÂdealerÃ¢ÂÂ without a license in violation of section 1261, Agricultural Code as amended in 1933, Statutes of 1933, chapter 25, page 274.
Such section defines the ""term Ã¢ÂÂdealerÃ¢ÂÂ as meaning Ã¢ÂÂany person other than a commission merchant who for the purpose of resale at wholesale obtains from the producer thereof possession or control of any farm product except by payment to the producer, at the time of obtaining such possession or control, of the full agreed price of such commodity in lawful money of the United States ...Ã¢ÂÂ
We think that the evidence, hereinabove epitomized, fails to establish that defendant acted as a Ã¢ÂÂdealerÃ¢ÂÂ within the definition above quoted. The defendant bought walnuts not to resell as such upon a turn in the market but to provide himself with material which he himself used in carrying on a business which, by virtue of separating the material bought, discarding a portion of it (the shells) and applying skilled labor and certain natural elements (air and water) to the remaining portion (the meats), enabled him to offer for original saleÃ¢ÂÂnot resaleÃ¢ÂÂa product as different upon principle from that which he had purchased as would be the cabinet produced by a skilled artisan from lumber acquired in the rough. A cabinet maker would hardly be called a lumber dealer.
In Chattanooga Plow Co. v. Hays, 125 Tenn. 148 [140 S. W. 1068], quoted in Phillips v. Byers, 189 Cal. 665, 670 [209 Pac. 557], it is said:
Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂThe marked distinction between a manufacturer and a merchant is that the merchant, or dealer, sells to earn a profit, and the manufacturer sells to take profit already earned. He must buy the materials out of which to make his finished product, and he must sell the product of his factory after it is finished. But such dealings are not his occupation. The one *Supp. 765supplies him with materials with which to pursue it, while the other merely enables him to take the profit earned. Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ
In the case of Phillips v. Byers, supra, a corporation which purchased raw fruits and vegetables, canned and then sold them to wholesalers, was held to be a manufacturer, not a merchant or dealer. In Norris Brothers v. Commonwealth, 27 Pa. (3 Casey) 494, 495, we find this statement: Ã¢ÂÂA dealer ... is not one who buys to keep, or makes to sell, but one who buys to sell again. He . . . depends for his profit, not upon the labor he bestows on his commodities, but upon the skill and foresight with which he watches the'markets.Ã¢ÂÂ The case of State v. Chickasaw Wood Products Co., 169 La. 1179 [126 So. 914, 916], quotes from WebsterÃ¢ÂÂs New International Dictionary defining the word Ã¢ÂÂdealerÃ¢ÂÂ in part as Ã¢ÂÂa person who makes a business of buying and selling goods, as distinguished from a manufacturer, without altering their conditionÃ¢ÂÂ.
In State v. Chadbourn, 80 N. C. (Kenan) 437 [30 Am. Rep. 94], in holding that one who bought timber and converted it into lumber for sale was a manufacturer rather than a Ã¢ÂÂmerchantÃ¢ÂÂ or Ã¢ÂÂtraderÃ¢ÂÂ, the Supreme Court of North Carolina said, respecting the business of a Ã¢ÂÂtraderÃ¢ÂÂ:
Ã¢ÂÂ1 The goods are sold substantially in the form in which they are bought, and the difference between the sums paid and received constitutes the profit of the business. The defendantsÃ¢ÂÂ occupation does not answer this definition. They are rather manufacturers who by skill and labor convert what they get into another and more valuable form of property. The manufacturer of shoes purchases the leather and other materials from which they are made, and then sells them at a large advance. He both buys and sells, but he is not a trader. So with the defendants who purchase the tree or log and dispose of the lumber and boards which are made from it. They do not buy and sell the same article in an unchanged condition. The manufacturing process intervenes, and this gives name and character to their pursuit.Ã¢ÂÂ To the same effect is the decision in State v. Yearby, 82 N. C. (Kenan) 486 [33 Am. Rep. 694], regarding the business of a butcher.

JOHNSON, P. J.
The question in this case is whether in an action in the municipal court by a trustee in bankruptcy, to recover the value of certain personal property alleged as part of the bankruptÃ¢ÂÂs estate to have been converted by the defendant, the finding of the value of the property at a hearing before the referee in bankruptcy became res judicata and conclusive in the proceeding in the municipal court.
The defendant, who had originally been the owner of the Lafayette Grill, sold the restaurant and its equipment to James X. Psaltes in March, 1932, taking as security for payment of the purchase money a chattel mortgage of the personal property. Psaltes having made default in payment, the defendant foreclosed the chattel mortgage and bought the mortgaged property at the sale. He then, on' April 3, 1933, took possession of the premises and of all the personal property therein, including allegedly certain groceries and other articles not described in the mortgage. After so taking possession defendant surrendered possession of the premises to the landlord, and transferred to him all the personal property therein -in consideration of the release of defendant from the obligations of the lease of the premises.
Thereafter on May 3, 1933, Psaltes filed a voluntary petition in bankruptcy, and after proceedings duly had he was adjudged a bankrupt; and at the first meeting of creditors plaintiff was elected trustee and in due time qualified as such.
On or about July 12th the trustee filed with the referee a petition for an order requiring this defendant to propound his claim to certain personal property, of stated values, as set forth in the petition, alleged to be assets of the bankruptÃ¢ÂÂs estate of which the defendant had taken possession, *Supp. 771and which upon demand of the trustee defendant had failed to surrender.
By a verified claim dated August 24th defendant made claim to ownership of all the property mentioned in the trusteeÃ¢ÂÂs petition except an exhaust fan, a radio and a lot of groceries. The trustee by filing objections joined issue as to ownership in defendant; and in due course the matter came on for hearing by the referee, both parties being pr.esent with their respective attorneys. After considering the evidence presented and briefs filed by the attorneys,- the referee in an opinion filed May 9, 1934, recited the facts as shown by the evidence, and reached the conclusion that under the law the trustee was entitled to an order sustaining his objections to the allowance of defendantÃ¢ÂÂs claim, and that title to the disputed articles was vested in the trustee. Accordingly, by an order dated May 24, 1934, the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs claim was disallowed, and it was adjudged that the trustee was vested with title to the property in dispute, the value of which was set opposite each article, and also to the articles of which defendant made disclaimer, valued at $535. The total value fixed by the referee was $1746.48.
No application for a review of the refereeÃ¢ÂÂs order was made by defendant, and for the purpose of enforcing the order, the trustee instituted his action in the municipal court on June 21, 1934, praying for judgment for $1746.48 with interest.
From an examination of the transcript of the proceedings in the lower court, the controversy between the parties does not appear to have been over the valuations of the referee, except in regard to the lot of groceries. The referee, acting upon the testimony of the bankrupt and certain of his employees, fixed the value of the groceries at $200, while defendant, in contradiction of all the witnesses, insisted that there had been no groceries on hand when he took possession.  DefendantÃ¢ÂÂs real opposition to the trusteeÃ¢ÂÂs claim in the lower court centered upon defendantÃ¢ÂÂs conten-Ã¢ÂÂ tion that there had been no conversion. This contention was based on an assertion that though defendant had transferred all the property to the landlord in consideration of defendantÃ¢ÂÂs release from the obligations of the lease, it devolved upon the trustee to pursue the landlord, and not *Supp. 772defendant, for recovery of the property or its value. There can be no question, however, that when in substance defendant sold the property to the landlord for a valuable consideration received by defendant, he was exercising dominion over the property, and was guilty of conversion.
That question was adjudicated by the referee in favor of the trustee after a full hearing in which the defendant participated; and we entertain no doubt that defendant became bound on that issue by the refereeÃ¢ÂÂs order. (See In re Faerstein, 58 Fed. (2d) 942, and cases there cited.)
No written findings were made in the municipal court, but instead of accepting the refereeÃ¢ÂÂs valuations as an adjudicated fact, the court, though holding the trustee entitled to a recovery, gave judgment for only $300 and costs. There is nothing in the record to explain this figure, as no evidence was introduced other than the values set forth in the refereeÃ¢ÂÂs opinion and order.
The trustee having appealed from the judgment rendered, the question now before us is as to the binding effect of the refereeÃ¢ÂÂs order. In other words, does the rule of res judicata apply to the refereeÃ¢ÂÂs determination both as to conversion and as to the value of the property affected by his order ?
Section 1 of the Bankruptcy Act in subdivision (7) states: Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂcourtÃ¢ÂÂ shall mean the court of bankruptcy in which the proceedings are pending, and may include the refereeÃ¢ÂÂ. In MacDonald v. Plymouth County Trust Co., 286 U. S. 263 [52 Sup. Ct. 505, 76 L. Ed. 1093], the court had occasion to consider the status of the referee in connection with section 23 (b) as originally enacted and incorporated in 11 U. S. C. A., section 46 (b). That section provides that suits by trustees shall be brought or prosecuted only in courts where, except for the bankruptcy, the bankrupt might have brought or prosecuted them, unless by consent of the proposed defendant. In the case above cited, there was a hearing by consent before the referee upon the trusteeÃ¢ÂÂs petition to set aside certain transfers as voidable preferences. Drawing a distinction between the power of the referee to decide the issues in such a suit brought before him without objection, and the power to compel the litigation of them before him over objection of the proposed defendant, the court, said that although it had never before definitely decided that question, *Supp. 773it could perceive no reason why the privilege of procedure in a plenary suit could not he waived by consent. And declaring the referee to be vested with the powers of a court of bankruptcy to decide the issues in such a suit presented to him without objection, the court said (p. 268) :
Ã¢ÂÂWhile under the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act the exercise of his jurisdiction by the referee is ordinarily restricted to those matters which may be dealt with summarily by the method of procedure available to referees in bankruptcy, the restriction may be removed, as it was here, by consent of the parties to a summary trial of the issues presented. The referee therefore had power to decide the issues, and the court of appeals below should have considered the appeal on the merits."" (See, also, McCulloch v. Davenport Sav. Bank, 226 Fed. 309, 311.)
In Breit v. Moore, 220 Fed. 97 (9th Cir.), affirming the decision of Judge Booling in Moore v. Breit, 211 Fed. 687, where the trustee, Moore, to enforce a ruling of the referee in his favor, brought suit in the district court, and had judgment on the pleadings, in an action against Breit to recover the sum of $250 as the amount of a voidable preference, the court of appeals, speaking through Judge Ross, said (220 Fed. 99) :
Ã¢ÂÂNo review of the foregoing findings, conclusions or judgment was sought. Becoming final, and Breit refusing to return the money so received by him as a preference, the trustee brought this suit thereon in the court below to recover the account. The answer of Breit containing no denial of the judgment or of any of the proceedings on which it was based, the court below rightly gave the complainant judgment on the pleadings. Breit was no stranger to the proceedings before the referee. On the contrary, he presented his claim, contested the preference alleged to have been received by himÃ¢ÂÂintroducing proof in behalf of his contentionÃ¢ÂÂand then abided by the findings and decision against him. He thus had a trial before a competent officer of his own selection of the issue he now claims the right to have tried by a jury. The conclusive answer is that he is concluded by the adverse decision of the referee in which he acquiesced.Ã¢ÂÂ
So in this ease no review of the refereeÃ¢ÂÂs order was sought by the defendant; and he abided by the refereeÃ¢ÂÂs decision. *Supp. 774Having once been heard in the court of the referee, who by defendantÃ¢ÂÂs consent had jurisdiction to determine the controversy, defendant was concluded by the adverse decision of the referee, and had no right to litigate the same issues anew in the municipal court. Without protesting against the jurisdiction of the referee, defendant, expressly submitted his claim to that court, and when after a full hearing the ruling was made against him, he acquiesced until the trustee sought, as in the Moore case, to enforce the judgment of the referee in an appropriate action.
For further discussion of the subject reference may be made to Henderson v. Denious, 186 Fed. 100, 105; Hargadine etc. Co. v. Hudson, 122 Fed. 232; McCulloch v. Davenport Sav. Bank, 226 Fed. 309, 312-315, containing quotations from several earlier cases; and Bachman v. McCluer, 63 Fed. (2d) 580, 583, citing numerous cases.
In view of the finality of the refereeÃ¢ÂÂs order, as established by the well-settled rule governing such matters, it must be held that plaintiff was entitled in his action in the municipal court to a judgment for the aggregate value of the property in question as fixed by the referee, namely, $1746.48, with interest, as provided in section 3336 of the Civil Code, from March 23, 1933, the date of conversion.
The judgment i's therefore reversed, and the cause remanded to the municipal court with directions to enter judgment in favor of plaintiff and against defendant in conformity with the views above expressed.

JOHNSON, P. J.
This case gives rise to the question whether a warehouseman may have a general lien, not only for charges for storage and ordinary services and expenditures incident to the business, but also for money advanced, in the case of liquors, for taxes, payable by the owner under the internal revenue laws. The determination of that question depends on the interpretation to be given to sections 27 and 28 of the Uniform Warehouse Receipts Act of this state. (See 3 DeeringÃ¢ÂÂs General Laws, 1931 ed., p. 4975, Act 9059, and amendment of 1933, Stats. 1933, p. 2398.)
There is no dispute concerning the facts of the ease. Beginning in the year 1933 Western Distillers Corporation had at various' times stored liquors in defendantÃ¢ÂÂs warehouses, and on January 18, 1935, there was issued to that corporation by defendant a nonnegotiable warehouse receipt for 20 barrels of rye whiskey then in one of defendantÃ¢ÂÂs warehouses.
The receipt, among other things, stated that the warehouseman claimed, in the language of section 27 of the Uniform Act, Ã¢ÂÂa lien for all lawful charges for storage and preservation of the goods,' also for all lawful claims for money advanced, interest, insurance, transportation, labor, weighing, coopering and other charges and expenses, in relation to such goodsÃ¢ÂÂ. In the latter part of March the Western Distillers Corporation, being indebted to plaintiff, besides making payment of a sum of money, transferred to plaintiff certain personal property, and also the 20 barrels of whiskey in question by assignment and delivery of the warehouse receipt therefor. Thereafter on June 12th, the plaintiff tendered to defendant the sum of $9, claimed by plaintiff to be the amount for which defendant had a lawful lien; and demanded delivery of the whiskey described in the *Supp. 751warehouse receipt. The tender was refused and delivery-withheld upon the ground that, in the general account between defendant and Western Distillers Corporation, there was a balance owing to defendant in a large amount for money advanced for taxes, bottling and other items.
PlaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs complaint, thereafter filed, is one in claim and delivery for the whiskey in question.
The defendant in its answer pleads that at the time of plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs demand there was owing to defendant by plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs assignor not only the storage charges on the lot in question, but sums of money for advances made at the special instance and request of plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs assignor. And defendant asserted a lien upon the lot in question for all unpaid charges and advances.
The court made written findings to the effect that the value of the whiskey in suit was $1600 and that plaintiff was entitled to delivery of the lot, or in lieu thereof to the sum of $1600 upon payment to defendant of $16,181.88, representing the amount of the lien of defendant. From the judgment entered accordingly the plaintiff prosecutes this appeal.
In plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs memorandum it is urged, first, that under section 1856 of the Civil Code a warehouseman has no general lien for advances; and secondly, that under the Uniform Warehouse Receipts Act there is no lien for a general balance of account; and moreover, that payment of taxes is not for preservation of the goods, but is in effect a loan.
In support of plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs contention that a warehousemanÃ¢ÂÂs lien is special only, three California cases are cited. Stewart v. Naud, 125 Cal. 596 [58 Pac. 186], was decided in 1899, about ten years before the Uniform Warehouse Receipts Act was adopted in this state. Boas v. De Pue Warehouse Co., 69 Cal. App. 246, 250 [230 Pac. 980], presented the question whether, after the withdrawal of a part of a single bailment, a lien was retained on the residue for the entire amount of charges on the original quantity. In holding that the lien of the entire amount was retained, the court adopted a passage from 27 Ruling Case Law, page 1007, in which incidentally it was said that a warehousemanÃ¢ÂÂs lien is specific and not general. So far as any issue before the court was concerned, that statement was merely dictum. The language drawn from the volume cited was a statement of the common-law *Supp. 752rule; and on page 1008 attention is directed to the fact that under the uniform warehouse acts the lien is extended to all such charges and claims as are enumerated in section 27 of our act, as amended in 1933. Jewett v. City Transfer & Storage Co., 128 Cal. App. 556 [18 Pac. (2d) 351], is concerned, not with the character of the lien acquired by force of the statute, but with the enforcement of the remedy. The conclusion announced was that, under section 35 of the Uniform Warehouse Receipts Act, a warehouseman may enforce his lien either by a public sale upon notice as provided in section 33, or by a judicial sale under a decree of foreclosure, as authorized in the case of pledged property by section 3011 of the Civil Code.
Section 28 of the Uniform Warehouse Receipts Act, which is embodied in our statute, provides that except when goods are represented by a negotiable receipt, a warehousemanÃ¢ÂÂs lien may be enforced Ã¢ÂÂagainst all goods, whenever deposited, belonging to the person who is liable as debtor for the claims in regard to which the lien is assertedÃ¢ÂÂ.
In Knoxville Outfitting Co. v. Knoxville F. Storage Co., 160 Tenn. 203 [22 S. W. (2d) 354], the court said that the section in Ã¢ÂÂprescribing the reach of the warehousemanÃ¢ÂÂs lien is repugnant to the common-law rule. When there is conflict between the common law and a statute, the provision of the statute must prevailÃ¢ÂÂ.
The Uniform Warehouse Receipts Act is based on a statute adopted in New York in 1885; and the question whether the Ren under that statute was general or special received consideration in Stallman v. Kimberly, 53 Hun, 531 [6 N. Y. Supp. 706], affirmed 121 N. Y. 393 [24 N. E. 939]. It had long been established that wharfingers had a general Ren at common law, and the purpose of the statute was to place warehouse-men on the same basis, and put an end to any possible distinction between the two classes of bailees. Holding that the defendants, who were warehousemen, were justified in refusing to deliver articles stored until payment should be made of their charges and expenses of receiving and delivering other articles already withdrawn, Judge Barrett, at the close of his opinion for the general term, said 53 Hun, 531 [6 N. Y. Supp. 708] : Ã¢ÂÂThe fact is, warehousing has become an immense industry in these days, and the act is nothing more than a fair recognition of the advance. For*Supp. 753merly the wharfinger was in the habit of keeping a warehouse on his wharf, and the warehousing business was a sort of subsidiary appendage thereto. Now warehousing, as an independent institution, completely dwarfs the wharfinger; and it would be the height of absurdity to retain the general lien in the one case and deny it in the other. Upon the whole we are of the opinion that the defendants had a general lien upon the goods replevied, and that consequently the learned judge erred in directing a verdict for the plaintiffs. Our judgment is' therefore for the defendants, with costs.Ã¢ÂÂ
Likewise in In re Taub, 7 Fed. (2d) 447, 451, in a case arising under the New Jersey Uniform Warehouse Receipts Act, the court said: Ã¢ÂÂThe common-law lien has been in many states extended by statute, so as to give a general rather than a specific lien. This was done in New York. (Stallman v. Kimberly, 121 N. Y. 393 [24 N. E. 939].) And it was done in New Jersey. There is no doubt that the New Jersey Uniform Warehouse Receipts Law gives a general rather than a specific lien. Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ It was held in that case, however, that section 28 of the statute was not applicable, since the goods stored did not belong to the debtor, Taub, and he had not been so entrusted with possession as to create an estoppel against the owner.
The lien is likewise held to be general in Kaufman v. Leonard, 139 Mich. 104 [102 N. W. 632] and Roehl Storage Co. v. Wilson, 268 Mich. 691 [256 N. W. 598, 95 A. L. R. 1525],
The crucial question in the present case is whether the lien may be asserted for the amount of the taxes paid for account of the Western Distillers Corporation. The plaintiff contends that such advances are not within the purport of section 27 of the Uniform Warehouse Receipts Act, but constitute independent loans made upon the personal responsibility of the debtor. In support of this contention plaintiff, puts reliance on Schwab v. Oatman, 56 Mise. 393 [106 N. Y. Supp. 741], In that ease the plaintiffs had purchased-through a certain corporation, acting as the selling agent for-: a cotton mill, a number of bales of cotton cloth. According to custom, delivery was to be deferred pending shipping order from the purchasers. Meanwhile the goods were forwarded from the mill to the agent, and were placed by the *Supp. 754agent in the warehouse of the defendants, who issued warehouse receipts therefor, and made loans thereon to the agent prior to plaintiffsÃ¢ÂÂ payment to the mill for the goods. Subsequently the agent became insolvent, and the defendants refused to deliver the goods to plaintiffs except on payment of the loans and advances thereon, together with the storage charges on those as well as other goods stored by the selling agent.
The trial court held that the plaintiffs had title to the goods, and then proceeded to consider whether the defendants had a lien for the advances made to the selling agent and the storage charges on other goods. The statute in force at the time in New York provided: Ã¢ÂÂA warehouseman shall have a lien upon goods stored with him for his charges for storage, cartage, labor, freight, insurance and other advances thereon, including weighing and coopering in relation to such goods or other goods belonging to the same owner, and he may detain such goods until his lien is paid. Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ
In comparing this clause with section 27 of our statute, which is in the language of section 27 of the Uniform Warehouse Receipts Act, it is to be noted that there is a material difference both in the phrasing and collocation of the provision in respect of advances. The New York statute gave a lien for Ã¢ÂÂcharges for storage, cartage, labor, freight, insurance and other advances thereonÃ¢ÂÂ, and in the case cited the trial court held that the words, Ã¢ÂÂother advancesÃ¢ÂÂ, under the rule of construing general words with reference to the words preceding them, should have their meaning limited to advances of the same general nature as advances made in handling or protecting the goods, and should not be extended to include loans made on the security of the goods.
In section 27 of the Uniform Warehouse Receipts Act there is quite a different setting, which renders the rule of ej-itsdero generis inapplicable. Section 27 extends the lien to Ã¢ÂÂall lawful charges for storage and preservation of the goods, also for all lawful claims for money advanced, interest, insurance, transportation, labor, weighing, coopering and other charges and expenses in relation to such goods.Ã¢ÂÂ
Upon an appeal in Schwab v. Oatman, supra, to the appellate division (129 App. Div. 274 [113 N. Y. Supp. 910]), the question of title was treated as the only issue; and *Supp. 755upon that point the court was not agreed. The majority opinion was for affirmance of the judgment of the trial court, while the dissenting opinion held to the view that at the time when the loans were made, the title was not in plaintiffs, but was in the selling agent; and that the plaintiffs had not shown a right to recover the goods from the warehousemen, who had made the advances innocently in reliance on the ownership of the selling agent. The case then went to the court of appeals (198 N. Y. 545 [92 N. E. 1101]), where on the strength of the dissenting opinion below, the judgment was reversed and a new trial was ordered. So in the final analysis it would seem that even under the language of the New York statute then in force, a lien for money advanced as a loan to an owner of goods was deemed enforceable.
In Russell v. Empire Storage & Ice Co., 332 Mo. 707 [59 S. W. (2d) 1061], the plaintiffs had stored several carload lots of eggs in defendantÃ¢ÂÂs warehouse, and had then borrowed from defendant money on each lot, executing a separate note for each loan, and as security pledging the designated lot and the warehouse receipt therefor. Each note was payable on demand, and provided that payment thereof, or of any other obligation of the makers Ã¢ÂÂnow existing or that may hereafter arise, is secured by the hypothecation of certain personal property delivered to the payeeÃ¢ÂÂ. A portion of the eggs having been spoiled through alleged negligence of defendant, and defendant having refused to deliver other portions without payment of all the amounts lent, plaintiffs sued for damages for breach of the storage contracts. After stating at page 732 that the circumstances showed that it was the intention of the parties that all the warehouse receipts should be security for all the notes, and that any surplus proceeds of sale of any one carload-lot should be applied to any deficiency in the payment of the loans on other carload-lots, the court added: Ã¢ÂÂMoreover, under our Uniform Warehouse Receipts Act a lien is provided, not only for storage or other charges, but Ã¢ÂÂalso for all lawful claims for money advancedÃ¢ÂÂ (see. 14400, R. S. 1929) which Ã¢ÂÂmay be enforced against all goods, whenever deposited, belonging to the person who is liable as debtor for the claims in regard to which the lien is assertedÃ¢ÂÂ. (Sec. 14401, R. S. 1929.)Ã¢ÂÂ
*Supp. 756The right to a general lien for advances under section 27 of the Uniform Warehouse Receipts Act had consideration also in two decisions of the Supreme Court of Washington in the case of State Bank of Wilbur v. Almira Farmers Warehouse Co., the decision in the first appeal being reported in 123 Wash. 354 [212 Pac. 543]; and in the second appeal in 131 Wash. 623 [230 Pac. 817].
In that case a farmer, John Hansen, stored in the warehouse a quantity of wheat grown by him, and received at the time the Ã¢ÂÂweigh ticketsÃ¢ÂÂ therefor. He was indebted to the bank for preexisting loans, and owed the defendant about $2,300 for. oats, sacks, twine, hay and coal. The Ã¢ÂÂweigh ticketsÃ¢ÂÂ, when received b;^ Hansen, were endorsed by him, and delivered to the bank in partial payment of his indebtedness. Later at the request of the bank the defendant issued two warehouse receipts for the wheat, noting thereon the amounts of defendantÃ¢ÂÂs advances to Hansen. The bank thereupon demanded delivery of the wheat, tendering the receipts duly endorsed and an amount sufficient to pay all charges for storing and handling. As the defendant refused to make delivery unless the amount of its advances was also paid, the bank sued in replevin. The decision in the trial court was in favor of the bank, but on appeal (123 Wash. 354 [212 Pac. 543]), after quoting section 27 of the Uniform Warehouse Receipts Act, the court held that the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs advances, which were made in connection with the growing and handling of the grain in question, clearly fell within the provisions of section 27. The case having been remanded, a new trial was had resulting in judgment for the defendant. On the appeal by the bank from that judgment (131 Wash. 623 [230 Pac. 817]), it was contended that the lien for advances should be limited to expenditures made for the benefit of the wheat while it was stored or in transit to defendantÃ¢ÂÂs care. The court held, however, that as the advances of defendant had all been made before the date of the warehouse receipts, and the bank knew the amount payable, the defendant was entitled to retain possession of the wheat until all the advances and charges were fully paid.
In the first appeal (123 Wash. 354 [212 Pac. 543]), the bank, citing the New York ease of Schwab v. Oatman, 56 Misc. 393 [106 N. Y. Supp. 741], hereinbefore noticed, con*Supp. 757tended that the warehousemanÃ¢ÂÂs lien for advances was limited to those made in connection with the storage of the goods. But the court refused to sanction such limitation, saying: Ã¢ÂÂA comparison of the two statutes shows ours to be much broader than the one construed by the New York court, the statute in this state being the Uniform Warehouse Law as drawn by the commissioners.Ã¢ÂÂ
In the case in hand plaintiff would have us follow the decision in Chemical Nat. Bank v. New York Dock Co., 203 App. Div. 108 [196 N. Y. Supp. 414], affirmed in memo, in 236 N. Y. 560 [142 N. E. 283]. The facts in that ease, however, differentiate it from this. There, the bank issued a letter of credit to an importing company designed to enable the purchase of merchandise, to be paid for on presentation to the bank of a sight draft for the invoice cost with shipping documents attached. The draft having been paid by the bank, the importers, for purposes of storage and sale, were allowed under the customary practice to take possession of the goods pursuant to trust receipts executed in favor of the bank. Those receipts stated that the merchandise was to be held in storage as the bankÃ¢ÂÂs property, with permission for sale thereof by the importers for the account of the bank, the proceeds to be paid to it. The goods when landed were then stored by the importers with the defendant without disclosing, however, the bankÃ¢ÂÂs ownership; and a warehouse receipt issued to the importers was endorsed by them and delivered to the bank with an order for the goods. Thereafter the importers became bankrupt; and the bank, making tender of storage charges, demanded delivery of the goods. Delivery was refused on the ground that defendant had a general lien for indebtedness owing by the importers for the warehousemanÃ¢ÂÂs charges on other goods previously stored and withdrawn. The court held, however, that both the credit agreement and the trust receipt expressly provided that ownership remained in the bank, and contained nothing suggesting any right in the importers to pledge the goods. The ownership being in the bank, the warehousemanÃ¢ÂÂs lien was accordingly limited to the charges against the specific goods belonging to the bank. In so holding the court said: Ã¢ÂÂLetters of credit issued by banks form a large and important factor in important commercial transactions of the community. To adopt the *Supp. 758strained rule urged by the defendant, would make the issuance of letters of credit of the kind described herein a very precarious kind of business.Ã¢ÂÂ
In the case before us the plaintiff received an assignment of a nonnegotiable warehouse receipt, which expressly set forth that the warehouseman claimed a lien for all lawful claims for money advanced as well as for charges and outlays of the kinds enumerated in section 27 of the Uniform Warehouse Receipts Act. The plaintiff, as assignee of Western Distillers Corporation, had no stronger right than that company itself; and since a warehouseman issuing a nonnegotiable receipt has a general lien under sections 27 and 28 for all lawful claims for money advanced against all goods of his debtor, whenever deposited, we conclude that in this case the defendant was entitled to assert its lien against the goods in question for its advances for taxes and its charges and other outlays in relation to goods, whenever deposited by the Western Distillers Corporation previous to plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs demand.
The judgment for defendant is therefore affirmed with costs.

SCHAUER, J.
Plaintiff, by written lease dated September 21, 1934, hired from defendant a storeroom in a building owned by the latter. During the tenancy, the term of which included the dates here involved, the defendant was informed that plaintiff had sustained damage to personal property owned by him and kept in the leased storeroom, from rain water which had entered the premises. Such rain water appeared to have soaked through the northern exterior wall of the building in an area which included the space occupied by an earthenware drain pipe designed to carry rain water from the roof of the building. Attached to and built flush against the outside of this wall was an advertising sign, the *Supp. 769presence of which served to mislead both plaintiff and defendant as to the cause of the leakage.
Defendant but recently had had the roof of his building substantially renewed and promptly upon notice of the leakage, on or about November 1, 1935, made bona fide efforts through competent agents to find and stop the leak but apparently both plaintiff and defendant, influenced somewhat probably by their knowledge that the new roof had been installed only a few months before, by a competent roofing agent, placed the blame for the leak upon the sign and failed to ascertain, as subsequent events suggest they easily could have done, that the earthenware drain pipe above mentioned had become clogged.
The Bill of Exceptions, page 5, lines 22-26, states that the drain pipe Ã¢ÂÂextended perpendicular, embedded in said (northern exterior) wall, from the lower point of the northern side of the roof to the ground, and then by means of a right angle elbow extended horizontally under the sidewalk to the gutter where the rain-water from the roof escapedÃ¢ÂÂ. The wall in which the drain pipe was embedded is the same wall through which the water appeared to leak into plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs store. A further rain occurred on November 17, 1935, and it is for damages ensuing from leakage on that occasion that plaintiff seeks to recover in this action.
On November 18, 1935, a further examination of the roof of the building and its water-shed equipment was made and water marks were observed above the flashing. A water test in the drain pipe was then made and showed that it was clogged; insertion of a Ã¢ÂÂwire snakeÃ¢ÂÂ located the stoppage at or near the elbow. It was then obvious that the flow of water from the roof entering the drain pipe was stopped or impeded by the obstruction therein; that accumulating and standing in the said drain pipe it soon soaked through such pipe, or its joints, and the wall of the building; in the event of sufficient precipitation it finally pooled on the roof, and since the walls extended about two feet above the lower portion of the roof the water finally rose above the roof-wall flashing and seeped down into the building.
The storeroom leased to plaintiff constituted only a part of the building in which it was located and defendant retained exclusive control of the roof and the drain pipe. The trial court gave judgment for plaintiff, impliedly finding *Supp. 770that defendant was negligent in not having discovered and remedied the apparently readily ascertainable condition in the drain pipe prior to November 17th, and we think that the circumstances related, coupled with others appearing in the record, are clearly not insufficient as a matter of law to support such finding. (See Rathbun Co. v. Simmons, (1928) 90 Cal. App. 692, 696 [266 Pac. 369] ; H. C. Capwell Co. v. Blake, (1908) 9 Cal. App. 101 [98 Pac. 51].) Whether or not there was negligence chargeable to the defendant was a question of fact and upon that issue the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs finding is conclusive upon us.
Defendant, however, upon this appeal not only challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to show negligence but also contends that each of two so-called exculpatory clauses in the lease constitutes a complete defense. Such clauses are in material parts as follows:
Ã¢ÂÂTenant agrees ... to save the Landlord harmless and indemnified from all loss, damage, liability or expense incurred or claimed by reason of TenantÃ¢ÂÂs neglect or use of the premises ... or by reason of any injury or damage to any person or property thereinÃ¢ÂÂ and
Ã¢ÂÂTenant agrees that Tenant will not, and that agents, servants and others claiming the right under Tenants to be in the premises or in said building . . . shall not make any claim against Landlord for any injury, loss or damage to person or property occurring therein from any cause. Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ
We think that the first-quoted clause simply constitutes a covenant by the lessee to indemnify the landlord to the extent therein stated so far as claims by third persons are concerned and that it does not upon any reasonable construction operate to release the landlord from liability for his negligence resulting in damage to the tenant. Such clauses are strictly construed. Ã¢ÂÂStipulations of this character cannot be enlarged upon to include any damage not expressly waived, and it is generally held that such a stipulation will not excuse an injury occasioned by the negligence of the landlord in the management and use of any part of the premises remaining under his control. Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ (Le Vette v. Hardman Estate, (1914) 77 Wash. 320 [137 Pac. 454, L. R. A. 1917B, 222], See, also, Hollander v. Wilson Estate Co., (1932) 214 Cal. 582, 584, 585 [7 Pac. (2d) 177].)
*Supp. 771The last-quoted clause, however, presents a different situation. In it the tenant refers to both the premises leased and the building and agrees that he Ã¢ÂÂwill not . . . make any claim against Landlord for any injury, loss or damage to person or property occuring therein from any causeÃ¢ÂÂ. This covenant, while it does not use the words Ã¢ÂÂwaiveÃ¢ÂÂ or Ã¢ÂÂreleaseÃ¢ÂÂ or Ã¢ÂÂsueÃ¢ÂÂ, is, we think, similar in effect to a covenant not to sue. Ã¢ÂÂA covenant not to sue a sole tort feasor is, to avoid circuity of action, considered in law a discharge, and a bar to an action against such tort feasor.Ã¢ÂÂ (Hawber v. Raley, (1928) 92 Cal. App. 701, 704 [268 Pac. 943].) The apparent effect of the clause under consideration is therefore to release the defendant from liability for Ã¢ÂÂany injury, loss or damage to . . . propertyÃ¢ÂÂ occurring in the premises Ã¢ÂÂfrom any causeÃ¢ÂÂ. The parties themselves have used the quoted language and freely and voluntarily entered into the contract. It is sufficient to bar this action unless: (1) that language be deemed not to include injury caused by defendantÃ¢ÂÂs negligence, or (2) the agreement construed to waive liability for negligence be held void as contrary to public policy. We think neither proviso can be sustained.
In the ease of Cannon v. Bresch, (1932) 307 Pa. 31 [160 Atl. 595], we find a situation not dissimilar in principle from that before this court. The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania there says: Ã¢ÂÂPlaintiff alleges that the damage was caused by the negligence of the defendant and that the agreement does not exempt him from liability for his acts of active negligence. The lease provides that the landlord shall be released Ã¢ÂÂfrom all liability for any and all damage caused by waterÃ¢ÂÂ. The terms are emphaticÃ¢ÂÂthe word Ã¢ÂÂallÃ¢ÂÂ needs no definition; it includes everything and excludes nothing. There is no more comprehensive word in the language, and as used here it is obviously broad enough to cover liability for negligence. If it had been the intention of the parties to exclude negligent acts, they would have so written the agreement.Ã¢ÂÂ
In the state of Minnesota, in the case of Commercial Union Assur. Co. v. Foley Bros., (1918) 141 Minn. 258 [169 N. W. 793], we find the following pertinent holding relative to an even more similar factual situation: Ã¢ÂÂThe provisions of the lease relied upon by defendants appear in separate parts thereof and are as follows:
*Supp. 772Ã¢ÂÂ(1) Ã¢ÂÂSaid L. D. Coddon Company will make no- claim against the lessor for or on account of any loss or damage sustained by water or fire howsoever coming or being within said premises. Ã¢ÂÂ
Ã¢ÂÂ(2) Ã¢ÂÂThe lessor shall not be in any way or to any extent liable for any loss or damage to any property at any time at or within said leased premises, whether occasioned by fire or water or gas which may come or be therein or from any other cause whatsoever. Ã¢ÂÂ
Ã¢ÂÂIt is contended by plaintiffs in support of the demurrer to the answer: (1) That the provisions of the lease quoted,' properly construed, do not include or embrace damage or loss occasioned by a fire negligently started by the lessor or its representatives; and (2) if construed to include the negligence of the lessor, that the provisions are contrary to public policy and void. Neither contention can be sustained. Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ (See, also, Rodier v. Klines Inc., (1932) 226 Mo. App. 474 [47 S. W. (2d) 230]; Grady Co. v. Herrick, (1934) 288 Mass. 304 [192 N. E. 748] ; Kirshenbaum v. General Outdoor Advertising Co., (1932) 258 N. Y. 489 [180 N. E. 245, 84 A. L. R. 645] ; Weirick v. Hamm Realty Co., (1929) 179 Minn. 25 [228 N. W. 175]; Day v.

We are not unmindful that the Supreme Court of California in a department decision remarked by way of dictum in its opinion in the case of In re GarcelonÃ¢ÂÂs Estate (1894) 104 Cal. 570, at page 589 [38 Pac. 414, 43 Am. St. Rep. 134, 32 L. R. A. 595], Ã¢ÂÂA covenant made by one person not to sue another for or in respect to any matter arising out of future contracts between them, or by reason of any future tort, would, of course, be utterly void, as the parties to such contract could not have in view any particular subject-matter, or have any conception of - the amount which might be involved in the causes of action upon which the covenant was to operate,Ã¢ÂÂ but less than one year later the same court by a decision of its other department in the case of Stephens v. Southern Pac. Co., (1895) 109 Cal. 86 [41 Pac. 783, 50 Am. St. Rep. 17, 29 L. R. A. 751], held valid and operative a covenant in a lease exempting the lessor from liability, for future negligence. This latter decision was followed in *Supp. 773Northwestern M. F. Ass'n v. Pacific Co., (1921) 187 Cal. 38, 44 [200 Pac. 934] ; it was distinguished factually in Hiroshima v. Bank of Italy, (1926) 78 Cal. App. 362, 377 [248 Pac. 947], upon a basis which did not weaken it as authority herein and it was cited with approval as late as 1935 in the case of Andrews v. Horton, (1935) 8 Cal. App. (2d) 40, 46 [47 Pac. (2d) 496].  We think it is the law that Ã¢ÂÂA lease is a matter of private contract between the lessor and the lessee with which the general public is not concerned. And if the parties see fit to contract that the lessor shall not be liable for damages resulting from his negligence or the negligence of his employees, the law permits them to do so; and the courts must give effect to and enforce such contracts.Ã¢ÂÂ (Weirick v. Hamm Realty Co., (1929) 179 Minn. 25 [228 N. W. 175, 177].) It was said by the same court in Buck v. Walker, 115 Minn. 239 [132 N. W. 205, 207, Ann. Cas. 1912D, 882], and quoted in Weirick v. Hamm, supra, page 176, that Ã¢ÂÂPublic policy Ã¢ÂÂrequires that freedom of contract shall remain inviolate, except only in cases which contravene public right or the public welfareÃ¢ÂÂ.Ã¢ÂÂ
The Supreme Court of the United States, after discussing decisions upon contracts by which common carriers sought to exculpate themselves from negligence in respect to duties imposed by law, or where the parties had not been free to contract upon an equal footing, in distinguishing the ease then before it, said: Ã¢ÂÂThe principles declared in those eases are salutary, and we have no disposition to depart from them. At the same time it must not be forgotten that the right of private contract is no small part of the liberty of the citizen, and that the usual and most important function of courts of justice is rather to maintain and enforce contracts than to enable parties thereto to escape from their obligation on the pretext of public policy, unless it clearly appear that they contravene public right or the public welfare.Ã¢ÂÂ (Baltimore & Ohio S. W. Ry. Co. v. Voigt, (1899) 176 U. S. 498, 505 [20 Sup. Ct. 385, 44 L. Ed. 560, 565].) Upholding the same principles the Supreme Court of California in Stephens v. Southern Pac. Co., supra, at page 89, declared: Ã¢ÂÂIt has been well said that public policy is an unruly horse, astride of which you are carried into unknown and uncertain paths, and here that horse would be carrying us beyond all limits ever reached before, if respondentsÃ¢ÂÂ position should meet with *Supp. 774our approval. While contracts opposed to morality or law should not be allowed to show themselves in courts of justice, yet public policy requires and encourages the making of contracts by competent parties upon all valid and lawful considerations, and courts so recognizing have allowed parties the widest latitude in this regard; and, unless it is entirely plain that a contract is violative of sound public, policy, a court will never so declare.Ã¢ÂÂ
Concluded by the law of this state and the plain import of the partiesÃ¢ÂÂ contract, we are required to order that the judgment appealed from be and it is hereby reversed. The cause is remanded to the Municipal Court of the City of Los Angeles for a new trial, appellant to recover his costs of appeal.

Ã¢ÂÂThis appeal is from a judgment in favor of defendant in a claim and delivery action brought to recover possession of $852.34 in cash, eight cashierÃ¢ÂÂs cheeks for $50 each, and several packages of papers containing signatures of various individuals. Each cashierÃ¢ÂÂs check was payable to a different person. All of the property described in the complaint was seized by police officers of the city of Long Beach when they arrested appellant and charged him with the crime of pool-selling in violation of subdivision 1 of section 337a of the Penal Code. This charge was subsequently dismissed.
The trial court found that appellant, at the time of his arrest, Ã¢ÂÂwas conducting a lotteryÃ¢ÂÂ and that the personal property sought to be recovered in this action Ã¢ÂÂwas money and property offered for distribution by appellant as a lotteryÃ¢ÂÂ. As conclusions of law the court found that the said property was subject to forfeiture to the state of California, and plaintiff was not entitled to recover it. Both the finding of fact and these conclusions of law must be sustained.
Appellant operated a so-called Ã¢ÂÂchain letter storeÃ¢ÂÂ, his plan of operation having been substantially as follows: His Ã¢ÂÂcustomersÃ¢ÂÂ paid him the sum of $1.05 each, whereupon their names were placed upon a list in the order of payment, Five cents of each amount was retained by appellant for expenses and one dollar was retained in a fund or pool. When forty-nine others made similar payments the person making the first payment received fifty dollars, and thereafter when each customerÃ¢ÂÂs name reached the top of the list he received a like sum. Appellant was permitted to pay in one dollar and to place his own name on the list about once for every twenty-five other names. The packages of papers containing signatures, which plaintiff seeks to recover, were no doubt the lists thus made up.
Before appellantÃ¢ÂÂs arrest he had paid the sum of fifty dollars out of the pool to each of several persons. The cash *Supp. 762and the cashierÃ¢ÂÂs checks which are the subject of this action represented payments made to appellant by persons pursuant to the above-described plan. The fact that every person who participated in this scheme would not receive the full sum of fifty dollars, and that the amount to be received by each was dependent upon chance, is evident from the plan of operation, as well as from appellantÃ¢ÂÂs testimony that Ã¢ÂÂA pool cannot pay out indefinitely. No pool can go and pay out whatever they promise because all pools eventually break but they still retain an ownership or equity in the pool which they will receive eventually. ... Of course in operating a pool naturally the operators always have a certain amount of money or certain names to bank that pool in case of liquidation because all money taken in would be for liquidation whether it was ten cents on the dollar or a hundred cents on the dollar.Ã¢ÂÂ Appellant testified that he had been in the banking business for eighteen years and when asked whether he had calculated the chances of the people who paid money into the pool of ever getting their money back, he replied: Ã¢ÂÂYes, absolutely, I had it all fixed to get it back. They might not have gotten $50 but they would have gotten back money.Ã¢ÂÂ.Ã¢ÂÂ He also stated that if the pool dissolved, Ã¢ÂÂthey would get what was left. . . . Perhaps whatever was left after defraying expenses.Ã¢ÂÂ
Section 319 of the Penal Code reads as follows: Ã¢ÂÂA lottery is any scheme for the disposal or distribution of property by chance, among persons who have paid or promised to pay any valuable consideration for the chance of obtaining such property or a portion of it, or for any share or any interest in such property, upon any agreement, understanding, or expectation that it is to be distributed or disposed of by lot or chance, whether called a lottery, raffle, or gift-enterprise, or by whatever name the same may be known.Ã¢ÂÂ The enterprise carried on by appellant contained all of the elements of a lottery as defined in that section. (See People v. Hecht, (1931) 119 Cal. App. (Supp.) 778 [3 Pac. (2d) 399].) (1)
The scheme was Ã¢ÂÂfor the disposal or distribution of propertyÃ¢ÂÂ, to wit, the money placed in the pool above described. (2) The money was distributed Ã¢ÂÂby chanceÃ¢ÂÂ. If and when a personÃ¢ÂÂs name reached the top of the list he received fifty dollars, provided sufficient cash were in the pool to pay that amount. If there were a deficiency the pool would be liquidated and each person would receive less than fifty dollars, *Supp. 763and appellant, as the operator of the pool, would receive a share by reason of the presence of his name on the list. (3) The distribution was to persons who had paid a Ã¢ÂÂvaluable consideration for the chance of obtaining such propertyÃ¢ÂÂ, or a share or an interest therein. (4) Each amount received by appellant was paid to him upon the Ã¢ÂÂagreement, understanding, or expectationÃ¢ÂÂ that the fund was Ã¢ÂÂto be distributed or disposed of by lot or chanceÃ¢ÂÂ.
The dismissal of the criminal charge against appellant does not entitle him to maintain this action for a return of the property seized by the police at the time of his arrest. Even though he may not have been guilty of the crime of pool-selling with which he was charged, nevertheless the property was subject to forfeiture under section 325 of the Penal Code, which provides: Ã¢ÂÂAll moneys and property offered for sale- or distribution in violation of any of the provisions of this chapter are forfeited to the state, and may be recovered by information filed, or by any action brought by the attorney-general, or by any district attorney, in the name of the state. Upon the filing of the information or complaint, the clerk of the court, or if the suit be in a justiceÃ¢ÂÂs court, the justice, must issue an attachment against the property mentioned in the complaint or information, which attachment has the same force and effect against such property, and is issued in the same manner as attachments issued from the district courts in civil cases.Ã¢ÂÂ  Plaintiff attacks this section as lacking in due process of law, but we do not regard it as deficient in that respect. It provides that the forfeited property may be recovered by an information filed or action brought and that in connection therewith an attachment Ã¢ÂÂmustÃ¢ÂÂ be issued against the property with the same force and effect given to attachments in civil cases. The mere provision for an information or action imports an adversary proceeding in which the owner or claimant of the property shall have notice and an opportunity to be heard before the forfeiture is established. In addition to this is the express requirement for an attachment of the property alleged to be forfeited. The attachment or other seizure of property in a judicial proceeding is in itself notice to the owner that the court has assumed control of the property. By virtue of such a seizure the proceeding becomes one in rem or quasi in rem, in which the court has jurisdiction to deal with and dispose of the property on substituted service of process, *Supp. 764without actual notice to the owner. (Nichols v. Superior Court, (1934) 1 Cal. (2d) 589, 598, 599 [36 Pac. (2d) 380, 95 A. L. R 894]; Murray v. Murray, (1896) 115 Cal. 266, 276 [47 Pac. 37, 56 Am. St. Rep. 97, 37 L. R. A. 626] ; Blanc v. Paymaster M. Co., (1892) 95 Cal. 524, 530 [30 Pac. 765, 29 Am. St. Rep. 149] ; Herbert v. Bicknell, (1914) 233 U. S. 70, 74 [34 Sup. Ct. 562, 58 L. Ed. 854] ; Cole v. Cunningham, (1889) 133 U. S. 107, 116 [10 Sup. Ct. 269, 33 L. Ed. 538] ; Pennoyer v. Neff, (1877) 95 U. S. 714, 727 [24 L. Ed. 565].) Such substituted service, at least, is implicit in the provisions of section 325, and it provides due process of law as defined in People v. Broad, (1932) 216 Cal. 1, 7 [12 Pac. (2d) 941], on which plaintiff relies.
As already stated, the trial court found that all the property sued for was subject to forfeiture under section 325, and we find sufficient support in the Ã¢ÂÂ¢ evidence for this finding. As to the cashierÃ¢ÂÂs checks and the money, there is no room for question. It is readily inferable from the evidence that the cashierÃ¢ÂÂs checks were for sums which had become due to the payees named therein under the operation of plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs plan and were being held by him for delivery to said payees, and that the cash was being held for like payments to unidentified persons, some of which perhaps had not yet accrued. While the other property was not directly offered as prizes, the testimony of plaintiff in regard to liquidation, part of which is above quoted, would bear the construction evidently put upon it by the trial court, that this property was to be disposed of on liquidation and its proceeds divided among the contributors. This would bring it also within the terms of section 325. But even if, as to this property, the finding were unsupported, the judgment in regard thereto would be right. This property is of trifling-value and was all used by plaintiff in the operation of his lottery; in fact, most of it is of doubtful utility for any other purpose.
The law does not favor one who either operates or patronizes a lottery, and in a great variety of cases it has been held that the courts will not aid such a person to enforce his supposed rights, although in a like situation they would be open to one engaged in an innocent business or transaction. (Pacific Debenture Co. v. Caldwell, (1905) 147 Cal. 106 [81 Pac. 314]; Collins v. Lean, (1885) 68 Cal. 284 [9 Pac. 173] ; 16 Cal. Jur. 716; 38 Cor. Jur. 319-323, and cases there cited.) *Supp. 765See, also, Johnston v. Russell, (1869) 37 Cal. 670; Gridley v. Dorn, (1880) 57 Cal. 78 [40 Am. Rep. 110]; Takeuchi v. Schmuck, (1929) 206 Cal. 782, 787 [276 Pac. 345], where the same rule was applied to illegal transactions other than lotteries. More specifically, the court will not aid a party to recover property which has been used by him in violating the laws prohibiting lotteries, or which is designed for that purpose. (Lew U. Fon v. Chambers, (1924) 68 Cal. App. 244, 251 [228 Pac. 865] ; Collins v. Lean, supra.) The reasons for refusing the aid of the court become even stronger when the property, by reason of its illegal use, has incurred a forfeiture and is liable to proceedings by the state to ascertain and enforce that forfeiture. On both these grounds we think the decision of the trial court was right.
The judgment is affirmed, respondent to recover his costs of appeal.

Defendants, husband and wife, have appealed from a judgment against them in an action on a book account for medical services rendered by plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs assignor *Supp. 749to the defendant Ada P. Allum before her marriage to the defendant Arthur E. Allum, and while she was the wife of one C. W. Osborne, from whom she later obtained a divorce.  Such services, in part at least, were performed while defendant Ada and her then husband, Osborne, were living together, without any agreement upon her part assuming personal liability, and consequently to that extent the obligation to pay for the same became primarily, if not exclusively, the debt of said Osborne. (Chaffee v. Browne, (1895) 109 Cal. 211, 219 [41 Pac. 1028]; Lane v. McAlpine, (1931) 115 Cal. App. 607, 610 [2 Pac. (2d) 184].) As stated in the case last cited Ã¢ÂÂThe general rule is that upon the husband is imposed the duty to maintain his wife and children and where the wife living with her husband obtains on credit shelter or supplies needed in the conduct of this common domestic enterprise, she is his agent and incurs no personal liability. Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ
In this action, however, plaintiff seeks to recover from the defendants here sued upon the theory that defendant Ada P. Allum, while she was the wife of Osborne, became personally liable for the debt under the provisions of section 171 of the Civil Code, hereinafter quoted, and that defendant Arthur E. Allum upon marriage to Ada became liable for her antenuptial debts. If the Osborne debt for the services rendered does constitute an antenuptial debt of the wifeÃ¢ÂÂ that is, an obligation for which she is personally liableÃ¢ÂÂthen the judgment against the present husband must be sustained (Van Maren v. Johnson, (1860) 15 Cal. 308, 312; Vlautin v. Bumpus, (1868) 35 Cal. 214), even though such debt was contracted by the wife while married to the former husband (Johnson v. Taylor, (1931) 120 Cal. App. (Supp.) 771 [4 Pac. (2d) 999]; 30 Cor. Jur. 585), but if such debt is not a personal obligation of the wife her present husband is in no way responsible therefor. We think the answer to the obvious problem may be found within the terms of the statute and the cases construing it.
As first enacted (in 1872) and as it existed at the time of the decision in Chaffee v. Browne, supra (1895), 109 Cal. 211, said section 171 of the Civil Code merely provided that Ã¢ÂÂThe separate property of the wife is not liable for the debts of her husband, but is liable for her own debts, contracted before or after marriage.Ã¢ÂÂ In that form it did not purport to, and did not, impose upon either the wife or her property any *Supp. 750liability not created by her own contract. Under that state of the law the Supreme Court, in Chaffee v. Browne, supra, (1895), 109 Cal. 211, at 219, said: Ã¢ÂÂThe law justly imposes upon the husband the duty to maintain his wife and children, and does not absolve him of this duty save under exceptional circumstances; the evidence here shows only the ordinary case where the wife living with the husband obtains on his credit the supplies needed in the conduct of their common domestic establishment; for such purposes she is his agent, and incurs no personal liability; . . . when persons furnishing to families supplies of the character appearing here expect to charge the wife therefor, they must take care that they have a contract for her personal credit ...Ã¢ÂÂ That such general rule still obtains is evidenced by the excerpt from Lane v. McAlpine, (1931) 115 Cal. App. 607 [2 Pac. (2d) 184], hereinbefore quoted.
In 1905 (Stats. 1905, p. 206) said section 171 was amended to read: Ã¢ÂÂThe separate property of the wife is liable for her own debts contracted before or after her marriage, but is not liable for her husbandÃ¢ÂÂs debts; provided, that such property is liable for the payment of debts contracted by the husband or wife for the necessaries of life furnished to them or either of them while they are living together. Provided that the provisions of this act shall not apply to the separate property of the wife held by her at the time of her marriage or acquired by her by devise or succession after marriage.Ã¢ÂÂ This amendment introduced the imposition of liability for necessaries of life upon the wifeÃ¢ÂÂs separate property to the extent provided, and as limited in the statute, and, since the wifeÃ¢ÂÂs property could not be taken without due process of law, it has been held to mean that she must be made a party defendant in any action seeking to impress liability for necessaries upon her property and that in such an action a judgment may be rendered determining certain issues, to wit: Ã¢ÂÂ1. Was the debt to recover which the action is instituted contracted for necessaries of life? and, if so, 2. Were such necessaries furnished either to her husband or herself or both while they were living togetherf . . . She [the wife] is entitled to an opportunity, before her separate property capable of being so taken shall be seized in execution ... to show, if she can show, that the conditions prescribed by the statute upon which such property may be so taken do not in fact exist. ... On the other hand, the creditor *Supp. 751would be entitled to have the wifeÃ¢ÂÂs liability fixed by the judgmentÃ¢ÂÂthat is to say, an adjudication that her separate property which may be taken for that purpose, if any such she has, is subject to execution under such judgment.Ã¢ÂÂ (Evans v. Noonan, (1912) 20 Cal. App. 288, 295, 296 [128 Pac. 794].)
In 1915 said section 171 was amended to its present form, which is as follows: Ã¢ÂÂThe separate property of the wife is liable for her own debts contracted before or after her marriage, but is not liable for her husbandÃ¢ÂÂs debts; provided, that the separate property of the wife is liable for the payment of debts contracted by the husband or wife for the necessaries of life furnished to them or either of them while they are living together; provided, that the provisions of the foregoing proviso shall not apply to the separate property of the wife held by her at the time of her marriage or acquired by her by devise, succession, or gift, other than by gift from the husband, after marriage.Ã¢ÂÂ
To correctly interpret said section and the decisions relating to the same it is necessary to bear constantly in mind appreciation of the fact that nowhere in the common law can there be found any basis for imposing personal liability upon the wife for necessaries furnished to her or her husband while they are living together and that said section 171 (either as originally enacted or later amended) does not purport in terms to impose liability personally upon the wife as distinguished from her property. Such decisions, therefore, as Evans v. Noonan, supra (1912), 20 Cal. App. 288, and Ackley v. Maggi, (1927) 86 Cal. App. 631 [261 Pac. 311], in their references to so-called personal liability of the wife under said section, must be understood as dealing with the liability placed on her property by the statute. Aside from significance pertaining to debts contracted upon her personal credit, which present an entirely different matter not involved here, the words used by the courts in certain of the decisions cited, to the effect that the wife is made Ã¢ÂÂpersonally responsibleÃ¢ÂÂ and that such statute imposes Ã¢ÂÂa personal liabilityÃ¢ÂÂ, should be regarded as a convenient means of expressing the result attained in the particular cases in which they were used but not as generally enlarging that very limited liability which is created by, and exists only by virtue of, the statute, and which by that statute is imposed upon certain of the wifeÃ¢ÂÂs property specifically and not upon her or *Supp. 752her property generally. If such liability (for necessaries furnished the spouses, or either of them, while living together) were imposed upon the wifeÃ¢ÂÂs property generally, then it is possible that a general liability for such debts might be said to have been impliedly placed upon her, but since the only liability created by said section 171 which personally affects the wife is a limited and conditional one which reaches her through her property rather than her property through her, we cannot subscribe to any doctrine which would ascribe to such a narrowly circumscribed property liability the status and concomitants of an antenuptial debt upon her contracting a subsequent marriage.
The two divisions of the District Court of Appeal of the First Appellate District are not in entire accord in construing said section 171. Division One, in Turner v. Talmadge, (1919) 42 Cal. App. 794, at p. 796 [187 Pac. 969], holds: Ã¢ÂÂSection 171 of the Civil Code . . . recognizes such debt [for necessaries furnished the husband] as the debt of the husband and does not make the wife personally liable therefor, but merely provides that when the husbandÃ¢ÂÂs property has been transferred to the wife without consideration, this property may be regarded as the property of the husband for the purpose of satisfying any debts of his incurred for necessities furnished to both the husband and wife while living together. The effect of this section is to regard such property as though it had not been transferred.Ã¢ÂÂ Such ruling would seem to be in harmony with the theory of the decision of the Supreme Court in Chaffee v. Browne, supra (1895), 109 Cal. 211, and the statute as amended in 1905 and 1915, but we find that in Ackley v. Maggi, (1927) 86 Cal. App. 631, at 635 [261 Pac. 311], Division Two of the said District Court of Appeal, First District, said: Ã¢ÂÂWe think the result of the section [171, Civ. Code] is to permit an action to be brought directly against the wife for necessaries of life furnished as described in the section and whether the wife has or in the future may obtain property legally liable for the satisfaction of the judgment so obtained is a matter which may or may not be considered in the form of the judgment, but must in any event be considered at the time of an attempted satisfaction of the judgment out of her property.Ã¢ÂÂ
Even if we were to give to the decision last cited (Ackley v. Maggi, (1927) 86 Cal. App. 631 [261 Pac. 311]) the effect of overruling the earlier decision (Turner v. Tal*Supp. 753madge, (1919) 42 Cal. App. 794 [187 Pac. 969]), although such earlier decision seems sounder in reason and less likely to result in unnecessary multiplicity of actions, we still could not uphold the judgment now before us. The most that respondent can glean from any of the cases cited is a doctrine that a judgment against a wife predicated upon the theory of liability created or implied by section 171 of the Civil Code may be general in terms, deferring until levy of execution judicial pronouncement of its circumscription, thereby imposing upon the apparent judgment debtor the burden of establishing, through possible further litigation, the true character and limits of the statutory liability upon which the judgment is based, or such judgment may within its own terms declare the limitations which encompass the liability imposed by the statute. In neither event can the judgment be satisfied out of any property not covered by such statute and if in the judgment the court undertakes to declare the property out of which it may be satisfied the limitations of the statute may not be exceeded.
Here the court did assume to make such declaration in the judgment, decreeing, after awarding plaintiff the principal sum sued for and costs, Ã¢ÂÂSaid Sums of money to be paid out of the separate property of Ada P. Allum and out of the common property of Arthur E. Allum and Ada P. Allum husband and wife.Ã¢ÂÂ The obvious meaning of such decree, in so far as it concerns the separate property of the wife, is to order the judgment satisfied out of any separate property possessed by defendant Ada P. Allum; under said section 171 of the Civil Code, hereinabove quoted, and section 168 of the same code declaring that Ã¢ÂÂThe earnings of the wife are not liable for the debts of the husband,Ã¢ÂÂ the court could properly impose the liability of the judgment only upon such separate property of the said Ada P. Allum, if any, as was acquired by her by gift from her former husband, Osborne, during her marriage to him. Hence the judgment as to Ada P. Allum must be and is reversed and as to her the cause is remanded to the Municipal Court of the City of Long Beach for a new trial.
As to Arthur E. Allum, we think no obligation has been established and that none can be in any event superimposed upon him through the medium of the liability possibly devolving by virtue of the provisions of section 171 of the Civil Code upon certain apparently nonexistent separate *Supp. 754property belonging (?) to his wife. To see how any such liability could reach him under any theory applicable to the facts of this case even assuming the existence of property subject to operation of the statute, would require a perception as keen as the eyesight attributed to Lewis CarrollÃ¢ÂÂs character Alice, who in her adventures Through The Looking Glass, when asked by the King whether she could see anybody coming down the road, replied that she could see nobody and was immediately congratulated upon her eyesight by the King, who said: Ã¢ÂÂI only wish I had such eyes. ... To be able to see Nobody! And at that distance too! Why, itÃ¢ÂÂs as much as I can do to see real people, by this light!Ã¢ÂÂ (Lewis CarrollÃ¢ÂÂs Through the Looking Glass, Rand McNally, 1932 ed. p. 194.)
The very limited liability imposed by the code section here involved, which reaches the wife only through her possession of property acquired as a gift after a certain event and from a special source, which does not reach such property by reason of any personal obligation of the wife, which subjects only such property to payment of the debt and which debt is primarily that of another person (the first husband) who is generally liable therefor, is not a full personal liability and we think it is not within the rule that a husband marries not only his wife but also her debts.
The judgment against Arthur E. Allum is reversed, and since it may be that upon a new trial plaintiff can establish that part of the services were rendered not only to Ada P. Allum but upon her personal contract, liability for which would be incurred by the husband of a subsequent marriage, the cause as to said Arthur E. Allum is also remanded to the Municipal Court of the City of Long Beach for a new trial. Appellants are awarded their costs of appeal.

In each of these cases the defendant has been convicted of violating section 41.27, subdivision (b), of the Los Angeles Municipal Code, and appeals from the judgment. This code, adopted as an ordinance, appears to be a compilation of previously existing penal ordinances of the city of Los Angeles. Section 41.27 deals with the subject of intoxication, and subdivision (b) thereof reads as follows: Ã¢ÂÂNo person shall be on any private premises or in any private house in a state .of drunkenness or intoxication to the annoyance of any other person. Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ
This ordinance is attacked as unreasonable, oppressive and uncertain, and for all these reasons void. As to uncertainty, it is argued that annoyance is a state of mind, that what annoys one person may not annoy another, and that consequently the ordinance sets up no standard by which it may be determined whether any particular conduct is in violation thereof, citing In re Peppers, (1922) 189 Cal. 682 [209 Pac. 896], But ordinances, like other acts of legislation, are to be reasonably construed. (Civ. Code, sec. 3542; 23 Cal. Jur. 722, 723; Kipp v. Billingham, (1933) 217 Cal. 527, 530 [20 Pac. (2d) 318].) They are also, so far as possible, to be given a construction which will render them valid rather than void. (Medical Finance Assn. v. Wood, (1936) 20 Cal. App. (Supp.) 749 [63 Pac. (2d) 1219].) While annoyance is, partly at least, a mental condition, we think *Supp. 757this ordinance does not intend the existence of an annoyance to be ascertained solely by an inquiry into the actual state of mind of some other person present to witness the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs intoxication. No doubt there must be such a person present; otherwise the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs intoxication would not be to the annoyance of another person. We say this because the theory of telepathy is not well enough established to be the basis of legislation; nor is it to be supposed that the city council which passed this ordinance was postulating a venture into the realm of transcendental cognition or other means of acquiring knowledge in absentia or ex post facto, by the person annoyed. But the matter of annoyance is to be settled in accordance with the mental reaction of a reasonable person. Unless the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs condition of intoxication and resulting conduct are such as to annoy a reasonable person and another person present is in fact annoj^ed thereby, no violation of the ordinance appears. We find the proper criterion set up in the English case of Tod-Heatly v. Benham, (1887) 40 Ch. Div. 80, 94. That case involved ÃÂ¡ covenant of a lease that the lessee would not do on the leased premises anything which might Ã¢ÂÂgrow to the annoyance, nuisance, grievance, or damageÃ¢ÂÂ of the lessor or the inhabitants of adjoining houses. Construing this part of the lease, Lord Justice Cotton said: Ã¢ÂÂThey [the judges] must decide not upon what their own individual thoughts are, but on what, in their opinion and upon the evidence before them, would be an annoyance or grievance to reasonable, sensible people; ... It is not sufficient in order to bring the case within the words of the covenant, for the plaintiffs tq show that a particular man objects to what is done, but we must be satisfied by argument and by evidence, that reasonable people, having regard to the ordinary use of a house for pleasurable enjoyment, would be annoyed or aggrieved by what is being done.Ã¢ÂÂ Lord Justice Lindley said (at page 96), Ã¢ÂÂAnything which raises an objection in the minds of reasonable men may be an annoyance within the meaning of the covenant. . . . more than some fanciful distaste, which would not be sufficient.Ã¢ÂÂ Similar language was used by Lord Justice Bowen, the other member of the court.
Thus construed the ordinance is not within the rule of the Peppers case, supra, relied on by appellant. There a statute prohibiting the shipment of oranges Ã¢ÂÂwhen frosted to the extent of endangering the reputation of the citrus in*Supp. 758dustry, if shippedÃ¢ÂÂ was condemned as setting up no standard by which a shipper could regulate his conduct and hence Ã¢ÂÂtoo vague, indefinite and uncertain to form the basis of a criminal proceedingÃ¢ÂÂ. But that statute is quite different from this ordinance as we construe it. The qualities or characteristics to which reputation should relate were not stated by the statute there in question, but were left to conjecture. Moreover, the reputation of the citrus industry would depend on the opinion of all sorts of persons, and might probably be affected or created in part by the unreasonable whims or fantasies of the moment which no one could anticipate. Plere, however, upon the construction we have given the ordinance we have a standard of reason established. The ordinance is like the statute upheld in Ex parte Daniels, (1920) 183 Cal. 636, 646 [192 Pac. 442, 21 A. L. R 1172], where it was held that a law prohibiting the driving of automobiles at an unreasonable speed was valid and constitutional, against the objection that it was too uncertain. The Daniels case was cited with approval in In re Leach, (1932) 215 Cal. 536, 544 [12 Pac. (2d) 3], where it was held that the words Ã¢ÂÂnot offered to the publicÃ¢ÂÂ used in excepting certain matters from the Corporate Securities Act did not make the penal provisions of that act fatally uncertain. See, also, People v. Yates, (1931) 114 Cal. App. (Supp.) 782, 789 [298 Pac. 961], where this court held a penal statute requiring a father to furnish his child Ã¢ÂÂnecessary foodÃ¢ÂÂ, etc., was sufficiently certain, citing the Daniels case. Further authority for sustaining this ordinance is found in People v. Associated Oil Co., (1930) 211 Cal. 93, 108 [294 Pac. 717], where a statute not penal, but enforceable by injunction, which prohibited Ã¢ÂÂunreasonable waste of natural gasÃ¢ÂÂ by the operator of an oil well, was upheld against attack on the ground that it was too uncertain to provide any standard of conduct, the court saying: Ã¢ÂÂthe standard of reason has been applied in many cases where certainty is less capable of measurement than in the present case, . . . Instances Ã¢ÂÂwhere a manÃ¢ÂÂs fate depends on his estimating rightly, that is, as the jury subsequently estimates it, some matter of degreeÃ¢ÂÂ, are common.Ã¢ÂÂ  The attack on this ordinance as unreasonable and oppressive is largely based on the interpretation of the ordinance which we have rejected, that which would allow an annoyance to arise from the whim or fancy of some possibly unreasonable person. Upon our construction of the ordinance *Supp. 759it is not an arbitrary or unreasonable restriction of personal liberty but is a valid exercise of the police power. See In re Cutler, (1934) 1 Cal. App. (2d) 273, 280 [36 Pac. (2d) 441], also, City of St. Joseph v. Harris, (1894) 59 Mo. App. 122, 127, where an ordinance like this one was declared valid by reason of the inclusion in it of the Ã¢ÂÂannoyanceÃ¢ÂÂ clause, the court stating that drunkenness per se could not be prohibited.
In the case of People v. Beifuss, now before us, the defendant pleaded guilty, so no question arises as to the nature of the conduct necessary to constitute a violation of the ordinance.  In People v. Johnson there was evidence tending to show that the defendant was very drunk, and that while in that condition she was in a rooming house, talked thickly but in a loud and boisterous manner, cursed, used profane and obscene language, struck matches on the woodwork and threw them on the carpet, all of which was in the presence of the landlady and her tenants. The landlady testified that this conduct disturbed her very much. The trial court was fully justified in finding that this conduct would annoy a reasonable person and did annoy the landlady as well as the other persons present.
Other points made in these cases have -been considered but afford no ground for reversal and do not require further discussion.
The judgment in each of the above-entitled cases is affirmed.

Plaintiff, owner of an automobile which had been stolen, appeals from a judgment awarding possession of the car to the defendant, who holds it under a claimed lien on account of repairs and storage. ,
Section 3051, Civil Code, does not provide for a lien upon stolen property, for the repairing or storing of the same at the request of the thief. It is only because of that section that one not the owner, but the legal possessor, may subject the property to such a lien (Davenport v. Grundy Motor Sales Co., (1915) 28 Cal. App. 409 [152 Pac. 932]); otherwise the debt would have to be created by the owner or his authorized agent (Lowe v. Woods, (1893) 100 Cal. 408 [34 Pac. 959, 38 Am. St. Rep. 301] ; McTigue v. Arctic Ice Cream S. Co., (1912) 20 Cal. App. 708 [130 Pac. 165].) The provisions of section 425, Vehicle Code, are governed by the same principle. Sections 3051a, Civil Code, and 426, Vehicle Code, do not create liens but limit those created by others than the legal owners. (C. I. T. Corp. v. Biltmore Garage, (1934) 3 Cal. App. (2d) (Supp.) 757 [36 Pac. (2d) 247] ; Hackett v. California Laundry, (1935) 7 Cal. App. (2d) (Supp.) 757 [45 Pac. (2d) 833].)
It appearing from the facts as stipulated to, that the debt was contracted by one who had stolen the automobile, plaintiff owner was entitled to judgment for possession without payment of defendantÃ¢ÂÂs charges for repairs and storage.
The judgment is reversed with directions to enter judgment in favor of plaintiff, appellant to recover its costs of appeal.

CONLAN, J.
This is an action by plaintiff, as a mortgagee of an airplane, against T. C. Rice, recorder of San Mateo County and Edmund Godchaux, recorder of the city and county of San Francisco, to recover the sum of $1250 claimed as damages suffered by plaintiff by reason of the alleged omission of the defendants, in their capacity as county recorders, to comply with the duty imposed on such officers under section 4130 of the Political Code, as it read at the times in question.
Under date of May 17, 1932, the mortgage of the airplane had been made by its owner, Paul San Martino, to the plaintiff, his sister, to secure a loan of $1600. The plane was at that time at Mills Field in San Mateo County; but it was not until August 26, 1932, that the mortgage was acknowledged, verified, and thereupon recorded in the office of the county recorder, T. C. Rice, in volume 573 of official records, page 164.
Subsequently the plane was removed to San Francisco; and on October 3, 1932, the mortgage was recorded in the office of the recorder of the city and county of San Francisco, Edmund Godchaux, in volume 2421 of official records, page 434.
At the times under consideration section 4130 of the Political Code provided, among other things, that when a mortgage was filed in the office of a county recorder, purporting to create a lien upon Ã¢ÂÂlivestock, vehicles (other than motor *Supp. 777vehicles) or any other migratory chattels Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ, the recorder should collect, in addition to the recording charge, a fee of seventy-five cents, and thereupon should make, over his official signature, a certificate on forms provided for the purpose, and forthwith transmit such certificate to the secretary of state together with fifty cents of the special fee collected.
And by section 408 of the same code it was provided that the certificate should show the names of the mortgagor and the mortgagee, the date of record, the amount secured, and a description of the mortgaged property. As a means of notice to the public, the secretary of state was required to keep indices of such certificates in books labelled Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ Certificates of Mortgage of Migratory Personal PropertyÃ¢ÂÂ.
When plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs mortgage was recorded in the counties mentioned, plaintiff did not tender, nor did the recorders demand, the special fee of seventy-five cents. The recorder of San Mateo County did not at any time make, or transmit to the secretary of state, any certificate of the recordation of the mortgage; but a certificate was transmitted on December 22, 1932, by the recorder of the city and county of San Francisco, Edmund Godchaux.
At that time section 2965 of the Civil Code, in relation to subsequent removal of mortgaged personalty from the county in which it was situated when mortgaged, provided that the lien of the mortgage should not be affected thereby for thirty days after the removal; but, with certain exceptions, the lien was not preserved after the expiration of thirty days, unless the mortgage had been recorded in the county to which the removal had been made. One of the exceptions was to the effect that if a mortgage of Ã¢ÂÂlivestock, vehicles (other than motor vehicles) or other migratory chattels Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ had been duly recorded in the office of a county recorder in conformity with the general law relating to chattel mortgages (sec. 2959, Civ. Code), and within thirty days thereafter the county recorderÃ¢ÂÂs certificate of such recordation had been filed with the secretary of state, then such mortgaged property might be removed to any county of the state without in any way affecting the lien of the mortgage.
On December 15, 1932, the airplane was, and for more than thirty days prior thereto had been, in Alameda County without any recordation of the mortgage in that county. On that day a judgment creditor of the mortgagor caused exeeu*Supp. 778tion to be levied on the airplane by the sheriff of Alameda County; and execution sale was made on January 21, 1933.
The trial court found in the present action that at the time of the levy the plane was of the reasonable market value of $1200, but that it was not a migratory chattel within the meaning of section 4130, and that neither defendant had been under duty to transmit to the secretary of state the certificate mentioned in that section. Accordingly judgment-was rendered in favor of the defendants, and plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs appeal is from that judgment.
The fundamental question before us is whether an airplane was at the time included within the statutory category of vehicles (other than motor vehicles) or of migratory chattels.
In section 2 of the Vehicle Act of 1931 (the statute applicable at the times in question), which has been reenacted with slight modification of terms in section 311, read with section 450 of the Vehicle Code of 1935, the word Ã¢ÂÂvehicleÃ¢ÂÂ is defined as follows: Ã¢ÂÂEvery device in, upon or by which any person or property is or may be transported or drawn upon a public highway excepting devices moved by human power or used exclusively upon stationary rails or tracks; provided that for the purposes of this act, a bicycle shall be deemed a vehicle.Ã¢ÂÂ
And section 3 of the Act of 1931, like section 32 of the Vehicle Code of 1935, defines a Ã¢ÂÂmotor vehicleÃ¢ÂÂ as a vehicle which is self-propelled. Under sections 2 and 3 of the Act of 1931, read together, a motor vehicle, within the meaning of the statute, is then a self-propelled device in, upon or- by which any person or property is or may be transported or drawn upon a public highway.
The only distinction between the terms Ã¢ÂÂvehicleÃ¢ÂÂ and Ã¢ÂÂmotor-vehicleÃ¢ÂÂ, as defined in the act, is that a motor vehicle is a device self-propelled, while a vehicle is a device propelled by some force other than by its own, or by human, power. But both are put in the classification of devices which are operated on a public highway.
The definition of Ã¢ÂÂvehicleÃ¢ÂÂ as given in the Vehicle Act is consistent with the usual acceptation of the word, which is defined in WebsterÃ¢ÂÂs New International Dictionary as that in or by which any person or thing is or may be carried, especially on land.
*Supp. 779In the California Aircraft Statute of 1921 (p. 1421) the term, aircraft, was made to include every kind of vehicle or structure intended for use as a means of transporting passengers or goods or both in the air. And by the statute of 1929 (p. 1874) the definition was amended to conform to that in the Federal Air Commerce Act of 1926 (44 Stat. at Large, p. 573, sec. 9; 49 U. S. C. A., sec. 179) wherein the word is defined to mean Ã¢ÂÂany contrivance now known or hereafter invented, used or designed for navigation of or flight in the air; except a parachute or other contrivance designed for such navigation but used primarily as safety equipmentÃ¢ÂÂ.
In Florida the question arose whether airplanes were motor vehicles within the meaning of the tax laws, so as to be subject to an ad valorem tax imposed on all personal property except motor vehicles. The legislature had defined Ã¢ÂÂmotor vehiclesÃ¢ÂÂ to include motorcycles, automobiles, motor trucks and all other motor vehicles operated over the public streets and highways of the state. In an opinion rendered by the attorney-general (1932 U. S. Av. R. 252) he held that the legislature had in mind only motor vehicles propelled on or over the highways, and that consequently airplanes were subject to the ad valorem tax.
In a case of theft of an airplane in Illinois, which was transported to Oklahoma, the United States Supreme Court had occasion to determine in McBoyle v. United States, 283 U. S. 25 [51 Sup. Ct. 340, 75 L. Ed. 816], whether the provisions of the National Motor Vehicle Theft Act applied to aircraft. (41 Stats. 324; 18 U. S. C. A., sec. 408.) The definition given in section 2 of the act declares: Ã¢ÂÂthe term Ã¢ÂÂmotor vehicleÃ¢ÂÂ shall include an automobile, automobile truck, automobile wagon, motorcycle, or any other self-propelled vehicle not designed for running on railsÃ¢ÂÂ. The accused, McBoyle, had been convicted of violation of the act in the district court in Oklahoma; and on appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals (43 Fed. (2d) 273) the judgment was affirmed, with one of the judges dissenting. That judgment was reviewed and reversed by the Supreme Court, supra, Justice Holmes writing the opinion. After quoting the definition given in section 2 of the act, he said :
Ã¢ÂÂThe question is the meaning of the word Ã¢ÂÂvehicleÃ¢ÂÂ in the phrase Ã¢ÂÂany other self propelled vehicle not designed for running on railsÃ¢ÂÂ. No doubt etymologically it is possible to use the word to signify a conveyance working on land, *Supp. 780water or air, and sometimes legislation extends the use in that direction, e. g., land and air, water being separately provided for, in the Tariff Act . . . But in every-day speech Ã¢ÂÂvehicleÃ¢ÂÂ calls up the picture of a thing moving on land. Thus in Rev. Stats. Sec. 4, intended, the Government suggests, rather to enlarge than to restrict the definition, vehicle includes every contrivance capable of being used Ã¢ÂÂas a means of transportation on landÃ¢ÂÂ. And this is repeated, expressly excluding aircraft, in the Tariff Act, June 17, 1930, Ch. 997, Sec. 401 (b); 46 Stat. 590, 708. So here, the phrase under discussion calls up the popular picture. For after including automobile truck, automobile wagon and motor cycle, the words, Ã¢ÂÂany other self-propelled vehicle not designed for running on railsÃ¢ÂÂ, still indicate that a vehicle in the popular sense, that is a vehicle running on land, is the theme. It is a vehicle that runs, not something, not commonly called a vehicle, that flies. Ã¢ÂÂ...
Ã¢ÂÂAlthough it is not likely that a criminal will carefully consider the text of the law before he murders or steals, it is reasonable that a fair warning should be given to the world in language that the common world will understand, of what the law intends to do if a certain line is passed. To make the warning fair, so far as possible the line should be clear. When a rule of conduct is laid down in words that evoke in the common mind only the picture of vehicles moving on land, the statute should not be extended to aircraft, simply because it may seem to us that a similar policy applies, or upon the speculation that, if the legislature had thought of it, very likely broader words would have been used. United States v. Bhagat Singh Thind, 261 U. S. 204, 209 [43 Sup. Ct. 338, 67 L. Ed. 616].Ã¢ÂÂ
Since an airplane is not a device for transportation of persons or property upon a public highway, we are of the opinion that within the meaning of the provisions invoked from section 4130 of the Political Code, an airplane should not be classed as either a vehicle or a motor vehicle. Inasmuch as a motor vehicle, which is a self-propelled contrivance for transportation on land, was excepted from the operation of the section, there would be no sense in denying like exception to a self-propelled airplane, differing from the status of a motor vehicle only in being a contrivance for navigation of, or flight in, the air.
*Supp. 781It remains to consider whether for the purposes of the section an airplane should be deemed a Ã¢ÂÂmigratory chattelÃ¢ÂÂ, or merely a chattel according to the ordinary acceptation of the latter term.
In WebsterÃ¢ÂÂs New International Dictionary the word Ã¢ÂÂmigrateÃ¢ÂÂ is defined to mean: Ã¢ÂÂ1. To go from one place to another; esp., to move from one country, region, or place of abode or sojourn to another, with a view to residence; to change oneÃ¢ÂÂs place of residence; to move; as, the Moors who migrated from Africa to Spain; to migrate to the West; 2. To pass periodically from one region or climate to another for feeding or breeding, as various birds and animals.Ã¢ÂÂ
Ã¢ÂÂMigratoryÃ¢ÂÂ is similarly defined to mean: Ã¢ÂÂ1. Making a migration or migrations; moving habitually or occasionally from one region or climate to another; disposed to migration. 2. Roving; wandering; nomad; as, migratory habits. 3. Of or pertaining to migration.Ã¢ÂÂ
We have of late heard a good deal about Ã¢ÂÂmigratory agricultural workersÃ¢ÂÂ; and in defining Ã¢ÂÂmigrationÃ¢ÂÂ the same authority speaks of the migration of individuals, birds, mammals, bats, fish and insects.
From these definitions it will be noted that they all speak of animate bodies of one character or another, which move through habit or disposition.
The word Ã¢ÂÂchattelsÃ¢ÂÂ includes animate property (Smith v. Wilcox, 24 N. Y. 353, 358 [82 Am. Dec. 302]); and has been held to be applicable to dogs. (See cases cited in note in 67 Am. St. Rep., at p. 290.)
The descriptive term Ã¢ÂÂmigratoryÃ¢ÂÂ applies especially to animals whose instincts prompt them to make seasonal changes of habitat. Such animals often move, as does livestock, from place to place during recurring seasons in search of their natural means of subsistence.
It was not until 1923 that sections 2965 of the Civil Code and 4130 of the Political Code, as originally enacted, were amended to make special provision in relation to mortgages of livestock, vehicles (other than motor vehicles) and other migratory chattels. At that time airplanes were not novelties. They had played a notable part in the World War, and were in use thereafter as a means of cross-country transportation. If it had been intended to bring airplanes within the purview of the sections so amended, it is reasonable to infer that the legislature would have been as studious in *Supp. 782manifesting such an intention as in specifying livestock and vehicles, and would not have exposed aviators and county recorders to the hazard of misinterpretation of a term ordinarily applied to animate bodies. As Judge Holmes said, fair warning of the lawÃ¢ÂÂs intent in such matters should be given to the world in language that the common world will understand. The words Ã¢ÂÂmigratory chattelsÃ¢ÂÂ do not evoke in the common mind a picture of flying machines. They navigate the air as ships do the sea, rather than migrate like livestock and other animals.
And the statute should not by forced or broad construction be made so elastic as to subject county recorders to severe penalties upon the conjecture that the legislature intended to enwrap airplanes in the ambiguities of the expression, Ã¢ÂÂmigratory chattelsÃ¢ÂÂ. If the legislature had thought of airplanes, it is reasonable to conclude that words specific enough to identify them would have been used. The very fact that airplanes were not specifically mentioned points to an intention not to apply to them the policy applied to livestock and vehicles other than motor vehicles.
This view is strengthened by the statutory amendments made in 1935, whereby section 2959 of the Civil Code was repealed, and sections 2957 and 2965 were so reconstructed that, instead of referring to Ã¢ÂÂmigratory chattelsÃ¢ÂÂ, they made use of the expression Ã¢ÂÂanimate personal propertyÃ¢ÂÂ. (Stats. 1935, at page 2225.) By other amendments of sections 408 and 4130 of the Political Code (Stats. 1935, p. 1009) the provisions for transmission of a certificate by a county recorder to the secretary of state were deleted.
We conclude that the decision of the trial court in favor of the defendants was based on a sound interpretation of the language of the statute; and the judgment is therefore affirmed.

SCHAUER, J.
On or about the 28th day of February, 1936, at approximately 11:45 P. M., an automobile owned by plaintiff and, with its consent, being operated by one Hubert Lejeune, as rentee, was by the latter driven into defendantÃ¢ÂÂs *Supp. 784auto park at 743 South Spring Street, in Los Angeles.  DefendantÃ¢ÂÂs employee, Liles, accepted such automobile for parking, asked and received from the driver, Lejeune, the sum of 15 cents as a fee therefor, and gave to him a portion of a parking ticket bearing an identifying number. This transaction constituted a bailment for hire. (Beetson v. Hollywood Athletic Club, (1930) 109 Cal. App. 715, 718 [293 Pac. 821].) Lejeune immediately left the parking lot and upon returning within the next forty minutes found that the lot was dark, no attendant was present and plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs automobile had disappeared. Several days later the car was recovered, having been stripped of all removable parts, and abandoned. Plaintiff seeks to recover its reasonable costs laid out in pursuing, recovering and reconditioning such automobile. The complaint is in two alternative counts, one alleging the plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs damages as a result of defendantÃ¢ÂÂs asserted negligence and the other setting up the same damages as arising from a breach of a bailment for hire. The trial court found for defendant and plaintiff prosecutes this appeal, maintaining in effect that as to count I the admitted or undisputed evidence establishes defendantÃ¢ÂÂs negligence as a matter of law and that upon the theory of count II, on proof by plaintiff of the fact of bailment and subsequent failure to deliver possession of the property on demand, the law imposed on defendant the burden of proving that such failure was occasioned, without negligence on its part, by causes reasonably beyond its power to control; that the defendant failed as a matter of law to discharge the burden of proof so imposed on it.
The law governing the burden of proof in such cases as those presented by the two counts now before us has been heretofore discussed by this court in an unpublished opinion, prepared by Presiding Judge Shaw, which we now adopt in part in expression of our views herein. Ã¢ÂÂThe complaint contains sufficient allegations to state a cause of action for conversion of plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs automobile by defendant, a bailee thereof. Where such a cause of action is stated the plaintiff makes a sufficient prima facie showing by proof of the bailment and subsequent refusal of defendant, on demand, to make delivery according to the contract, and this casts on the defendant the burden of explaining his refusal. (Wilson v. Southern Pac. R. R. Co., 62 Cal. 164, 172; Cussen v. South*Supp. 785ern Cal. Sav. Bank, 133 Cal. 534, 537 [65 Pac. 1099, 85 Am. St. Rep. 221] ; Taussig v. Bode & Haslett, 134 Cal. 260, 263 [66 Pac. 259, 86 Am. St. Rep. 250, 54 L. R. A. 774] ; Dieterle v. Bekin, 143 Cal. 683, 688 [77 Pac. 664] ; Wilson v. Crown Transfer etc. Co., 201 Cal. 701, 706 [258 Pac. 596] ; Boot v. Skirving W. Co., 202 Cal. 75, 78 [259 Pac. 81] ; Atwood v. Southern Cal. Ice Co., 63 Cal. App. 343, 346 [218 Pac. 283] ; Greer v. Los Angeles Athletic Club, 84 Cal. App. 272, 283, 284 [258 Pac. 155] ; Ferguson v. Green, 99 Cal. App. 641, 643 [278 Pac. 1058].) According to some eases, as soon as it appears that the property has been stolen or destroyed by fire the burden shifts to plaintiff to show that negligence of defendant caused or contributed to the loss. (Wilson v. Southern Pac. R. R. Co., supra; Taussig v. Bode & Haslett, supra; Atwood v. Southern Cal. Ice Co., supra; Perera v. Panama Pac. I. E. Co., 179 Cal. 63, 64 [175 Pac. 454] ; England v. Lyon etc. Co., 94 Cal. App. 562, 567 [271 Pac. 532].) But it now seems settled that where the plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs action is strictly one of conversion, or upon the contract for failure to redeliver the property, the defendant must justify his failure, and if he relies upon the proposition that the property was lost by theft or fire without negligence on his part, the burden is on him to prove these facts, including his lack of negligence, in order to rebut the prima facie case of plaintiff. (Cussen v. Southern Cal. Sav. Bank, supra; Dieterle v. Bekin, supra; Wilson v. Crown Transfer etc. Co., supra (which overrules Atwood v. Southern Cal. Ice Co., on this point); Greer v. Los Angeles Athletic Club, supra; Ferguson v. Green, supra.)
Ã¢ÂÂUnder the rule settled in Wilson v. Crown Transfer etc. Co., if plaintiff alleges a loss by fire or theft, and charges this was due to defendantÃ¢ÂÂs negligence, the burden is on plaintiff to prove such negligence. See, also, Wilson v. California C. R. R. Co., 94 Cal. 166, 172 [29 Pac. 861, 17 L. R. A. 685], So it seems that the answer to the question, on whom is the burden of proof as to defendantÃ¢ÂÂs negligence, depends on the pleadings.Ã¢ÂÂ It follows, therefore, from the form of the complaint in this case, that as to count I the burden of proving negligence is on the plaintiff, while as to count II, the bailment and failure or inability to redeliver upon demand being admitted, the burden devolved on the defendant to establish its own lack of fault in the premises. If defendant prevails as to count II, obviously plaintiff cannot make *Supp. 786out a case on count I. Hence we consider the case as arising upon count II first.
Since the trial court rendered judgment for defendant, and since written findings of fact were waived, we are bound to assume that every issue tenable to decision under the evidence and pleadings was resolved in favor of defendant. Material to the case are the terms of the contract of bailment. Admittedly no word was spoken by either party to the transaction when plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs automobile was left with defendantÃ¢ÂÂs attendant (except perhaps to state the parking fee), but defendant seeks by three avenues to introduce into the contract an agreement that its responsibility as bailee should terminate at 12 oÃ¢ÂÂclock midnight. The three avenues sought to be traversed by defendant are as followsÃ¢ÂÂ¢
First, defendant calls our attentionÃ¢ÂÂwhile conceding that it did nothing to direct LejeuneÃ¢ÂÂs attentionÃ¢ÂÂto a small sign appearing inconspicuously (according to a photographic exhibit) on the north side of its lot, reading Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ Close 12 P. M. Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ. The striking contrast in size and prominence of display accorded by defendant to signs advertising its name and business as measured with the physically modest and psychologically comparatively concealed words Ã¢ÂÂClose 12 P. M.Ã¢ÂÂ, as to this phase of the defense, suggests an effort on defendantÃ¢ÂÂs part technically to comply with a city ordinance mentioned in the testimony as requiring the posting of a stated closing time rather than ordinary care in good faith to acquaint its customers with the fact that their ears would be left unlocked (or with keys equally available to thief and owner) and unattended after midnight. Likewise the other signs reading Ã¢ÂÂ15c Till MidniteÃ¢ÂÂ and Ã¢ÂÂ50e extra for locked earsÃ¢ÂÂ, in their substance and manner of display, are not well calculated to give any actual notice to potential bailors of facts material here. There is no evidence tending to show that Lejeune saw any of the signs referred to and he testified positively that he did not see them. We do not find, in the circumstances disclosed by the record in this case, that defendant has sustained the burden assumed by it of establishing as a term of the bailment contract the substance of any closing sign posted on the parking lot.
As a second method of establishing a contractual limitation in the conceded bailment, defendant produced evidence sufficient to establish that there was a general, but not uni*Supp. 787versal, custom or usage (for definitions and distinction see 25 Cal. Jur., p. 418) prevailing in Los Angeles for parking stations, of the type with which we are here concerned, to close at or before 12 midnight; such evidence also would have warranted the trial court in finding that plaintiff but not the rentee Lejeune, was familiar with that custom. Since Lejeune was not shown to have been engaged in the parking of automobiles as a business and as the cÃÂºstom or usage was not universal, he is not bound by the same in the absence of evidence that he had knowledge of it. (Lynch v. Bekins Van & Storage Co., (1916) 31 Cal. App. 68, 71 [159 Pac. 822].) Plaintiff's rights in this case, as the owner of the automobile, are no less than those of its rentee, Lejeune.
As its third ground for contending that its responsibility as bailee was limited by special contract, defendant points out that at the time of the inception of the bailment Lejeune was handed a Ã¢ÂÂparking ticketÃ¢ÂÂ or Ã¢ÂÂclaim cheekÃ¢ÂÂ containing, among other printed matter, the following words: [in red ink] Ã¢ÂÂ743 So. Spring St. [in black ink] We Close [in red ink] 12 P. M. [in black ink] NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR CARS AFTER CLOSING TIME.Ã¢ÂÂ Defendant admits that nothing was said or done, beyond the mere fact of handing him the piece of cardboard, to direct Lejeune's attention to such printed matter or any portion thereof. There was, however, evidence that the parking lot was well lighted (by four 1,000 watt lamps and some forty-five 60 watt lamps) and that Lejeune accepted without objection and retained such ticket. The trial court impliedly found that the circumstances disclosed afforded him a reasonable opportunity to read the printed matter thereon and accordingly that he became bound by it as a part of the bailment contract. Regarding a receipt given by the proprietor of a warehouse the Supreme Court said: Ã¢ÂÂIt was the duty of respondents to take note of its contents, if they had the opportunity, and their opportunity was .ample. The presumption, therefore, is that they did read it.Ã¢ÂÂ (Taussig v. Bode & Haslett, (1901) 134 Cal. 260, 266 [66 Pac. 259, 86 Am. St. Rep. 250, 54 L. R. A. 774].) In Curtis v. United Transfer Co., (1914) 167 Cal. 112, 114 [138 Pac. 726], the Supreme Court said, Ã¢ÂÂIt is true as a general rule, that a shipper or consignor who accepts a bill of lading or receipt containing the terms of a contract of carriage from the carrier without objection *Supp. 788assents to it and is bound by its terms whether he has knowledge of them or not under the rule of constructive notice.Ã¢ÂÂ On the same general subject the District Court of Appeal for the First Appellate District, Division Two, speaking through Presiding Justice Langdon (now Associate Justice of the California Supreme Court) stated the rule as follows: Ã¢ÂÂA great number of contracts are made by the delivery by one of the contracting parties to the other of a document in a common form, stating the terms by which the person delivering it will enter into the proposed contract. If the form is accepted without objection by the person to whom it is tendered, this person is, as a general rule, bound by its contents, and his act amounts to an acceptance of the offer made to him, regardless of whether he reads the document, or otherwise informs himself of its contents.Ã¢ÂÂ (Cunningham v. International Com. Y. M. C. A., (1921) 51 Cal. App. 487, 490 [197 Pac. 140].)
Upon the above-mentioned evidence, we cannot say as a matter of law that the trial court was unjustified in its implied finding that by the contract of bailment it was agreed (impliedly) that defendantÃ¢ÂÂs responsibility as bailee should cease upon the closing of its park at 12 midnight. In Kaye v. MÃ¢ÂÂDivani, (1935) 6 Cal. App. (2d) 132, 135 [44 Pac. (2d) 371], it is declared Ã¢ÂÂThat the responsibility of a gratuitous bailee or a bailee for hire can be diminished or increased by contract is settled.Ã¢ÂÂ See, also, Klein v. Baker, (1931) 112 Cal. App. 157, 162 [296 Pac. 631] ; Ambassador Airways, Inc., v. Frank, (1932) 124 Cal. App. 56, 63 [12 Pac. (2d) 127],  DefendantÃ¢ÂÂs representative, Liles, testified that plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs automobile was still on the lot when he turned off the lights and left at approximately 12:20 on the morning of February 29, 1936. This evidence is legally sufficient to support the implied finding that defendant fully discharged the terms of its contract.
The judgment is affirmed, respondent to recover its costs of appeal.

*Supp. 3Opinion
SOVEN, J.
State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company appeals from an order denying its motion to intervene in an action against its insured, defendant Kim. We conclude the trial court abused its discretion in denying the motion to intervene, and we reverse.
Background
The underlying matter is an action for personal injuries and property damage arising out of an automobile accident which occurred in August 1990. Defendant Kim was insured by State Farm. In February 1991, State Farm took defendant KimÃ¢ÂÂs statement, but despite many efforts, this was apparently the last communication State Farm had with defendant. Plaintiff filed and served its complaint against defendant Kim in May 1991. State Farm retained counsel for defendant, and an answer was filed in September 1991. Plaintiff served interrogatories and related discovery requests in October 1991. Defendant who, as noted, could not be located, did not respond. In April 1992, the trial court ordered defendant to comply with the discovery requests and imposed monetary sanctions. No response was filed. In September 1992, plaintiff filed a motion seeking further sanctions against defendant and his attorney. DefendantÃ¢ÂÂs counsel opposed the motion only as against counsel, declaring, in summary, that defendant had ignored all communications from State Farm and the attorneys. In December 1992, the trial court ordered that defendantÃ¢ÂÂs answer be stricken and that his default be entered.
That month, State Farm filed its motion for an order granting leave to intervene for all purposes, a proposed complaint in intervention, and a motion to vacate the default. The trial court, as noted, denied State FarmÃ¢ÂÂs motion to intervene; the motion to vacate was taken off calendar as moot.
After State Farm filed its notice of appeal in this case, State Farm filed a complaint in the superior court for declaratory relief against plaintiffs in the underlying action. The complaint details the events described above and seeks a declaration that State Farm has no duty to indemnify defendant for any judgment entered in plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs favor in the underlying case.
Discussion
An insurer may, in some circumstances, intervene and set aside a default against its insured as to itself. (Jade K. v. Viguri (1989) 210 Cal.App.3d 1459, 1468, 1470 [258 Cal.Rptr. 907]; see also, Elsea v. Saberi *Supp. 4(1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 625, 629-630 [5 Cal.Rptr.2d 742].)1 Jade K. relied on Clemmer v. Hartford Insurance Co. (1978) 22 Cal.3d 865 [151 Cal.Rptr. 285, 587 P.2d 1098], in which the plaintiff obtained a judgment against the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs insured and sued the insurance company under Insurance Code section 11580. Clemmer held that the insurance company was bound by the damages obtained against the noncooperating defendant insured in the underlying case, because the insurer at no time sought to have the default judgment set aside on any ground. (22 Cal.3d at pp. 884-885.)
Clemmer was the first case to discuss the right of an insurance company to vacate a default or judgment obtained against its insured. The court quoted from Code of Civil Procedure section 473: Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂThe court may, upon such terms as may be just, relieve a party or his legal representative from a judgment. . . taken against him through his mistake, inadvertence, surprise or excusable neglect.Ã¢ÂÂ (Italics added.) The term Ã¢ÂÂlegal representativeÃ¢ÂÂ has been interpreted with considerable liberality to permit one who would not normally be considered a Ã¢ÂÂrepresentativeÃ¢ÂÂ of a party but has a sufficient interest in the action to maintain the motion. [Citations.] . . .Ã¢ÂÂ (Clemmer v. Hartford Insurance Co., supra, 22 Cal.3d at p. 885.) The court ruled: Ã¢ÂÂThe standing of [the insurance company] to set aside the default judgment which it might otherwise be required to satisfy is therefore clear.Ã¢ÂÂ (Id., at p. 886.)
We are satisfied that under Clemmer, unless State Farm is allowed to intervene, it may have no other opportunity to litigate fault or damage issues in any action brought by plaintiff on its judgment under Insurance Code section 11580.2
Moreover, State Farm has presented another reason it should be permitted to intervene. In the underlying action, it would be plaintiffs burden to prove liability and damages. If State Farm is required to defend itself against a judgment in plaintiffs favor, the burden will be on State Farm to prove that any breach of the cooperation clause resulted in prejudice to the insurer. (Clemmer v. Hartford Insurance Co., supra, 22 Cal.3d at p. 882.) This means an insurer Ã¢ÂÂmust establish at the very least that if the cooperation clause had not been breached there was a substantial likelihood the trier of fact would *Supp. 5have found in the insuredÃ¢ÂÂs favor.Ã¢ÂÂ (Billington v. Interinsurance Exchange (1969) 71 Cal.2d 728, 737 [79 Cal.Rptr. 326, 456 P.2d 982].) Thus, the burden of proof would be reversed if State Farm is not permitted to intervene.
In reversing the trial court, we leave unresolved at least two issues. First, we do not decide whether the trial court should grant State FarmÃ¢ÂÂs motion to vacate the default as to itself.3 Second, State Farm as noted, has since filed a declaratory relief action against plaintiffs in the superior court. State Farm cannot have it both ways. In this action, State Farm would be aligned with its insured; in the declaratory relief action, State FarmÃ¢ÂÂs position is adverse to its insured. On remand, either State Farm must choose before the trial court rules on State FarmÃ¢ÂÂs motions or the trial court would be entitled to grant conditional relief.
The order denying appellantÃ¢ÂÂs motion to intervene is reversed, and the matter remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with the views expressed in this opinion. Appellant to recover costs on appeal.
Roberson, P. J., and Johnson, J., concurred.

Even if the intervener or insurance company is entitled to have the default set aside to permit the insurance company to present a defense, the default and judgment stand as against the defendant insured. (See Jade K. v. Viguri, supra, 210 Cal.App.3d 1459, 1467, fn. 4.)


Indeed, there is a suggestion in Clemmer that an insurer which does not take the opportunity to intervene and vacate a judgment in the action against the insured may not be permitted to show prejudice based on the insuredÃ¢ÂÂs failure to cooperate in the later action by the plaintiff against the insurance company. (See Clemmer v. Hartford Insurance Co., supra, 22 Cal 3d. at p. 886 [Ã¢ÂÂHaving failed to pursue remedies thus available to it, it cannot now claim prejudice or lack of opportunity to litigate damages.Ã¢ÂÂ].)


A default may be vacated upon a showing that the default was taken through Ã¢ÂÂmistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect.Ã¢ÂÂ (Code Civ. Proc., ÃÂ§ 473.) State Farm learned about the accident through plaintiffs insurer in August 1990, began investigating immediately, and, as noted, took defendant KimÃ¢ÂÂs statement in February 1991. By August 1991, State Farm knew it could not locate defendant Meanwhile, plaintiffs had initiated routine discovery requests. On this record, it is unclear whether State Farm could have avoided the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs inevitable terminating-discovery sanction by furnishing the requested information, verified by defendantÃ¢ÂÂs attorney. (See Code Civ. Proc., ÃÂ§ 2033, subd. (g).)
There appears to be no body of law discussing when a default should be vacated as against the insurer. In Sunseri v. Camperos Del Valle Stables, Inc. (1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 559, 561-562 [230 Cal.Rptr. 23], the insurer was not allowed to vacate a stipulated judgment because the insurer had refused to defend the insured. In Lipson v. Jordache Enterprises, Inc. (1992) 9 Cal.App.4th 151, 161 [11 Cal.Rptr.2d 271], the insurer was allowed to vacate a default because, after refusing to defend the insured, the complaint was amended to add claims arguably covered under the insurance policy.

Opinion
HARVEY, P. J.
Defendant appeals from the order of the justice court suspending imposition of sentence after his conviction on three counts of violating Lassen County Code section 8.04.040. That code section provides in part: Ã¢ÂÂ(a) No person shall own, keep or harbor any dog over the age of four months unless such dog is licensed as herein provided.Ã¢ÂÂ Later provisions of the section prescribe an annual fee of $5 for a neutered or spayed dog, and an annual fee of $10 for an unneutered or unspayed dog. The *Supp. 8ordinance also requires proof of vaccination against rabies in order to obtain a license. The ordinance provides for the issuance of a license tag that must be worn by the dog at all times. So far as the court can determine, there are no other regulatory provisions incident to the license requirement. Violation of the licensing requirement is an infraction punishable by a fine of $50 for a first offense and a fine of $100 for subsequent offenses. (Lassen County Code, ÃÂ§ 8.04.170.)
There are other regulations pertaining to dogs in the Lassen County Code, but those regulationsÃ¢ÂÂsuch as prohibiting dogs from running at largeÃ¢ÂÂare applicable whether or not the dogs are licensed pursuant to the ordinance.
In the trial court, the complaint accused the defendant of violating the Lassen County Code section quoted above. The complaint was in three counts, each count alleging that the defendant kept an unlicensed dog. The defendant demurred to the complaint, and the demurrer was overruled. The parties then stipulated to the facts, and the defendant was found guilty on all three counts. Imposition of sentence was suspended, and a notice of appeal was thereupon filed.
The facts as settled by the stipulation of the parties in the trial court are: The defendant is an Indian. He is a tribal member of the Susanville Indian RancherÃÂ­a, a federally recognized Indian tribe. He resides within the boundaries of the Susanville Indian RancherÃÂ­a upon land that is held in trust for the benefit of the Indians of the Susanville Indian RancherÃÂ­a by the United States of America. He owns three dogs, which at all times alleged in the complaint were restricted to his backyard on the RancherÃÂ­a. The dogs have been vaccinated for rabies, but the dogs are not licensed pursuant to Lassen County Code section 8.04.040.
The respondent has failed to file a brief, despite a notification from the clerk that the brief was overdue and the cause would be submitted without a respondentÃ¢ÂÂs brief if none were filed. In the trial court, however, the People filed points and authorities in opposition to the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs demurrer, and those points and authorities address the issue of whether the Lassen County dog control ordinance can require a resident of the Susanville Indian RancherÃÂ­a to obtain a dog license. The issue is of great importance to both the inhabitants of the Susanville RancherÃÂ­a and the other inhabitants of Lassen County. Hence, this court will consider those points and authorities and will decide the issue as if the respondent had filed a brief.
Section 1162 of title 18 of the United States Code provides:
Ã¢ÂÂ(a) Each of the states or Territories listed in the following table shall have jurisdiction over offenses committed by or against Indians in the areas *Supp. 9of Indian country listed opposite the name of the State or Territory to the same extent that such State or Territory has jurisdiction over offenses committed elsewhere within the State or Territory, and criminal laws of such State or Territory shall have the same force and effect within such Indian country as they have elsewhere within the State or Territory.

Ã¢ÂÂState or Territory of Indian country affected

Ã¢ÂÂCalifornia ... All Indian country within the State.Ã¢ÂÂ
In regard to civil jurisdiction over Indian country, section 1360 of title 28 of the United States Code provides:
Ã¢ÂÂ(a) Each of the States listed in the following table shall have jurisdiction over civil causes of action between Indians or to which Indians are parties which arise in the areas of Indian country listed opposite the name of the State to the same extent that such State has jurisdiction over other causes of action, and those civil laws of such State that are of general application to private persons or private property shall have the same force and effect within such Indian country as they have elsewhere within the State:
Ã¢ÂÂState of Indian country affected
Ã¢ÂÂCalifornia ... All Indian country within the State[.]Ã¢ÂÂ
In California v. Cabazon Band of Mission Indians (1987) 480 U.S. 202 [94 L.Ed.2d 244, 107 S.Ct. 1083], the United States Supreme Court held that Penal Code section 326.5, permitting bingo only if authorized by city or county ordinance and conducted with prescribed restrictions, could not be applied to bingo games conducted on the reservations of the Cabazon and Morongo Indians. The court also held that the Riverside County ordinances prohibiting gambling were inapplicable in the reservations of the Cabazon and Morongo Indians. The court explained that United States Code, title 18, section 1162, has granted to California broad criminal jurisdiction over reservation inhabitants in order to combat lawlessness in Indian country. The grant of jurisdiction in regard to state civil laws of general application and over private litigation in United States Code, title 28, section 1360, is far more limited. Hence, for example, a county cannot impose personal property taxes within Indian country. (Bryan v. Itasca County (1976) 426 U.S. 373 [48 L.Ed.2d 710, 96 S.Ct. 2102].)
*Supp. 10The court explained that simply because a statute or ordinance has a criminal sanction, such as a fine, for violation of its terms does not necessarily make the statute enforceable within Indian country. The court approved a distinction drawn in the Court of Appeals Ã¢ÂÂbetween Ã¢ÂÂstate criminal prohibitoryÃ¢ÂÂ laws and state Ã¢ÂÂcivil/regulatoryÃ¢ÂÂ laws: if the intent of a state law is generally to prohibit certain conduct, it falls within [the] grant of criminal jurisdiction, but if the state law generally permits the conduct at issue, subject to regulation, it must be classified as civil/regulatory and [18 U.S.C. ÃÂ§ 1162] does not authorize its enforcement on an Indian reservation. The shorthand test is whether the conduct at issue violates the StateÃ¢ÂÂs public policy.Ã¢ÂÂ (California v. Cabazon Band of Mission Indians, supra, 480 U.S. at p. 209 [94 L.Ed.2d at p. 255].) The court pointed out that California public policy does not prohibit all forms of gambling. Instead, California public policy is to prohibit some forms of gambling, to regulate other forms of gambling, and to leave some forms of gambling free of state regulation. The court then held that Penal Code section 326.5 is civil/regulatory and, hence, inapplicable to bingo games conducted on the reservations. Moreover, Riverside County could not, by ordinance, prohibit forms of gambling on the reservation that are not prohibited by state law. If the law in question is simply intended to regulate, as opposed to prohibit, the conduct at issue, then the law is not enforceable in Indian country.
In a footnote, the Supreme Court noted that it is questionable whether any strictly local ordinance with criminal sanctions is applicable in Indian country, but stated that it did not need to decide that question because of its conclusion that Riverside CountyÃ¢ÂÂs gambling ordinance was regulatory and, therefore, unenforceable in Indian country. The court said: Ã¢ÂÂ[United States Code, title 18, section 1162] provides that the criminal laws of the Ã¢ÂÂStateÃ¢ÂÂ shall have the same force and effect within Indian country as they have elsewhere. This language seems clearly to exclude local laws.Ã¢ÂÂ (California v. Cabazon Band of Mission Indians, supra, 480 U.S. at p. 212, fn. 11 [94 L.Ed.2d at p. 256].)
Here, the dog control ordinance in question is not a state civil law of general application to private persons and private property as described in title 28, section 1360 of the United States Code. Hence, it is not applicable to the Susanville Indian RancherÃÂ­a under section 1360. To determine whether it is applicable to reservation residents under United States Code title 18, section 1162, it is necessary to determine whether the law is Ã¢ÂÂcivil/regulatoryÃ¢ÂÂ or Ã¢ÂÂcriminal/prohibitoryÃ¢ÂÂ as those terms were used by the United States Supreme Court in the Cabazon case.
To determine the underlying purpose of the ordinance in question here, it is necessary to consider state law in order to determine state public policy.
*Supp. 11Food and Agricultural Code section 30951 prohibits anyone from owning or possessing a dog over four months of age unless the dog has a substantial collar to which is attached either a tag identifying the name and address of the owner or a metal license tag issued by the authority of a local governmental entity. Violation of the section is an infraction for which a fine of $50 can be imposed for a first violation and for which a fine of $100 can be imposed for subsequent violations. (Food & Agr. Code, ÃÂ§ 31401.)
The state law appears designed to facilitate the identification of the owner of a dog that is running at large or is bothering livestock or in some other way is causing problems in violation of the law. The identification enables law enforcement authority to take appropriate action against the owner, and it thus appears to be an essential part of the stateÃ¢ÂÂs enforcement scheme relating to dogs. State law also authorizes a county to pass a local dog licensing ordinance. (Food & Agr. Code, ÃÂ§ 30801.) The county ordinance may be made applicable within the territorial limits of a city if the city council so authorizes. (Food & Agr. Code, ÃÂ§ 30501.) But there is no requirement that a county adopt such an ordinance, and there is no requirement that any such ordinance be made applicable within the limits of a city.
The Lassen County ordinance does not appear, therefore, to be an expression of statewide public policy prohibiting the ownership of unlicensed dogs. Statewide public policy, as expressed in the Food and Agriculture Code, simply prohibits the ownership of dogs that do not carry ownership identification. Although the local ordinance also is designed to facilitate the identification of a dogÃ¢ÂÂs owner, there is no state policy that such identification must be by a locally issued license tag. The Lassen ordinance also appears designed to encourage the spaying or neutering of dogs and, in addition, to require dog owners to obtain rabies vaccinations for their pets. The vaccination requirement may or may not be applicable within the limits of a city located in Lassen County.
Through the imposition of license fees, the Lassen County dog control ordinance also appears to be a form of personal property tax on dog owners.
We conclude that possession of an unlicensed dog does not violate the stateÃ¢ÂÂs public policy. Under the standards declared in California v. Cabazon Band of Mission Indians, supra, 480 U.S. 202 and Bryan v. Itasca County, supra, 426 U.S. 373, the Lassen ordinance appears to be a local regulatory measure as well as a device to impose a tax on dog ownership. In either event, under the rules declared by the United States Supreme Court in the Cabazon and Itasca County cases, the ordinance is not enforceable in Indian country, and therefore the ordinance is not enforceable in the Susanville Indian Rancheria.
*Supp. 12The judgment is reversed, and the trial court is directed to dismiss the complaint.

JOHNSON, J.
Defendant Marcellus Davis (appellant) appeals from a judgment in an action for unlawful detainer. Appellant contends respondentÃ¢ÂÂs acceptance of Department of Housing and Urban Development Ã¢ÂÂSection 8Ã¢ÂÂ housing assistance payments made by the Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles on appellantÃ¢ÂÂs behalf following expiration of the 30-day notice period waived respondentÃ¢ÂÂs right to terminate the lease. We disagree and affirm the judgment.
I
Appellant was a tenant in Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Section 8 subsidized housing owned by respondent. The written lease executed by appellant and respondent provided appellantÃ¢ÂÂs share of the monthly rent was $129. Pursuant to the housing assistance payments contract executed by the Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles (HACLA) and respondent, HACLA was required to make monthly housing assistance payments in the amount of $321 to respondent on appellantÃ¢ÂÂs behalf.
On July 4, 1992, respondent served appellant with a 30-day notice to quit based upon appellantÃ¢ÂÂs violation of a covenant in the lease prohibiting automobile repairs on the premises. Appellant failed to vacate the premises at the expiration of the 30-day notice period. On August 18, 1992, respondent filed the instant action for unlawful detainer. On September 24, 1992, appellant filed a general denial. Appellant alleged as an affirmative defense, inter alia, that respondentÃ¢ÂÂs acceptance of payments by HACLA on appellantÃ¢ÂÂs behalf after expiration of the 30-day notice period with knowledge of appellantÃ¢ÂÂs breach waived respondentÃ¢ÂÂs right to terminate the lease.
At trial, respondentÃ¢ÂÂs agent testified on cross-examination that respondent received Ã¢ÂÂrentÃ¢ÂÂ from HACLA on appellantÃ¢ÂÂs behalf after service of the notice to quit. On October 26,1992, judgment was entered against appellant, awarding restitution of the premises, damages, attorney fees and costs to respondent.
On November 12, 1992, appellant moved for a new trial, or in the alternative, to vacate the judgment and enter a new and different judgment. At the hearing on the motion, appellant introduced into evidence a letter from HACLA stating respondent had accepted monthly Ã¢ÂÂrentÃ¢ÂÂ checks from HACLA in the amount of $462 for the months of July through November 1992. On November 18, 1992, appellantÃ¢ÂÂs motion was denied.
Thereafter, appellant filed a timely notice of appeal.
*Supp. 16II
Appellant contends respondentÃ¢ÂÂs acceptance of HUD Section 8 housing assistance payments made by HACLA on appellantÃ¢ÂÂs behalf following expiration of the 30-day notice period waived respondentÃ¢ÂÂs right to terminate the lease. We disagree.1
It is well established that a landlord who serves a tenant with notice of termination of tenancy and thereafter accepts rent from the tenant with knowledge of the tenantÃ¢ÂÂs breach of the lease waives the right to terminate the lease. (Kern Sunset Oil Co. v. Good Roads Oil Co. (1931) 214 Cal. 435, 440-441 [6 P.2d 71, 80 A.L.R. 453]; Code Civ. Proc., ÃÂ§ 1161.5.) However, it has not been decided in this state whether a landlord who serves a tenant with notice of termination of tenancy and thereafter accepts HUD housing assistance payments on the tenantÃ¢ÂÂs behalf with knowledge of the tenantÃ¢ÂÂs breach waives the right to terminate the tenancy. Thus, we look to the decisions of sister state courts for guidance.2
Appellant urges this court to adopt the holding of the Second District of the Appellate Court of Illinois in Midland Management Co. v. Helgason (1993) 241 Ill.App.3d 899 [181 Ill.Dec. 570, 608 N.E.2d 643] in which the appellate court determined HUD housing assistance payments constitute rent, and a landlord who serves a tenant with notice of termination of tenancy and thereafter accepts HUD housing assistance payments on the tenantÃ¢ÂÂs behalf with knowledge of the tenantÃ¢ÂÂs breach waives the right to terminate the lease. (Midland, supra, 608 N.E.2d at pp. 649, 651.)
As appellant notes in his supplemental brief, the decision by the appellate court in Midland Management Co. v. Helgason, supra, 608 N.Ed.2d 643 was reversed by the Illinois Supreme Court in Midland Management Co. v. Helgason (1994) 158 Ill.2d 98 [196 Ill.Dec. 671, 630 N.E.2d 836].
Upon reviewing the decisions by the appellate court and the Supreme Court of Illinois in Midland and the cases upon which they rely, we find the *Supp. 17reasoning of the Illinois Supreme Court in Midland Management Co. v. Helgason, supra, 630 N.E.2d 836 persuasive. We conclude HUD housing assistance payments do not constitute rent, and respondentÃ¢ÂÂs acceptance of HUD housing assistance payments on appellantÃ¢ÂÂs behalf after expiration of the 30-day notice period with knowledge of appellantÃ¢ÂÂs breach did not effect a waiver of respondentÃ¢ÂÂs right to terminate the lease.
Section 8 is a federal housing subsidy program administered by HUD. (42 U.S.C. ÃÂ§ 1437f.) Subdivision (a) of United States Code section 1437f provides in pertinent part: Ã¢ÂÂFor the purpose of aiding low-income families in obtaining a decent place to live and of promoting economically mixed housing, assistance payments may be made with respect to existing housing ÃÂ»
HACLA, a Ã¢ÂÂpublic housing agencyÃ¢ÂÂ as defined in the United States Housing Act of 1937, makes housing assistance payments to the landlord on behalf of the tenant pursuant to an Annual Contributions Contract (ACC) with HUD. In accordance with the ACC, HUD provides financial assistance to HACLA to make housing assistance payments on behalf of eligible tenants. HACLA is authorized to enter into housing assistance contracts with owners of housing in which some or all of the units shall be available for occupancy by low-income families. (See 42 U.S.C. ÃÂ§ 1437f(b).)
Pursuant to the United States Housing Act of 1937, HUD fixes the rent for a subsidized unit. (42 U.S.C. ÃÂ§ 1437f(c)(l).) HACLA, in accordance with HUD regulations and requirements, determines the rent the tenant must pay based on a fixed percentage of the tenantÃ¢ÂÂs annual income, then pays the landlord the difference between the fixed monthly rent (Ã¢ÂÂcontract rentÃ¢ÂÂ) and the rent the tenant is required to pay (Ã¢ÂÂtenant rentÃ¢ÂÂ). (42 U.S.C. ÃÂ§ 1437f(c)(3)(A); see also 24 C.F.R. ÃÂ§ÃÂ§ 880.101(c), 880.201 (1993).) The monthly subsidy payments made by HACLA are referred to as Ã¢ÂÂassistance payments.Ã¢ÂÂ (42 U.S.C. ÃÂ§ 1437f(c)(l).)
Appellant argues the United States Housing Act of 1937 and the HUD regulations promulgated in accordance with the act indicate Section 8 housing assistance payments were intended to constitute rent.
United States Code, title 42, section 1437f(c)(3)(A) provides: Ã¢ÂÂThe amount of the monthly assistance payment with respect to any dwelling unit shall be the difference between the maximum monthly rent which the contract provides that the owner is to receive for the unit and the rent the family is required to pay under section 3(a) of this Act . . . .Ã¢ÂÂ Section 880.101(c) of the HUD regulations states in pertinent part: Ã¢ÂÂThe total *Supp. 18amount received by the Owner for rent is called the Contract Rent.Ã¢ÂÂ (24 C.F.R. ÃÂ§ 880.101(c) (1993).) Section 880.201 of the HUD regulations defines Ã¢ÂÂcontract rentÃ¢ÂÂ as Ã¢ÂÂ[t]he total amount of rent specified in the Contract as payable by HUD and the tenant to the owner for an assisted unit.Ã¢ÂÂ (24 C.F.R. ÃÂ§ 880.201 (1993).)
Notwithstanding the foregoing, regardless of whether the monthly housing assistance payments are characterized as rent, the rights and obligations of appellant and respondent were defined by the terms of their agreement. As the Illinois Supreme Court noted in Midland Management Co. v. Helgason, supra, 630 N.E.2d at page 839: Ã¢ÂÂ[c]onceivably, even if such [housing assistance] payments constitute rent, parties entering into a lease agreement would, nonetheless, be free to agree on the effect of the landlordÃ¢ÂÂs acceptance of such payments after a tenantÃ¢ÂÂs breach.Ã¢ÂÂ Thus, in determining whether the payments made by HACLA had the same legal effect as if they were made by appellant, we must consider the terms of the lease to determine whether the parties intended that HACLA housing assistance payments constitute rent.3
The addendum to the lease (addendum) provides the owner may not terminate the tenancy except for: (1) serious or repeated violations of the lease terms and conditions; (2) violation of federal, state or local law pertaining to tenantsÃ¢ÂÂ obligations; or (3) other good cause. While these provisions do not expressly authorize eviction for a tenantÃ¢ÂÂs failure to pay rent, such authorization is found in federal provisions pertaining to subsidized housing. (See 24 C.F.R. ÃÂ§ 881.607 (1993).)4
The addendum neither defines nor refers to monthly payments by HACLA as Ã¢ÂÂrent.Ã¢ÂÂ The difference between the Ã¢ÂÂcontract rentÃ¢ÂÂ and the Ã¢ÂÂtenant rentÃ¢ÂÂ for which HACLA is liable is designated the Ã¢ÂÂhousing assistance payment.Ã¢ÂÂ The addendum indicates Ã¢ÂÂtenant rentÃ¢ÂÂ is the monthly amount to be tendered by appellant as consideration for the lease, and the HACLA housing assistance payments are characterized as separate payments made on the tenantÃ¢ÂÂs behalf. Thus, the lease terms do not establish the parties intended that housing assistance payments constitute rent.
*Supp. 19Furthermore, Ã¢ÂÂrentÃ¢ÂÂ is consideration paid by the tenant for the use, enjoyment and possession of the leased premises. (6 Miller & Starr, Cal. Real Estate (2d ed. 1989) ÃÂ§ 18:63, p. 141.) Since HACLA is not a party to the lease and the lease does not convey to HACLA a possessory interest in the property, HACLA housing assistance payments should not be considered Ã¢ÂÂrent.Ã¢ÂÂ
We agree with the reasoning of the court in East Lake Mgt. & Dev. Corp. v. Irvin (1990) 195 Ill.App.3d 196 [141 Ill.Dec. 279, 551 N.E.2d 272, 275-276], in which the First District of the Appellate Court of EEnois, holding that HUD housing subsidy payments do not constitute rent, observed that HUD regulations provide a property owner is entitled to receive vacancy payments from HUD for 60 days or more upon a showing that the owner is actively trying to fill a vacancy created by a tenantÃ¢ÂÂs eviction from a subsidized unit. (See 42 U.S.C. ÃÂ§ 1437f(c)(4); 24 C.F.R. ÃÂ§ÃÂ§ 880.611, 881.611 (1993).) Thus, vacancy payments are intended to reserve the subsidized unit for a subsequent qualified low-income tenant. (East Lake, supra, 551 N.E.2d at p. 275.) HUD subsidy payments made pursuant to the ownerÃ¢ÂÂs contract with HUD are also intended to induce the owner to participate in the Section 8 low-income housing program and offer protection to the owner from monetary loss resulting from participation in the program. (Ibid.) Under the circumstances, the landlordÃ¢ÂÂs acceptance of HUD subsidy payments neither constitutes acceptance of rent nor a waiver of the right to terminate the tenantÃ¢ÂÂs lease for noncompliance with its terms. (Id., at pp. 275-276.)
The Illinois Supreme Court in Midland Management Co. v. Helgason, supra, 630 N.E.2d 836, in agreement with the appellate courtÃ¢ÂÂs analysis in East Lake Mgt. & Dev. Corp. v. Irvin, supra, 551 N.E.2d 272, noted HUD regulations providing for vacancy payments for a period of 60 days or more following the eviction of a Section 8 tenant suggest housing assistance payments flow with the rental unit and not the tenant. Thus, unlike a lease, the housing assistance payment contract survives the landlord-tenant relationship. (630 N.E.2d 836 at p. 840.)
For public policy reasons, housing assistance payments should not be considered rent. As the Illinois Supreme Court explained in Midland Management Co. v. Helgason, supra, 630 N.E.2d at page 841: Ã¢ÂÂTo characterize the assistance as such would effectively defeat HUDÃ¢ÂÂs interest in the development and availability of economically mixed housing for low-income families. As a practical matter, landlords confronted with the possibiUty of forfeiture of breach for the acceptance of housing assistance payments would be less apt to open their doors to low-income families and would seek to fill their vacancies with non-rent assisted families.Ã¢ÂÂ
*Supp. 20For the foregoing reasons, we conclude HUD housing assistance payments do not constitute rent, and respondentÃ¢ÂÂs acceptance of such payments on appellantÃ¢ÂÂs behalf after expiration of the 30-day notice period with knowledge of appellantÃ¢ÂÂs breach did not waive respondentÃ¢ÂÂs right to terminate the lease.
The judgment is affirmed. Appellant to recover costs on appeal.
Roberson, P. J., and Watai, J., concurred.

Respondent has filed no brief on appeal. While in our discretion we might automatically order reversal, treating appellantÃ¢ÂÂs point as well taken (Berry v. Ryan (1950) 97 Cal.App.2d 492, 493 [217 P.2d 1015]), we follow the better practice of examining the record on the basis of appellantÃ¢ÂÂs brief and reversing only if prejudicial error is found. (Votaw Precision Tool Co. v. Air Canada (1976) 60 Cal.App.3d 52, 55 [131 Cal.Rptr. 335]; In re Marriage of Schultz (1980) 105 Cal.App.3d 846, 853 [164 Cal.Rptr. 653].) Nevertheless, we note the lack of assistance from respondent in doing so.


While decisions of sister state courts are not binding on California courts, they have persuasive value where the issues raised involve conflicting policies and the case is one of first impression in California. (See Bacich v. Board of Control (1943) 23 Cal.2d 343, 352 [144 P.2d 818]; Demeter v. Annenson (1947) 80 Cal.App.2d 48, 50 [180 P.2d 998]; Estate of Steidl (1948) 89 Cal.App.2d 488, 494 [201 P.2d 58].)


HACLA is not a party to the lease, and appellant is not a party to the housing assistance payments contract.


The housing assistance payments contract does not allow the owner to terminate the lease in the event HACLA discontinues monthly housing assistance payments on behalf of the tenant. Moreover, the contract provides in pertinent part: Ã¢ÂÂNeither the HACLA nor HUD assumes any obligation for the tenant rent, or for payment of any claim by the Owner against the Family, except in accordance with section 6 [pertaining to security deposits and reimbursement by HACLA for unpaid rent and damages]. The obligation of the HACLA is limited to making housing assistance payments on behalf of the Family in accordance with this Contract.Ã¢ÂÂ

JOHNSON, P. J.
Ã¢ÂÂThis is an action brought upon a policy issued by the defendant upon the life of Terrence J. Sweeney in the sum of $1,000 payable to the insuredÃ¢ÂÂs mother, May Sweeney, and embodying a supplementary contract for payment of double indemnity in the event of death by external, violent and accidental means, subject, however, to the proviso, among others, that Ã¢ÂÂdeath shall not have resulted from bodily injuries . . . sustained while or as a result of participating in or attempting to commit an assault or felonyÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ.
Upon the death of the insured, which occurred as the result of injuries sustained in an affray in which he was a participant, the defendant paid to the plaintiff as the beneficiary of the policy the sum of $1,000, the face amount of the policy, but refused to pay the additional sum of $1,000, claimed under the supplementary contract. The refusal was based on the contention that under the circumstances attending the insuredÃ¢ÂÂs death, the proviso mentioned barred all right to the double indemnity.
*Supp. 769The action was instituted for recovery of the sum of $1,000 under the supplementary contract. The case was tried with a jury; and upon conclusion of the evidence the defendant moved for a directed verdict in its favor. That motion was denied; and upon submission of the case to the jury, a verdict was rendered in favor of plaintiff for $1,000. Thereupon the defendant made, in alternative form, a motion for judgment in its favor notwithstanding the verdict. That motion having been denied, and judgment having been entered on the verdict, the defendant prosecuted this appeal.
It is conceded that the death of the insured resulted from injuries sustained while a participant in a hostile encounter. The real point of the controversy centers upon the question whether, without substantial conflict, the evidence shows that the insured started the affray or was to some extent at least a voluntary participant therein.
It becomes necessary therefore to give attention to the salient features of the testimony. On Saturday night, June 24, 1933, the insured, Terrence J. Sweeney, had attended a dance at Guerneville with his friend, Jack McCoy. While there, they had, as McCoy said, Ã¢ÂÂa few beersÃ¢ÂÂ; and as they left the dance hall shortly before 1 oÃ¢ÂÂclock Sunday morning and walked along the main street, Sweeney became embroiled in the encounter which led to his death. McCoy was unable to remember what occurred as he and Sweeney walked along or to tell anything about the circumstances leading to SweeneyÃ¢ÂÂs death. The story of the affray was told by seven young men who were engaged in conversation together as Sweeney and McCoy passed; and with two of whom separately, the brothers John and William Mulkeen, Sweeney came into conflict. Those seven young men, though present at the trial under subpoenas issued at the instance of defendant, were called to the stand as witnesses by the plaintiff; and when, after those witnesses had been examined at length, the plaintiff rested, the court had before it all the evidence in the case.
There were, as one would expect, some variances in minor details in the testimony of those young men; but from consideration of the evidence as a whole, we cannot escape the conclusion that it proves convincingly and without substantial conflict that Sweeney was himself the aggressor, and picked a fight without any provocation.
Four of the young men, including William Mulkeen, had been camping near Guerneville for a time. They were in an *Supp. 770automobile stationed at the curb near the dance hall. John Mulkeen and others of the party had come from San Francisco for the week-end. They had been at the dance with their friends; but as they were not staying at the camp, they stood on the sidewalk while thej' discussed with those in the automobile arrangements for a swim next day.
Without dispute in the testimony it appears that Sweeney and McCoy passed the group so engaged in conversation, and then turned and came back to the place where John Mulkeen, standing on the sidewalk, was talking with his brother William sitting in the car. Sweeney, on approaching those standing, asked which one of them had said something. On being informed that none of the group had said anything, he then accosted John Mulkeen, asking if the latter had said anything. On receiving an answer in the negative, Sweeney, without warning, hit John in the face. The two men wrestled together and fell from the curb to the roadway. Mulkeen disentangled himself and moved off, holding his bleeding nose. Sweeney followed, shouting to Mulkeen, Ã¢ÂÂCome back and I will give you some more.Ã¢ÂÂ As Sweeney was chasing John Mulkeen around the automobile, the latterÃ¢ÂÂs brother, William, got out. He told Sweeney that they did not want to fight with him and to let John alone. One of the party, Monahan, tried to stop Sweeney, whereupon Sweeney swung at him, and then turned his attention to William Mulkeen, challenging him to fight. William tried to back away, but was hit by Sweeney; and in seeking to defend himself, William Mulkeen gave Sweeney a blow which caused him to fall backward and strike his head on the pavement, thereby sustaining injury resulting in his subsequent death.
Sweeney was six feet four inches tall and weighed about one hundred and sixty pounds. John Mulkeen was of about the same weight, and six feet one inch in height; but William MulkeenÃ¢ÂÂs height was only five feet six inches and his weight one hundred forty-five pounds.
Such is a composite recital of the evidence, given without substantial conflict by those who witnessed the occurrence. (Joseph Chiesa, Tr. pp. 14-18, 22, 24; William Mulkeen, pp. 27-31, 34-36; Frank Monahan, pp. 40, 41; Frank Bertolucci, 47-50; John Mulkeen, 52-55; Angelo Chiesa, 59-61; Amonante Celoni, 67, 68.)
SweeneyÃ¢ÂÂs attack upon John Mulkeen and his encounter with William were so closely connected as to constitute parts *Supp. 771of a single transaction. Not only was his aggressive intent manifested at the start by his words, but his actions evidenced still more loudly his determination to work bodily harm. He was not merely a participant in the assault. He was the instigator. The hostilities were wantonly provoked bjr himself, and were of such serious nature that he might reasonably have expected that indignation would be aroused and that injury might result.
The case in essentials is almost a fellow to Gray v. Western States Life Ins. Co., 214 Cal. 695 [8 Pac. (2d) 126], in which double indemnity was denied under a policy excluding such recovery in case death should result from Ã¢ÂÂany violation of lawÃ¢ÂÂ by the insured. In that case the insured John E. Gray made a wilful assault upon a friend, who in self-defense and to protect himself struck Gray, causing him to fall and suffer injuries resulting in death.
The respondent cites in opposition Gilman v. New York Life Ins. Co., 190 Ark. 379 [79 S. W. (2d) 78], which dealt with a policy similar to that before us. The insuredÃ¢ÂÂs death was the result of a pistol shot fired by another. It was there held that the defendant had not sustained the burden of proving justification for the killing as against the presumption of accidental death. The court declared, however, that if the insured is killed by another in his necessary self-defense, then the insurer has a complete defense in an action on the policy for accidental death.  Considerable is said in respondentÃ¢ÂÂs brief about a presumption of innocence on SweeneyÃ¢ÂÂs part and an inference in favor of accidental death, which put the burden on the defendant to prove facts overcoming or offsetting such inference.
The plaintiff might perhaps have limited herself to producing merely sufficient evidence to make a prima facie case of accidental death, and then have given way to the defendant to present the witnesses it had subpoenaed. But plaintiff followed the course of appropriating defendantÃ¢ÂÂs witnesses; and when their examination had been concluded, all the facts and circumstances were before the court.
The witnesses to the assault were not contradicted or impeached in respect of any issuable fact, and neither the jury nor the court had the privilege of arbitrarily disregarding the positive evidence of actual occurrences. (Hayward v. Rogers, 62 Cal. 348, 372; Hutchison v. Holland, 47 Cal. App. *Supp. 772710, 712 [190 Pac. 1072] ; Hynes v. White, 47 Cal. App. 549, 552 [190 Pac. 836].)
The facts having been proved by the uncontradicted and unimpeached testimony of witnesses called by plaintiff, under circumstances affording no indication that the testimony was the product of mistake, inadvertence or untruthfulness, the evidence adduced was so wholly irreconcilable with the presumption and the inference sought to be invoked as to cause them to be dispelled and disappear from the case. (Mar Shee v. Maryland Assur. Corp., 190 Cal. 1 [210 Pac. 269].)
An inference is a deduction which the reason of the jury makes from the facts proved. (Sec. 1958, Code Civ. Proc.) It is not a mere conjecture or an arbitrary dixit without reason and without factual support.
As is said in the recent case of Reese v. Smith, 9 Cal. (2d) 324 [70 Pac. (2d) 933] : Ã¢ÂÂNeither a verdict nor a judgment can be based on guesses or conjectures. (Puckhaber v. Southern Pacific Co., 132 Cal. 363 [64 Pac. 480].) And also Ã¢ÂÂA finding of fact must be an inference drawn from evidence rather than on a mere speculation as to probabilities without evidence. A majority of chances never can suffice alone to establish a proposition of fact, since the slightest real evidence would outweigh all contrary probabilities. Ã¢ÂÂ (23 Cor. Jur., sec. 1750, p. 18.) Ã¢ÂÂ
We conclude that defendantÃ¢ÂÂs motion for judgment in its favor notwithstanding the verdict should have been granted. Accordingly the judgment for plaintiff must be reversed with directions to the municipal court to enter judgment for defendant for its costs of suit. Defendant will be entitled also to its costs on appeal.

TURRENTINE, J.
Ã¢ÂÂBased on a judgment for necessaries, to wit, house rent, which remained unsatisfied, defendants were cited into court for examination respecting property which they owned and which was subject to execution by court order for the payment of the judgment, and which was not exempt from execution. At the hearing it was established that the defendant Lawrence Hoskins was employed under a Works Progress Administration project at the Eleventh Naval District in San Diego, doing clerical work, and that he received therefor a monthly salary of one hundred nine and no/100 dollars ($109); that at the time of the hearing there was due and unpaid to him on earned wages twenty-five and 80/100 dollars ($25.80). At the conclusion of the hearing plaintiff requested the court to make an order requiring defendant to return to court at a later date and bring with him and pay to plaintiff one-half (%) of of his then earned wages. The trial court refused to make such order and discharged defendant in the supplemental proceedings. Plaintiff prosecutes this appeal.
Ã¢ÂÂExemptions are the creatures of statutes and exceptions to the general rule. No property is exempt unless made so by express provision of law. No assumed legislative policy can justify the courts in adding to the statutory list of exemptions. Legislators are presumed to understand the force and effect of the language which is used and to have contemplated all circumstances which would make it desirable *Supp. 781that other property not in the lists of exemptions should he added thereto.Ã¢ÂÂ (Estate of Brown, 123 Cal. 399, on 401 [55 Pac. 1055, 69 Am. St. Rep. 74].)
Ã¢ÂÂThe court may not make additions to the statutory list of exemptions. Consequently, if the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs property is of a class which is so specifically described or limited, his claim of exemption may not include more than the declared limitation.Ã¢ÂÂ (Security-First Nat. Bank v. Pierson, 2 Cal. (2d) 63, on 65 [38 Pac. (2d) 784].)
The above quotations are from cases considering and construing Code of Civil Procedure section 690 and its numerous subdivisions.
It seems to be conceded that the money in question earned by the defendant constitutes wages, and of this we think there can be no doubt. It is also true that the judgment herein is based on a debt for necessaries. Consequently one-half (%) thereof is by statute exempt from execution. (Code Civ. Proc., sec. 690.11.)
Defendant attempts to justify the decision of the lower court holding the entire wages exempt on the following provision of law:
Ã¢ÂÂAll money received by any person, a resident of the State, as a pension, or retirement or disability or death or other benefit, from the United States Government, or from the State, or any county, city, or city and county, or other political subdivision of the state, or any public trust, or public corporation, or from the governing body of any of them, or from any public board or boards, whether the same shall be in the actual possession of such pensioner or beneficiary, or deposited, loaned or invested by him, is exempt Ã¢ÂÂ¢from execution or attachment.Ã¢ÂÂ (Sec. 690.22, Code Civ. Proc.)
We do not think that the money earned by defendant comes within this law, for to do so would require us to hold that the money earned was to be received Ã¢ÂÂas a pension or retirement or disability, or death, or other benefitÃ¢ÂÂ, and to classify defendant as a Ã¢ÂÂpensioner or beneficiaryÃ¢ÂÂ.
It follows that one-half (%) of the wages due defendant are not exempt from execution in this case, and that the trial court should issue its process, order or power to compel payment thereof to plaintiff. Judgment reversed.

SCHAUER, J.
Plaintiff, which has a judgment against defendants Ben Taft Karnes and his wife, Matilda Karnes, for a common necessity of life (medical services furnished to their minor child by plaintiff's assignor) instituted proceedings under section 715 of the Code of Civil Procedure to compel defendants to apply in partial satisfaction of the judgment certain moneys earned by the defendant husband, as a member of the United States Navy, and which it was anticipated would be paid to him or his codefendant at a subsequent time, in due course of governmental business. From an order denying plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs motion and discharging the proceedings, this appeal is taken.
The above-mentioned section 715 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides that Ã¢ÂÂAfter the issuing of an execution against property, and upon proof ... to the satisfaction of a judge . . . that any judgment debtor has property which he unjustly refuses to apply toward the satisfaction of the judgment, such judge . . . may, by an order, require the judgment debtor to appear, ... to answer concerning the same; and such proceedings may thereupon be had for the application of the property of the judgment debtor toward the satisfaction of the judgment as are provided upon the return of an execution.Ã¢ÂÂ
It will be noted that the foregoing section has reference to a case where the judgment debtor himself has property which he unjustly refuses to apply toward satisfaction of the judgment. A further section, number 717, makes provision for the case where there is shown to be a debt due to the judgment debtor from a third person. It declares: 1 Ã¢ÂÂ After the issuing or return of an execution against property of the judgment debtor . . . and upon proef ... to the satisfaction of the judge . . . , that any person or corporation has property of such judgment debtor, or is indebted to him in an amount exceeding fifty dollars, the judge . . . may, by an order, require such person or corporation ... to appear . . . and answer concerning the same.Ã¢ÂÂ
*Supp. 769Said sections 715 and 717 of the Code of Civil Procedure are parts of a general plan (pt. 2, tit. 9, chap. 2, Code Civ. Proc.) for proceedings supplemental to execution in aid of the judgment creditor to the end of securing satisfaction of his judgment (11 Cal. Jur. 146). In furtherance of such plan, section 718 of the said code authorizes the court to require the attendance and take the testimony of witnesses in such proceedings; section 719 declares the power of the judge, or referee appointed by the judge, to Ã¢ÂÂ1 order any property of the judgment debtor, not exempt from execution, in the hands of such debtor, or any other person, or due to the judgment debtor, to be applied toward the satisfaction of the judgmentÃ¢ÂÂ and section 720 provides for the prosecution of an independent action by the judgment creditor where Ã¢ÂÂit appears that a person or corporation, alleged to have property of the judgment debtor, or to be indebted to him, claims an interest in the property adverse to him, or denies the debtÃ¢ÂÂ. Aside from the independent action provided for by said section 720 and the normal use of a writ of execution on tangible property, such supplemental proceedings contemplate enforcement of the orders of the court or referee through punishment for contempt for failure to obey them.
In the case before us the proof established that defendant Ben Taft Karnes was an employee of the United States Navy, earning a monthly cash wage of $96.60, which was paid by means of a check from the governmental establishment in the sum of $85 to defendant Matilda Karnes, the wife, and $11.60. in cash to the defendant husband. At the time of the hearing (July 1, 1938) the pay for the month of June had been earned but no part of it had as yet been received by either defendant; it was expected that in the ordinary course of business it would be received in about one week. Upon this showing plaintiff moved for an order that Ã¢ÂÂthe sum of Twenty-four and 15/100 Dollars ($24.15), be applied to the satisfaction of the Judgment, and that the said Defendants be ordered to return to the Court upon some date subsequent to July 8, 1938, for that purposeÃ¢ÂÂ. The motion was denied and defendants were discharged from the proceedings.
The order must be affirmed. The record presents no question as to abuse of discretion on the part of the trial court in refusing to order the defendants to return for further interrogation on a date subsequent when the debt due them should probably have been paid. The sole specification of *Supp. 770error is Ã¢ÂÂThat the evidence was not sufficient to justify the decision ... in this, that from the undisputed testimony . . . the Defendant Ben Taft Karnes had earned the sum of Forty-eight and 30/100 Dollars ($48.30) at the time of the hearing, which sum he had not yet received and which sum should have been ordered by the Court to be applied toward to [s-ic] the satisfaction of the Judgment.Ã¢ÂÂ The fact recited in the specification that the money sought to be reached had not yet been received by the defendant is itself a complete answer to the error assigned.  The court could not make a valid order requiring the defendant to make manual delivery of tangible property not in his possession or control (the money defendants had not yet received); likewise, the intangible property, the debt due to defendants, could be reached (if at all) only by proceedings under section 717, directed to the person owing that debt. The fact that in this case the debt was owed by a department of the United States government and that such debtor was therefore not amenable to the proceedings manifestly can neither alter the rule prescribed by the statute nor supply substance not contained therein.
We have not involved here any problem as to exemption of funds from execution, which seems to have been the point determined by the court in Hammond v. Hoskins, (1939) 30 Cal. App. (2d) (Supp.) 779 [79 Pac. (2d) 1116], and in which case the question of the power of the court to order disposition of funds not in the hands, or under the actual control, of parties before it appears not to have been considered.  A proper construction of the language of section 719, . Code of Civil Procedure, considered in connection with section 720 and other provisions of said chapter 2, title 9, part 2, of the Code of Civil Procedure, gives- authority to the court to order a particular personÃ¢ÂÂthe judgment debtor or his debtorÃ¢ÂÂto apply toward satisfaction of a judgment only such property as is within the possession or control of the particular person ordered to act. (11 Cal. Jur. 151.) Obviously the debtor could not be punished for contempt for failure to deliver possession of property not within his possession or control. The debt owed to defendant by the United States Navy was not property within his possession or control which he could be required to deliver to plaintiff. While the Supreme Court of Montana in the case of In re Downey, (1904) 31 Mont. 441 *Supp. 771[78 Pac. 772], upheld a commitment for contempt on failure to obey an order made on a somewhat similar factual showing, it did so solely on the theory that the order was not so wholly void as to be open to the collateral attack there made, saying (pp. 773, 774), Ã¢ÂÂThat the order directing payment to the clerk out of the moneys to be collected by the complainant was erroneous is apparent when we look to the statute [which is substantially the same as the California statute] authorizing the proceeding in aid of execution. . . . There is no authority to require the debtor to collect his ehoses in action and apply them to the debt. Under the facts of this case, the court should have appointed a receiver to collect the claim of the debtor and apply it, or so much of it as was necessary. . . . But though all this is true, is the order therefore void, so as to be open to collateral attack in this proceeding! We think not. . . . If . . . the court fell in error, this was error only in the exercise of jurisdiction, which may not be reviewed and corrected by habeas corpus.Ã¢ÂÂ (See, also, Bruton v. Tearle, (1936) 7 Cal. (2d) 48 [59 Pac. (2d) 953, 106 A. L. R. 580].)
The order appealed from is affirmed, respondents to recover their costs of appeal.

The defendant was charged with and convicted of being a person Ã¢ÂÂwho roams about from place to place without any lawful business Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ, in violation of the provisions of section 647, subdivision 2, of the Penal Code.
*Supp. 769The evidence upon which the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs conviction was predicated consisted solely of the testimony of a single police officer, who testified that he had seen the defendant walking on the streets or sitting in public Ã¢ÂÂcard roomsÃ¢ÂÂ in the city of San Diego, at various hours of the day and night, on ten or twelve occasions during the three months next preceding the date of trial, but that he did not recall any particular time when, or place where, he had ever seen the defendant. The insufficiency of this evidence for conviction is at once apparent. Not only does the testimony lack definiteness as to dates and places, but it is no more than could be offered against any citizen who has occasion to walk upon the city streets or patronize licensed places of business, or who, perchance, may wander about Ã¢ÂÂtaking in the sightsÃ¢ÂÂ.
Ã¢ÂÂRoamingÃ¢ÂÂ as used in subdivision 3 is qualified by the phrase Ã¢ÂÂwithout any lawful businessÃ¢ÂÂ. If the defendant was moved by the demands of some lawful business he would not be amenable to the charge of vagrancy because of his roaming proclivities. The record herein is entirely silent as regards the business of the defendant; whether it was lawful or unlawful, is not disclosed.
Ã¢ÂÂPlace to placeÃ¢ÂÂ as employed in the subdivision has never, so far as we know, been construed by our courts. The phrase obviously means any substantial change of position and is not necessarily restricted to mean from one city to another. One who roams from one place to another within the city without any lawful business would be amenable to the statute. The evidence in this case, however, is insufficient to show the existence of facts constituting a public offense.
The judgment is therefore reversed.

SCHAUER, J.
Defendant, having been found guilty of, and sentenced for, a misdemeanor, duly filed notice of appeal, and within the time allowed by law (five days after filing notice of appeal) served on the plaintiff and filed with the trial court a proposed statement on appeal. Such proposed statement was regular in every respect except that it failed to specify any grounds on which defendant intended to rely upon appeal, and plaintiff thereupon moved to terminate the proceedings on appeal on the ground that defendant Ã¢ÂÂhad failed to comply with the rules of the Judicial Council . . . in that he failed to serve upon the plaintiff and respondent in said action and file with the court within five (5) days after filing of Notice of Appeal or within the time allowed by the court for so doing a Proposed Statement on Appeal in which the appellant specified the grounds upon which he intends to rely upon appealÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ.
PlaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs motion was denied and the matter of settling the statement was set for hearing on April 5th. At that time, the defendant made a showing of prior inadvertence, in omitting a specification of grounds of appeal and proposed an amendment, which the trial court in settling the statement adopted and included in it, setting forth in detail specifications of the grounds on which defendant intended to rely.
From the order granting the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs motion to include such grounds of appeal in settling the statement, plaintiff appeals, contending, in substance, that the insertion *Supp. 762of such grounds in the original proposed statement is mandatory, i. e., a jurisdictionally essential procedural step and, being mandatory, the court cannot relieve from default therein. Such contention cannot be sustained.
Section 1468 of the Penal Code provides (since the amendment of 1935) that the records on appeals to the superior courts in criminal cases Ã¢ÂÂshall be made up and filed in such time and manner as shall be prescribed in rules to be promulgated by the Judicial CouncilÃ¢ÂÂ. Section 1467 of the Penal Code declares that such an appeal Ã¢ÂÂmay be taken by filing written notice of appeal with the court wherein the judgment or order appealed from is rendered, within five days after the rendition of such judgment or orderÃ¢ÂÂ. Rule 2 of the Judicial Council Rules provided for by section 1468 provides further: Ã¢ÂÂThe date of such filing shall be the effective date of the taking of such appeal. If subh notice of appeal is not filed as aforesaid within the time required, such appeal shall be void and of no effect. Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ Rule 3 prescribes that Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ The record on an appeal to a Superior Court in a criminal case shall consist of the following items or so many thereof as may exist in the particular case Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ and then enumerates various items including the complaint, plea, verdict, motions for new trial or arrest of judgment and orders thereon, minutes of the court, the judgment, the notice of appeal- and Ã¢ÂÂIn addition thereto, the statement or transcript on appeal, or both, settled and certified by the trial judge as hereinafter provided for in Rules 4 and 7Ã¢ÂÂ. Rule 4 requires that Ã¢ÂÂthe appellant shall, within five days after Cling notice of appeal, serve on the respondent and file with the trial court a proposed statement on appealÃ¢ÂÂ, and, furthermore, that Ã¢ÂÂIn every such statement the appellant shall specify the grounds on which he intends to rely upon appeal and set forth so much of the evidence and other proceedings as are necessary for a decision upon' said grounds. Said grounds of appeal shall be stated with sufficient particularity- to apprise the court and the opposing party of the rulings or other matters of which the appellant intends to complain, but this may be done by any general description calling attention to the points to be made, without specifying each separate ruling or other matter to be complained of. . . . No ground of appeal not so specified shall be considered by the Superior Court unless it shall appear to the satisfaction of said Court that the statement fairly and *Supp. 763fully presents the evidence and other proceedings necessary for a decision thereon.Ã¢ÂÂ
Rule 5 contains provisions for amendments to be proposed by respondent by way of alteration of or addition to the statement originally proposed by appellant, rule 6 for extensions of time in making up the statement and rule 7 for its settlement, engrossment and certification. It is significant here that said rule 7 requires that Ã¢ÂÂUpon the filing of such proposed amendments or the expiration of the time therefor without the filing thereof, the trial judge shall forthwith fix a time for settlement of the statement or transcript or both, . . . and cause notice thereof to be mailed, at least five days before the time fixed, to each party, or . . . his attorney . . . The trial judge shall at the time fixed . . . settle the statement or transcript, or both, and the amendments proposed thereto, if any, correcting, altering, or rewriting such statement or transcript, or both, as may be necessary to make the same set forth fairly and truly the evidence and proceedings relating to the specified grounds of appeal or the matters set forth by the appellant in support thereofÃ¢ÂÂ. Rule 8 declares the sanction that Ã¢ÂÂIf appellant fails to file such statement within the time required by these rules, such appeal shall be deemed abandoned and the trial court may on . . . motion . . . order all proceedings in connection with said appeal terminated. ...Ã¢ÂÂ
Thus we see that initially the appeal is accomplished by merely filing the notice of appeal within five days after rendition of the judgment or order complained of; no papers, however, will be transmitted to the superior court unless a proposed statement is filed within five days after filing the notice of appeal and if it is not so filed Ã¢ÂÂsuch appeal shall be 'deemed abandonedÃ¢ÂÂ. In the case before us, as heretofore noted, the notice of appeal was duly filed and a proposed statement was filed in time. Did the failure to include specified grounds of appeal in the proposed statement fender it ineffectual for any purpose? The answer, as indicated is negative.
Kazama v. Municipal Court, (1935) 10 Cal. App. (2d) 484 [52 Pac. (2d) 489], was a mandamus proceeding by which an appellant sought to compel settlement of a statement on appeal, and is relied on by appellant as authority to the contrary. But in that case the appellant had wholly failed to serve on the respondent a copy of the transcript which *Supp. 764he had attached to his original proposed statement. Since the law required that the proposed statement be both served on the respondent and filed, and since it did not appear from facts alleged that the appeal would have been effectual for any purpose without the transcript, it was held that a demurrer to the petition was properly sustained Ã¢ÂÂfor the reason that facts were not alleged therein which would give petitioner the right to have a statement on appeal settled, either with or without the evidenceÃ¢ÂÂ. The failure to serve the copy of the transcript was Ã¢ÂÂa failure to take procedural steps necessary to invoke appellate jurisdictionÃ¢ÂÂ and, jurisdiction not having been acquired, neither the trial nor appellate court had power to relieve from such jurisdictional default. Here, however,' the appellant failed in no jurisdictionally essential procedural step. He filed his notice of appeal and both served and filed the proposed statement within time. The statement without any grounds of appeal specified was nevertheless a Ã¢ÂÂstatement on appealÃ¢ÂÂ and sufficient to invoke the appellate jurisdiction of the superior court and require it to determine whether as to any ground of appeal urged it appears Ã¢ÂÂto the satisfaction of said Court that the statement fairly and fully presents the evidence and other proceedings necessary for a decision thereonÃ¢ÂÂ, and to consider anv such ground, if found. (Rule 4.)
Ã¢ÂÂ The policy of the law generally favors the hearing of appeals on the merits.Ã¢ÂÂ (Manning v. Gavin, (1939) 14 Cal. (2d) 44 [92 Pac. (2d) 795]; see, also, People v. Megugorac, (1938) 12 Cal. (2d) 208 [82 Pac. (2d) 1108] ; People v. Bryant, (1929) 207 Cal. 450, 452 [278 Pac. 1025].) As was pointed out in People v. Appellate Department of the Superior Court, (1936) 8 Cal. (2d) 56, 60 [63 Pac. (2d) 812], Ã¢ÂÂIn the section as reenacted [and in the rules which now govern] there is no provision that if a statement of the grounds of the appeal be not filed within the time prescribed the appeal shall be ineffectual for any purpose Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ, and it should also be observed that the rules contain no negation of the general power of the court to control or amend its process or records. It is true that section 473 of the Code of Civil Procedure is inapplicable to criminal proceedings (Kazama v. Municipal Court, (1935) 10 Cal. App. (2d) 484, 485 [52 Pac. (2d) 489] ; Gonzales v. Superior Court, (1935) 3 Cal. (2d) 260 [44 Pac. (2d) 320]) but the effect of the courtÃ¢ÂÂs action here was not to relieve the defendant of a default and *Supp. 765thereby recreate or restore to him a right of which he had been foreclosed, but rather, in the exercise of a jurisdiction which existed, to permit defendant to augment or modify a proposed statement which was jurisdictionally competent but not academically complete and which it was the duty of the court to complete and settle and then certify. Laws exist to promote justice; courts of appeal are provided to render justice doubly sure; in making up the record for presentation of a case on appeal the rules we are discussing provide for a final settlement of the statement only after notice to both parties. The object of the notice is to permit them to be present and it would be an incongruous thing to say to them that they could be present and participate in the effort to fully and fairly make up the statement but that the court had no power to include in that statement anything on the suggestion of appellant, which had not been included in his original proposed statement. Even the laws of pleading are not as exacting or inflexible as that and there is no necessity for such a rule. Both parties being present, the respondent can see to it that the record contains all the evidence and matters pertinent to a full presentation of his view of the point. In People v. Megugorac, (1938) 12 Cal. (2d) 208 [82 Pac. (2d) 1108], the defendant had duly given notice of appeal and within five daysÃ¢ÂÂ time filed a statement which omitted Ã¢ÂÂan application designating the portions of the phonographic reporterÃ¢ÂÂs notes necessary to be transcribed to fairly present the points he desired to urge on appeal, as required by section 7, rule II, Rules for the Supreme Court and the several District Courts of Appeal. . . . The designation was supplied some ten days later. . . . None of the parties appear to have suffered any prejudice by the brief delay. Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ The Supreme Court discussed the cases of People v. Lewis, (1933), 219 Cal. 410 [27 Pac. (2d) 73], and People v. Bryant, (1929) supra, 207 Cal. 450 [278 Pac. 1025], pointed out that in the Lewis case its Ã¢ÂÂlanguage should have been confined to the sole question there presented, to-wit, Ã¢ÂÂa tardy notice of appealÃ¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ and followed the principles enunciated in the Bryant case wherein the appellants Ã¢ÂÂdid not file with the clerk and present an application to the trial court which stated in general terms the grounds of appeal and the points upon which the appellants relyÃ¢ÂÂ but notwithstanding which omission it was held that Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ there was a substantial compliance with section 1247 [Penal Code], for it is not disputed that *Supp. 766the record on appeal is sufficient in every respect, excepting the failure on the part of appellants to comply with those particular provisions of section 1247 of the Penal Code which provide that the application filed with the clerk and presented to the trial court should contain a statement in general terms of the grounds of the appeal and the points upon which appellants relyÃ¢ÂÂ. The court further suggested, in People v. Bryant, (1929) supra, 207 Cal. 450, 452, that Ã¢ÂÂThis provision is for the benefit of the appellate court to aid it in deciding the points raised upon appeal, and no one else is prejudiced by the omission in this case.Ã¢ÂÂ Similarly it may be remarked in our ease that no one has been prejudiced by the delay in specification of the grounds of appeal, because, while such specification in an appellantÃ¢ÂÂs proposed statement may be of significance to the trial court and respondent in correcting, augmenting and finally settling the same, it should be sufficient for those purposes that the grounds were disclosed prior to final settlement with reasonable opportunity to the respondent and the court to consider the state of the record in relation thereto.
If there was substantial compliance in the Bryant case with the rule involved therein, then there was substantial compliance in our case with the rule applicable here, and manifestly we cannot hold, under the circumstances shown here, that the trial court either exceeded its jurisdiction or abused its discretion by including in the statement it settled the grounds of appeal claimed by appellant to be pertinent to a fair presentation of the ease.
The order appealed from is affirmed.

I concur in the judgment. I agree with the conclusions of my associates thai the appeal was effective, although the statement on appeal did not contain the grounds of appeal, and that the trial court had jurisdiction to settle the statement. If it was error, therefore, to insert in the statement as settled, grounds of appeal not in it when the statement was proposed, the error was one of procedure, and in view of the fact that we are this day affirming the judgment on the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs appeal, it is apparent that the procedure of which the People complain did not work to their prejudice.

I concur in the judgment. By paragraph numbered (8) of section 42 of the Los Angeles City Charter, it is declared that the city attorney Ã¢ÂÂshall draw complaints for misdemeanors committed against the laws of this stateÃ¢ÂÂ. This measures his power and duty respecting the misdemeanor that is the basis of the present case, plainly does not attempt to make that power exclusive, and hence furnishes no basis for the order appealed from.
Paragraphs numbered 6 and 7 of charter section 42 pro-vide in part: Ã¢ÂÂ(6) The city attorney shall institute ... all criminal eases arising upon violation of the provisions of this charter or the ordinance of the city . . .
Ã¢ÂÂ (7) The city attorney shall draw complaints in such cases ...Ã¢ÂÂ I withhold my judgment on the effect of these charter provisions and the possibility that they do deal with municipal affairs.

This is an appeal by plaintiff from a judgment for defendant in an action by the assignee of a depositor in a building and loan association to recover from the association a sum equal to the difference between interest on his deposits at the rate called for by his certificates and the interest actually paid him at a lesser rate pursuant to a statute enacted during a period of national emergency. The certificates involved herein were all issued prior to March 10, 1933, and each declares that the Ã¢ÂÂprincipal sum shall bear dividends from the date of issue hereof, at the rate of Six Per Cent (6%), per annum, payable QuarterlyÃ¢ÂÂ.
*Supp. 767On March 10, 1933, there became effective the provisions of section 8.09 of the Building and Loan Association Act. (Act 986, DeeringÃ¢ÂÂs Gen. Laws, 1933 Supp.) By the terms of that section Ã¢ÂÂNotwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Act or in any investment certificate or certificate evidencing shares or in any agreement or elsewhere, no association shall hereafter at any time pay, credit, declare or allow any interest, or dividends in excess of the rate of four per cent per year in respect of interest or dividends which shall accrue or be earned during the emergency period (but only during such period) as hereinafter in this section 8.09 defined, upon investment certificates or shares, whether heretofore or hereafter issued. . . . The commissioner is hereby authorized, however, during such emergency period, in the case of any or all associations, to increase such rate to a rate not in excess of five per cent per year, or to decrease such rate or to postpone the time for the payment of such interest or dividends, or any part thereof, or to decrease such rate and to postpone such time of payment, if he shall determine that such increase is reasonably justified in the interest of the certificate holder or shareholders, or is in the public interest, or that such decrease or postponement, or decrease and postponement, is reasonably necessary for the protection of the investment in such association of its certificate holders or shareholders, or is in the public interest.Ã¢ÂÂ  The term Ã¢ÂÂemergency periodÃ¢ÂÂ as used in the section is defined as the period commencing with the effective date of such section (March 10, 1933) and ending September 1, 1935, unless sooner terminated by order of the commissioner as provided for therein. The amendatory act of March 10, 1933, also declared (sec. 10) the intention of the legislature to enact each portion of such act regardless of the constitutionality of any other portion thereof, that it was acting (sec. 11) under Ã¢ÂÂthe police powers of this State in view of the existing emergencyÃ¢ÂÂ, declared the act to be (sec. 12) an urgency measure and stated various Ã¢ÂÂfacts constituting such necessity.Ã¢ÂÂ The facts so stated are ample, prima facie, to constitute a basis for emergency exercise of police powers. In 1935, prior to September 1st, another declaration of public emergency and necessity was made and the period of the emergency was extended to February 1, 1937 (likewise as the former subject to sooner legal termination by the Build*Supp. 768ing and Loan Commissioner). Said section 8.09 requires the giving of a five daysÃ¢ÂÂ notice of any change of interest or dividend rate and contains other provisions which are immaterial to our decision.
Obediently to the directions of the statute, defendant building and loan association subsequent to March 10, 1933, and up to January 26, 1937, when the principal of the certificates was retired by payment in full, paid interest at the reduced rate of 4 per cent per year, except for the period between April 2, 1934, and January 2, 1935, when the rate by order of the commissioner, validly and regularly made if the statute is valid, was 2 per cent per year. It is to recover the difference between the interest so paid and that which would have accrued at 6 per cent per year that this action is brought. The judgment for defendant must be affirmed.
Appellant frankly and eommendably concedes that respondent1 Ã¢ÂÂaptly and succinctlyÃ¢ÂÂ stated the latterÃ¢ÂÂs position in its brief as follows: Ã¢ÂÂThe major premise is that, notwithstanding the constitutional provisions against laws impairing the obligation of contracts, the states, through their legislative bodies may, in the exercise of the police power, pass laws reasonably regulating businesses Ã¢ÂÂ affected with the public interestÃ¢ÂÂ. The minor premise is that the business of a building and loan association is a business Ã¢ÂÂ affected with the public interest Ã¢ÂÂ. The conclusion follows that section 8.09, if reasonable under the police power, is valid and constitutional.Ã¢ÂÂ Appellant, however, says, Ã¢ÂÂGranted that the States may in the exercise of their police power reasonably regulate businesses affected with the public interest; granted that a building and loan association is such a business; it still does not follow that the statute in question is constitutional.Ã¢ÂÂ It is not constitutional, appellant argues because it is not reasonable.
In our view of the case, the major and minor premises above stated being conceded, properly so we believe, we are bound to affirm the judgment because, on the record before us, we cannot say that the regulation is unreasonable. The reduction in interest rate was not permanent during any part of the time involved. The reduction to 4 per cent, required by the statute, was for the period of the emergency only; an emergency was declared to exist; sufficient facts *Supp. 769were recited to constitute an emergency; the commissioner had power to terminate it legally at any time on the occurrence of a factual termination; there is no _ showing or suggestion that the commissioner abused his discretion in not terminating the emergency as a matter of law or in reducing the interest rate temporarily to 2 per cent. We must presume, in the absence of evidence establishing the contrary, that facts existed justifying the commissionerÃ¢ÂÂs order; likewise, since there is no suggestion of evidence showing that the legislative-required reduction in interest rate from 6 per cent to 4 per cent during the emergency period was not reasonable Ã¢ÂÂ we must presume that facts existed which warranted that action.  If it was based on substantial and extraordinary facts and was, with respect to those facts, reasonably calculated and necessary to protect the public welfare, it is not unconstitutional merely because it alters that which was a definite obligation of the contract in the absence of such extraordinary facts.
In Home Building & Loan Assn. v. Blaisdell, (1933) 290 U. S. 398, 428 [54 Sup. Ct. 231, 78 L. ed. 413, 423, 88 A. L. R. 1481], Chief Justice Hughes, speaking for the Supreme Court, said Ã¢ÂÂTo ascertain the scope of the constitutional prohibition we examine the course of judicial decisions in its application. These put it beyond question that the prohibition is not an absolute one and is not to be read with literal exactness like a mathematical formula. . . . (L. ed., pp. 426-7.) Not only is the constitutional provision qualified by the measure of control which the State retains over remedial processes, but the State also continues to possess authority to safeguard the vital interests of its people. It does not matter that legislation appropriate to that end Ã¢ÂÂhas the result of modifying or abrogating contracts already in effectÃ¢ÂÂ. (Stephenson v. Binford, 287 U. S. 251, 276 [53 Sup. Ct. 181, 77 L. ed. 288, 301, 87 A. L. R. 721].) Not only are existing laws read into contracts in order to fix obligations as between the parties, but the reservation of essential attributes of sovereign power is also read into contracts as a postulate of the legal order. . . . (L. ed., p. 428.) The economic interests of the State may justify the exercise of its continuing and dominant protective power notwithstanding interference with contracts. . . . (L. ed. 429.) The question is not whether the legis*Supp. 770lative action affects contracts incidentally, or directly or indirectly, but whether the legislation is addressed to a legitimate end and the measures taken are reasonable and appropriate to that end.Ã¢ÂÂ
While it may be urged that the Minnesota statute involved in the Blaisdell case left to the creditor a possibility that he might ultimately recover the face value of his contract while our statute, although operating only on dividends accruing during a temporary period is permanent in its effect on those dividends, we find nothing in that factual difference (if inherently it be such) which alters the controlling legal principle. That principle is that, as expressed in one of the public utility rate cases cited in the Blaisdell case (at p. 429, L. ed.; Union Dry Goods Co. v. Georgia Pub. Serv. Corp., (1919) 248 U. S. 372 [39 Sup. Ct. 117, 63 L. ed. 309, at 312, 9 A. L. R. 1420, P. U. R 1919C, 60]), Ã¢ÂÂthe right of private contract must yield to the exigencies of the public welfare when determined in an appropriate manner by the authority of the state.Ã¢ÂÂ The case most factually similar to ours, so far as our research has led us, is that of Holland v. Nakdimen, (1928) 177 Ark. 920 [9 S. W. (2d) 307, 62 A. L. R. 484], wherein the court held that a subsequently enacted statute fixing the maximum rate of interest to be paid by banks on savings accounts was valid and effective on obligations previously contracted. That court said (pages 488, 489, 62 A. L. R.): Ã¢ÂÂFinally, it is insisted that the act under consideration went into effect March 7, 1927, and that in so far as the plaintiff, Mrs. C. C. Scott, is concerned, it would violate a contract which the bank had previously made with her to pay her 4% per cent, on time deposits until June 30, 1927. When Mrs. Scott and the bank made this contract, they knew that the regulation and control of banks came under the internal police power of the state, and that this contract must be subject to all laws then in force or which might thereafter be passed.Ã¢ÂÂ The business of a building and loan association has the same inherent qualities and characteristics in relationship to the public which bring a bank within the regulatory scope of the police power of a state. (North American Building etc. Assn. v. Richardson, (1936) 6 Cal. (2d) 90, 101 [56 Pac. (2d) 1221].)
The ably presented argument of appellant is not unlike the strong, but unavailing dissent of Mr. Justice Sutherland in *Supp. 771the Blaisdell case. (Home Building & Loan Assn. v. Blaisdell, (1933) 290 U. S. 398 [54 Sup. Ct. 231, 78 L. ed. 413, 88 A. L. R. 1481].) At page 446 L. ed. with respect to the case of Edwards v. Kearzey, 96 U. S. 595 [24 L. ed. 793], relative to a provision of the North Carolina Constitution of 1868 increasing the exemptions to which a debtor was entitled, Justice Sutherland said: Ã¢ÂÂThis court . . . reviewed the history of the adoption of the contract impairment clause and held the state constitutional provision invalid. 1 Ã¢ÂÂPolicy and humanityÃ¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ it said, Ã¢ÂÂare dangerous guides in the discussion of a legal proposition. He who follows them far is apt to bring back the means of error and delusion. The prohibition contains no qualification, and we have no judicial authority to interpolate any.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ The accuracy of the cold logic of Justice Sutherland need not be questioned but it has yielded, at least in matters such as that now before us, to Ã¢ÂÂpolicy and humanityÃ¢ÂÂ as exemplified in the less stern and more modern rule enunciated by the majority through Chief Justice Hughes.
The case of Treigle v. Acme Homestead Assn., (1935) 297 U. S. 189 [56 Sup. Ct. 408] 80 L. ed. 575, 101 A. L. R. 1284], so strongly relied on by appellant as Ã¢ÂÂalmost identicalÃ¢ÂÂ with the ease at bar is actually not in point. At page 579 (L. ed.) the court says of the Louisiana statute there under discussion: Ã¢ÂÂIt does not purport to deal with any existing emergency and the provisions respecting the rights of withdrawing members are neither temporary nor conditional. . . . (p. 580, L. ed.) The provision is comparable to a statute declaring that whereas preferred stockholders heretofore have enjoyed a priority in the distribution of assets, in that respect they shall hereafter stand pari passu with common stockholders. . . . The statute merely attempts, for no discernible public purpose, the abrogation of contracts between members and the association lawful when made.Ã¢ÂÂ
Appellant asserts Ã¢ÂÂNo single authority cited by respondent purports to legalize the permanent, arbitrary, cancellation of property rights dependent on a legal contract made before the statute went into effect.Ã¢ÂÂ That statement may be fully conceded; but it is inappropriate because in the ease at bar, as hereinbefore made apparent, the alteration of the contract right was neither permanent, in the sense of continuing its *Supp. 772effect on contract rights accruing after the period of emergency, nor (presumptively) arbitrary.
It would serve no useful purpose to discuss the many other authorities cited by counsel for the respective parties. None of them add measurably to the propositions of law declared in Home Building & Loan Assn. v. Blaisdell, supra, and the authorities therein cited or hereinabove discussed, upon which we rest our conclusions, and none of them overcome those propositions or hold them inapplicable to a situation such as that to which we apply them.
The judgment is affirmed, respondent to recover its costs of appeal.

Defendant appeals from a judgment of conviction of violation of section 237, Vehicle Code. All of the evidence upon which the conviction is based was presented by stipulation. From such stipulated facts, it appears that at the time of defendantÃ¢ÂÂs arrest, 6 May 1939, he was operating his automobile on a public highway in the city of Los Angeles and that at that time there was displayed in the automobile, as required by the Vehicle Code, a certificate of registration for the year 1939, bearing the number 8A-57-49 *Supp. 769and that attached to the automobile were license plates, issued for it in 1938, and bearing the number IT-61-39. Because defendant did not display 1939 license plates bearing the number conforming to the 1939 registration, he was arrested, charged, convicted and sentenced.
It further appears that defendantÃ¢ÂÂs application for 1939 registration and license plates was seasonably made (23 January), that he then paid the full amount of the registration fee and vehicle tax and that the division of motor vehicles of the state in a few days forwarded to defendant the certificate of registration which was properly displayed in his car at the time of his arrest and certain proposed license plates bearing the identifying number shown on the certificate and also bearing the words Ã¢ÂÂCalifornia WorldÃ¢ÂÂs Fair Ã¢ÂÂ39.Ã¢ÂÂ Immediately upon receipt of such plates defendant returned them to the division of motor vehicles, stating that they were not acceptable to him, that they did not bear the inscription required by section 156 of the Vehicle Code, that he did not wish to display advertising on his automobile without compensation and demanding that plates be issued to him without the advertising matter thereon. The division of motor vehicles declined to issue or provide defendant with any plates other than those originally tendered.
The foregoing stipulated facts not only fail to support defendantÃ¢ÂÂs conviction but require that he be adjudged not guilty.
Section 237 of the Vehicle Code makes it unlawful to operate a motor vehicle on a highway only Ã¢ÂÂunless there shall be attached thereto and displayed thereon when and as required by this code a valid registration card and license plate or plates issued therefor by the department for the current registration year.Ã¢ÂÂ Section 160 of the same code requires that application for renewal of annual registration of a vehicle shall be made, and the fee therefor paid, between January 1st and February 4th, succeeding expiration of the preceding registration, and section 161 provides that Ã¢ÂÂWhen application for renewal of registration . . . has been made as required in section 160 hereof, such vehicle may be operated on the highways until the new license plate or plates have been received from the department upon condition that there be displayed on such vehicle the license plate or plates issued to such vehicle for the previous year.Ã¢ÂÂ Section 164 provides *Supp. 770that upon renewing a registration the department Ã¢ÂÂshall issue a new registration card and license plate or plates to the owner as upon an original registration. Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ
It will be remembered that section 237, above quoted from, and which defendant has been found guilty of violating, in so far as it is pertinent here, predicates the offense only on failure to display license plates Ã¢ÂÂwhen and as required by this code.Ã¢ÂÂ The license plates so required by the code are described in section 156 (b) as follows: Ã¢ÂÂEvery license plate shall have displayed upon it the registration number assigned to the vehicle for which it is issued, together with the word Ã¢ÂÂCaliforniaÃ¢ÂÂ or the abbreviation Ã¢ÂÂCal.Ã¢ÂÂ and the year number for which it is issued.Ã¢ÂÂ There is nothing in the slightest degree uncertain or ambiguous in the foregoing language prescribing what shall be shown on the license plates. That language is obviously both inclusive and exclusive and it applies to every license plate. The department of motor vehicles had no more authority or right to require defendant to display, with or without compensation, a license plate advertising the California WorldÃ¢ÂÂs Pair than it had to compel him to carry a banner or make oral speeches advertising the fair, the climate, prunes, oranges or a political party. It was clearly the duty of the department to furnish defendant with license plates Ã¢ÂÂas required by this codeÃ¢ÂÂ and he could not be compelled to display unauthorized plates. To hold otherwise would be to authorize the taking of his property without due process of law and would countenance an unwarranted invasion of his personal liberty.
While awaiting the receipt of proper plates defendant, exactly as required by the statute, displayed the plates issued to his vehicle for the preceding year. Thus, instead of proving a violation of the law, the stipulated facts, as above stated, show that defendant fully complied with it.
The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded to the municipal court with directions to enter a judgment of not guilty.
Shaw, P. J., and Bishop, J., concurred.

This litigation is based on a bond that was given to procure the issuance of a writ of attachment in an action which was brought by the Advance Auto Body Works, Inc., against the KMTR Radio Station as well as against plaintiff here, Willard Fonda, and others. Attachment was levied on an automobile truck claimed by Fonda and a radio broadcasting station, KIIQ, which was built into the truck and which station was owned by the KMTR corporation. Judgment in that action went for the plaintiff therein against the KMTR corporation but against that plaintiff in favor of *Supp. 830Fonda, who is plaintiff here. The truck and broadcasting station were held under attachment from 29 October 1936 to 21 April 1937 and Fonda brought this action on the attachment bond for damages for loss of use of his truck.  In defense defendant offered to prove, in substance, that the truck and radio station were so combined that the one was an integral part of the other and that they could not be separated without injury to the unit. The offer was rejected, judgment went for plaintiff and defendant appeals. The judgment must be reversed.
Sections 1025 and 1026 of the Civil Code provide, respectively, in material parts, that Ã¢ÂÂWhen things belonging to different owners have been united so as to form a single thing, and cannot be separated without injury, the whole belongs to the owner of the thing which forms the principal partÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ and Ã¢ÂÂThat part is to be deemed the principal to which the other has been united only for the use, ornament, or completion of the former.Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ Obviously the radio station does not contribute to the Ã¢ÂÂuse, ornament, or completionÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ of the truck but the truck does add to the use and completion of the radio transmitter as a portable unit. The truck, therefore, if it was a part of the radio station, as could have been found if the proffered evidence had been received, was subject to attachment in the action against the KMTK. corporation. This would be true even if the truck and radio transmitter were to be regarded as jointly owned. (7 C. J. S. 260; Veach v. Adams, (1877) 51 Cal. 609, 612 ;Conolley v. Power, (1924) 70 Cal. App. 70, 76 [232 Pac. 744].)
The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded to the municipal court for a new trial, appellant to recover its costs of appeal.

Defendant appeals from a judgment of conviction of violating paragraph 1 of subsection (e) of section- 476 of the Vehicle Code of California, which in material part reads as follows: Ã¢ÂÂWhenever traffic is controlled by official traffic control signals exhibiting the words Ã¢ÂÂGo,Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂCaution, Ã¢ÂÂ or Ã¢ÂÂStop,Ã¢ÂÂ or exhibiting different colored lights successively, the following colors only shall be used, and said terms and lights shall indicate as follows:
Ã¢ÂÂ(e) Red alone or Ã¢ÂÂStopÃ¢ÂÂ.
Ã¢ÂÂ1. Vehicular traffic facing the signal shall stop before entering the nearest crosswalk at an intersection or at such other point as may be indicated by a clearly visible line, and shall remain standing until green or Ã¢ÂÂGoÃ¢ÂÂ is showm alone. . Ã¢ÂÂ
The evidence shows that defendant, on the occasion in question, was acting as a motorman operating a street ear on tracks on a public highway in the city of Los Angeles and that his car was so operated in an easterly direction on Seventh Street that it entered the intersection of Towne Avenue while a traffic signal on the southwest corner thereof showed the word Ã¢ÂÂStopÃ¢ÂÂ.
Defendant moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the law he was charged with violating was not applicable to motormen operating street cars. Subsection (e) of said section 476 expressly provides that Ã¢ÂÂThe motorman of any street car shall obey all official traffic signals as applicable to vehicles ...Ã¢ÂÂ (with an exception not material to this *Supp. 833case). We hold that such law is applicable to motormen operating street cars and that the motion was properly denied. During the trial, however, an error oÃÂ£ law occurred which entitles the defendant to a new trial.
We do not regard the provisions of paragraph 1, subsection (c), section 476, Vehicle Code (above quoted), as stating a rule absolute under all circumstances. Subsection (ÃÂ£) of said section, itself, provides that Ã¢ÂÂNo person shall disobey the directions of this section except when it is necessary for the purpose of avoiding a collision or in case of other emergency . . . ,Ã¢ÂÂ thereby disclosing an intent to establish a rule which could be obeyed within reason but which did not call for inexorable compliance regardless of circumstances. An emergency is not necessarily something wholly unexpected; according to WebsterÃ¢ÂÂs New International Dictionary (1930) it may also comprehend a pressing necessity or exigency. In 20 C. J., at p. 499, we find it defined as Ã¢ÂÂAny event or occasional combination of circumstances which calls for immediate action or remedy; . . . a perplexing contingency or complication of circumstances. Ã¢ÂÂ  It was error, under the circumstances disclosed in the record of this case, to sustain objections to questions asked on cross-examination of the PeopleÃ¢ÂÂs principal witness and which questions bore directly on the issue as to -whether defendantÃ¢ÂÂs conduct in the premises was Avillfully in violation of the law or Avas legally justified by an Ã¢ÂÂemergencyÃ¢ÂÂ, within the meaning of the statute.
We are strengthened in our construction of the Ã¢ÂÂemergencyÃ¢ÂÂ clause of the statute as being applicable here by the following considerations. AVhere official traffic signals have ÃÂ­avo signs onlyÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂStopÃ¢ÂÂ and Ã¢ÂÂGoÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂAvith no preliminary Avarnings of change, strict compliance AArith the letter of the law in every instance (disregarding the emergency clause) would be almost impossible of achievement and tona fide efforts to attain such compliance -would tend to defeat one of the principal purposes of the Ioav. Traffic signals are not installed to retard trafficÃ¢ÂÂon the contrary their principal purpose, along Avith promoting safety for users of highways generally, is to expedite traffic movement. So important is the flow of traffic that Vehicle Code section 511.7 provides that Ã¢ÂÂLocal authorities in timing traffic signals may so regulate the timing thereof as to permit the movement of traffic in an orderly and safe manner at speeds slightly at variance from the *Supp. 834speed otherwise applicable within the district or at intersections under this code.Ã¢ÂÂ A signal-marked intersection with a prima facie lawful crossing speed of 15 or perhaps 25 miles per hour, according to the district in which located, could never be approached safely at any such speed if the operator of the vehicle were under the absolute necessity, with penal sanction, of stopping, in any event whatsoever whenever the signal changed to show Ã¢ÂÂStopÃ¢ÂÂ, Ã¢ÂÂbefore entering the nearest crosswalk . . . [to] remain standing until green or Ã¢ÂÂGoÃ¢ÂÂ is shown alone. Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ Such an interpretation of the law would make every signal-marked intersection of every street a Ã¢ÂÂboulevard stopÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂevery Ã¢ÂÂGoÃ¢ÂÂ signal would be first a stop signal; the flow of traffic would be but spasmodic drippings.
Operators in attempting in good faith to comply with such an unreasonable construction of the law would be menaced by the provisions of section 514 of the same code, requiring that Ã¢ÂÂNo person shall drive upon a highway at such a slow speed as to impede or block the normal and reasonable movement of traffic ...Ã¢ÂÂ
Further provisions of said section 476 disclose legislative recognition of the fact that it would be impracticable to require a vehicle absolutely to stop under all circumstances on a change of signal. Subsection (b) of the cited section permits the use of the word Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ CautionÃ¢ÂÂ and a yellow light on traffic signals and makes the following rules applicable when such yellow light or caution signal is displayed (Vehicle Code, sec. 476 [b] [1]) :
Ã¢ÂÂVehicular traffic facing the signal shall stop before entering the nearest crosswalk at the intersection or at a marked line, but if such stop cannot be made in safety a vehicle may be driven cautiously through the intersection or past such signal.Ã¢ÂÂ There is no more reason for recognizing the physical fact that a moving vehicle requires time and space in which to change its inertia from motion to repose when confronted with a yellow light than there is when it faces a red light. In either case the duty to stop is imperative unless the circumstances depicted by subsection (b) (1) or by subsection (f), are present. Since in the instant case the traffic signals involved did not include the yellow or Ã¢ÂÂCautionÃ¢ÂÂ signal the provisions of said subsection (b) (1) are inapplicable and defendant must justify his conduct, if at all, under the Ã¢ÂÂemergencyÃ¢ÂÂ clause of subsection (f).
*Supp. 835Certainly a bona fide effort must be made, and reasonable care used, to comply with the law in every instance. But when a person operating a vehicle is approaching an intersection at a speed which is otherwise lawful under all extant circumstances (see Vehicle Code, sec. 511) and when the signal, without preliminary warning, changes from Ã¢ÂÂGoÃ¢ÂÂ to Ã¢ÂÂStopÃ¢ÂÂ while the vehicle is so close to the crosswalk line that it is physically impossible to stop it before crossing that line, the operator is entitled, if charged with a violation of the law, as was the defendant here, to show the circumstances under which he proceeded, in order that it may be determined as a fact whether the Ã¢ÂÂemergencyÃ¢ÂÂ contemplated by the law existed. The objections to the three questions addressed to the witness Fujiki inquiring concerning the weather, the speed of the street car when the witness first saw it (while it was opposite the center of a safety zone) and its speed at the time the signal changed (the position of the ear at that time, according to later adduced testimony of the witness Ashworth, being approximately 10 feet west of the signal) were improperly interposed and should have been overruled.
The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded to the municipal court for a new trial.
Shaw, P. J., concurred.

The evidence establishes that for a fee plaintiff purchased a license to park her automobile on land owned and maintained by defendant for the purpose of affording convenient parking space to its patrons. For the fee she was permitted to and did drive her car onto defendantÃ¢ÂÂs land, park it, lock it and leave it while she was temporarily on another part of defendantÃ¢ÂÂs premises attending a horse racing event. During plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs absence from her car while it was so parked it was removed and many of its parts and accessories were stolen. Plaintiff sued defendant and recovered judgment on the theory that a contract of bailment was breached and that the bailee was responsible to the bailor on the principles enunciated in U Drive, etc., v. System Auto *Supp. 842Parks, (1937) 28 Cal. App. (2d) (Supp.) 782 [71 Pac. (2d) 354]. Defendant appeals and the judgment must be reversed because the evidence is not sufficient to establish that a bailment was created.
The parking area apparently was enclosed and at the entry plaintiff was required to pay the fee and she received a ticket reading, in part, Ã¢ÂÂAUTO PARK This Ticket LICENSES the Holder to Park ONE AUTOMOBILE in This Area LOCK TOUR CAR The Management hereby declares itself NOT RESPONSIBLE for Theft, Fire, or damage to any Car or Article left in sameÃ¢ÂÂ. Defendant did not take possession of plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs car; the keys to it were retained by plaintiff and she was at all times entitled to remove it without surrendering the parking ticket or identifying herself as the owner of the vehicle.
Under the circumstances depicted a contract of bailment is not shown. The mere fact that an automobile was locked and the keys retained by the owner would not necessarily preclude a finding that a contract of bailment existed; locked trunks and other objects are commonly deposited for safekeeping and the bailment of Ã¢ÂÂfastenedÃ¢ÂÂ articles is recognized in section 1835 of the Civil Code. But in order to constitute a bailment, possession of the article must be given the bailee (8 C. J. S. 248, 249; see, also, Civ. Code, secs. 1814, 1815); he cannot be responsible for redelivering that which has not been delivered to him.  Since here the plaintiff reserved at all times possession of the car in herself, defendant acquiring no dominion over the vehicle nor any right to control removal of it, there was no bailment.  Plaintiff, for the fee, acquired a mere license to park her car on defendantÃ¢ÂÂs premises. Defendant assumed no responsibility for safe-keeping such car and is not liable for its theft or damage. Upon a quite similar state of facts the Supreme Court of Alabama reached the same conclusion. (Ex parte Mobile Light & R. R. Co., (1924) 211 Ala. 525 [101 So. 177, 34 A. L. R. 921]; see, also, annotation and cases reviewed in 34 A. L. R. at 925 et seq.)

THE COURT.
Plaintiff sued defendants in the Municipal Court on an open book account for medical services rendered. The defendant Martin Seiveno thereafter filed his petition in bankruptcy, listing this debt, was adjudged a bankrupt and thereafter duly obtained his discharge. Subsequently plaintiff took default judgment in the suit against both the defendants. More than one year after the bankrupt Martin Seiveno was discharged from his debts he made a motion in the Municipal Court for an order directing that the judgment be cancelled and discharged of record as to him pursuant to section 675b, Code of Civil Procedure. From an order refusing to grant such discharge he appeals.
Our attention is called by respondent to the case of Revere Copper Company v. Dimock, 90 N. Y. 33, affirmed in Dimock v. Revere Copper Co., 117 U. S. 559 [6 Sup. Ct. 855, 29 L. Ed. 994], What was there involved was the construction of section 1268 of the New York Code of Civil Procedure which then, in so far as we need here refer to it reads:
Ã¢ÂÂDISCHARGE OF A JUDGMENT AGAINST A BANKRUPT. At any time after two years have elapsed, since a bankrupt was discharged from his debts, pursuant to the acts of Congress relating to bankruptcy, he may apply, upon proof of his discharge, to the court in which a judgment was rendered against him, for an order, directing the judgment to be cancelled and discharged of record. ""If it appears that he has been discharged from the payment of that judgment, an order must be made accordingly; and thereupon the clerk must cancel and discharge the docket thereof, as if the proper satisfaction-piece of the judgment was filed.Ã¢ÂÂ
It was held that this statute only applied to judgments that had been entered prior to the discharge. As to any action pending but not reduced to judgment prior to the discharge or action brought on a debt discharged, subsequent thereto, it would be necessary for the defendant to plead the discharge and, he not having done so, the defense would have been waived and the judgment could not be cancelled. Subsequently the New York statute was amended. The amendment involved inter alia the deletion therefrom of the words:
Ã¢ÂÂIf it appears that he has been discharged from the payment of that judgment. ...Ã¢ÂÂ and substituting therefore the words:
*Supp. 961Ã¢ÂÂ1 If it appears upon the hearing that he has been discharged from the payment of that judgment or the debt upon which such judgment was recovered ...Ã¢ÂÂ
In construing the amended statute the New York Court of Appeals in Walker v. Muir, 194 N. Y. 420, 87 N. E. 680, said:
Ã¢ÂÂWhen we consider the phraseology of the amended section in connection with the decisions prior to 1899, it is apparent that the only purpose for which the legislature could have thus amended the statute was to provide a summary method of canceling judgments obtained after, as well as before, a discharge in bankruptcy.Ã¢ÂÂ (Italics ours.)
Our statute (sec. 675b, Code Civ. Proc.) is substantially identical with the New York statute as so amended and was in all probability suggested by it. The facts in the instant case are indistinguishable from the facts involved in Walker v. Muir, supra, and it was said in Rukeyser v. Tostevin, 188 App. Div. 629 [177 N. Y. Supp. 291, 292] :
Ã¢ÂÂThere can be no doubt that section 1268 (New York Code of Civil Procedure) applies to the case under consideration, and that it is mandatory upon the court to grant an' order canceling and discharging the judgment of record where it appears that the debt upon which the judgment was recovered had been discharged.Ã¢ÂÂ
 We think that our section 675b, Code of Civil Procedure, is mandatory, from which it follows that the trial court should have granted the motion and entered an order that the judgment be cancelled and discharged of record.
The order appealed from is reversed and the municipal court is directed to grant the motion and make and enter an order that the judgment be cancelled and discharged of record.

SHAW, P. J.
Defendant drove past a mechanically operated traffic control signal erected and operated by the City of Los Angeles in a public street of the city, at a time when the semaphore arm thereof purporting to control his motion directed him to Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ Stop Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ. This is made a misdemeanor by the Vehicle Code, unless the facts relied on by defendant relieve him from the charge. These facts are: that the Los Angeles city officials in charge and control of this signal had *Supp. 963determined that it should be operated for only a part of each day, and should not be in operation at the time when defendant drove past it; that the operation of the signal was controlled by an electric clock and deviations from its established schedule Ã¢ÂÂcan be attributed only to some mechanical defect or irregularity in the control mechanismÃ¢ÂÂ; and that it was in fact in operation when defendant drove past it, although it had been inspected and found in good order about two weeks before. Upon these facts the judgment of conviction must be reversed.
Section 476 of the Vehicle Code contains these provisions pertinent to the present ease: Ã¢ÂÂWhenever traffic is controlled by official traffic control signals exhibiting the words Ã¢ÂÂGo,Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂCaution,Ã¢ÂÂ or Ã¢ÂÂStop,Ã¢ÂÂ or exhibiting different colored lights successively, the following colors only shall be used, and said terms and lights shall indicate as follows :Ã¢ÂÂ . . . (c) Eed alone or Ã¢ÂÂStop.Ã¢ÂÂ 1. Vehicular traffic facing the signal shall stop before entering the nearest crosswalk at an intersection or at such other point as may be indicated by a clearly visible line, and shall remain standing until green or Ã¢ÂÂ Go Ã¢ÂÂ is shown alone, except as provided in the next succeeding paragraph. . . . (f) No person shall disobey the directions of this section except when it is necessary for the purpose of avoiding a collision or in case of other emergency or when otherwise directed by a police or traffic officer, or as permitted under section 454.Ã¢ÂÂ Section 475 of the Vehicle Code provides: Ã¢ÂÂThe driver of any vehicle, the person in charge of any animal, any pedestrian, and the motorman of any street car shall obey the instructions of any official traffic signal applicable to him and placed as provided by law, unless otherwise directed by a police or traffic officer, subject to the exemptions granted by section 454.Ã¢ÂÂ
Undoubtedly these two sections, which were both added to the code in 1939, by the same amendment, are expressions of the same legislative purpose, and must be construed together and, so far as reasonably possible, in harmony with each other.
No complaint is made and no specification of insufficiency of the evidence is directed to the proposition that this signal was not an Ã¢ÂÂofficial traffic control signal,Ã¢ÂÂ placed and maintained by local authorities under section 465, Vehicle Code, which authorizes such signals to be so placed and main*Supp. 964tained, and we therefore proceed on the assumption that it was. No emergency appears, nor any other circumstance which, under the terms of subdivision (f) of section 476, would excuse defendantÃ¢ÂÂs failure to stop. Notwithstanding that fact, however, we think the defendant committed no offense when he passed the signal. Section 459 of the Vehicle Code, provides that Ã¢ÂÂThe provisions of this division [which .includes sections 475 and 476] shall not prevent local authorities within the reasonable exercise of the police power from adopting rules and regulations by ordinance or resolution on the following matters: . . . (d) Regulating traffic by means of semaphores or other traffic control signaling devices.Ã¢ÂÂ Here the local authorities have done just what is thus permitted, and the effect of their regulations is that at the time defendant drove past this signal it should not be operating or regulating traffic. When the legislature left this power to the local authorities, it cannot reasonably have meant in the same breath to say that the movements of such signals should control traffic at a time when the authorities installing them direct otherwise. Such provision would in effect be a delegation directly to the mechanical device of the power to regulate traffic. While the delegation of fact finding or even discretionary power to officials is often upheld on the ground that they may be expected to apply intelligence to the exercise of such power, we know of no reason for holding that a like delegation to a mere machine would be valid.  Better is it, since all laws must have a reasonable interpretation, so to construe the legislation in question as not to impute to it the delegative intent last mentioned, and this construction we adopt, holding that, in the words of section 475, Vehicle Code, the Ã¢ÂÂinstructionsÃ¢ÂÂ of signals are not Ã¢ÂÂapplicable toÃ¢ÂÂ a traveller, and that, in the words of section 476, Vehicle Code, traffic is not Ã¢ÂÂ.Ã¢ÂÂcontrolled byÃ¢ÂÂ signals, when back of the instructions of those signals there stands no legitimizing command of the local authority by which they were erected.
The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded to the municipal court for a new trial.

Plaintiff and appellant filed suit against defendant for damages alleged to have been sustained by plaintiff as a result of the negligent operation by defendant of an automobile which he was driving. As counsel for respondent correctly states: Ã¢ÂÂThe sole question before this court is whether or not service can be effected under Sec. 404 of the California Vehicle Code, St. 1935, p. 154, where the defendant, a non-resident of California, was (1) a minor at the time of the collision, and (2) without the United States at the time service was attempted.Ã¢ÂÂ
The requirements of that section of the Vehicle Code appear to have been fully complied with by personal service on the defendant at Quebec, Canada, by a fully qualified officer. Nevertheless, defendant's motion to quash upon the ground that the service made did not comply with section 404 (e) of the Code was granted by the lower court.
Respondent urges in support of the ruling of that court that the service having been made outside the territorial boundaries of the United States was void. In support of this position defendantÃ¢ÂÂs counsel cite the New York case of Scott v. Dickerson, 169 Misc. 1047 [8 N. Y. Supp. (2d) 656, 657]. That case obviously is not in point. The statute there involved provided for service on the nonresident by an attorney Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ qualified to practice in the state Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ where such service was made. Hence the New York court held in effect that by clear implication service in a foreign jurisdiction was not authorized under the language of the statute. Our Vehicle Code provides, it will be noted, for service Ã¢ÂÂin the State or jurisdiction where the defendant is found.Ã¢ÂÂ
Respondent also contends in support of the ruling of the lower court that service on a nonresident motorist under the section involved is invalid when the defendant is a minor. In support of this contention respondent cites section 33 of the California Civil Code. That section provides that a minor cannot give a delegation of power. In answer to respondentÃ¢ÂÂs contention appellant cites the New York case of Gesell v. Wells, 229 App. Div. 11 [240 N. Y. Supp. 628, 631], which was affirmed by the Court of Appeals, 254 N. Y. 604 [173 N. E. 885]. The New York Supreme Court held that the provision for service on a nonresident was enacted under *Supp. 853the police power of the state and that the provision was one reasonably calculated to promote care and accountability on the part of all who used the highways of that state for the operation of dangerous machines, such as motor vehicles. As the court further said:
1 Ã¢ÂÂ Surely they are not less dangerous in the hands of minors. It is inconceivable that there should have been any legislative intent to exclude minors. But it is urged that the statute in question is based upon an implied agreement which, in the case of an infant, may be repudiated at his election. It would be strange if a police regulation of the state could be thus evaded.Ã¢ÂÂ
Respondent attempts to distinguish this case on the ground that in New York a minorÃ¢ÂÂs delegation of power is voidable, whereas in California it is void. It is true that such is the general rule in this state when the minor himself attempts to delegate power as by the appointment of an attorney in fact. But the situation here presented does not involve a voluntary appointment by a minor. The law has made the appointment and the defendant by using the highways of the state has, under the express terms of subdivision (b) of section 404 of the Vehicle Code, signified his acquiescence in such appointment. Surely the minor may not thereafter be permitted to deny the validity of the appointment. It would be as reasonable to contend that when a court appointed a guardian ad litem for a minor when he was sued the minor could thereafter repudiate the appointment.
The order of the lower court is reversed.

SHAW, P. J.
This appeal is presented to us upon the judgment roll, without either bill of exceptions or transcript. Hence we cannot consider, in deciding it, the references made by appellant to the testimony or to a Ã¢ÂÂstipulationÃ¢ÂÂ of defendant, or to other asserted facts of the case not appearing in the findings or from the admissions of the pleadings. Thus the frequently mentioned fact, if it be a fact, that the employees in question here are instructors is not before us. Statements of the facts of the ease in this opinion are taken from the findings.
The case arises under a statute adopted in 1935 (Stats. 1935, p. 1226). This statute was amended and named Ã¢ÂÂUnemployment Reserves ActÃ¢ÂÂ in 1937. (Stats. 1937, pp. 2052 et seq.) In 1939 it was renamed Ã¢ÂÂUnemployment Insurance ActÃ¢ÂÂ (Stats. 1939, p. 1969) and further amended; but as this case arose before the 1939 amendments they do not require consideration here. The act appears in DeeringÃ¢ÂÂs General Laws, 1937 edition, and in the 1935 and 1939 supplements to that compilation, as Act 8780cL By the terms of this statute certain Ã¢ÂÂcontributionsÃ¢ÂÂ, as they are denominated, are levied upon employers, the amounts of which are based upon the amounts of Ã¢ÂÂwagesÃ¢ÂÂ paid by such employers (sec. 37 et seq.), and similar contributions, likewise computed upon the amount of Ã¢ÂÂwagesÃ¢ÂÂ, are required of employees, which the employers must deduct from wages paid (sec. 44), and the employers are required to pay all these contributions into an unemployment fund. This fund is under the control of the commission which is plaintiff herein and is to be used to pay to unemployed persons certain Ã¢ÂÂbenefitsÃ¢ÂÂ which are likewise computed upon the amount of Ã¢ÂÂwagesÃ¢ÂÂ they have received. (See. 58.) If any employer fails to pay his own contributions, or to deduct and pay those of his employees, this commission may bring action against him therefor. (Sec. 45.)
This is such an action, and it appears from the findings that the defendant is an educational institution emphasizing military instruction, with 150 cadets ranging in age from 6 to 18 years, and (inferentially, though it is not expressly *Supp. 871so stated) that they board and lodge upon defendantÃ¢ÂÂs premises. Defendant Ã¢ÂÂrequires certain of its employees, for reasons of supervision and discipline Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ, to eat meals and lodge with the cadets, the meals and lodging being furnished by defendant. Some of the board and lodging so furnished during the time covered by the action was not considered or reported by the defendant in deducting and paying contributions under the statute above mentioned.  In support of this action the plaintiff now claims that such unreported board and lodging were in fact wages and hence the defendant is liable to make the payments sued for in respect to the value thereof. The trial court found that board and lodging were furnished as above stated during 1937 and parts of 1936 and 1938, that $684.72 became due from defendant thereon and that it had paid all but $491.75, for which judgment was rendered. We hold that this judgment was based on correct legal principles and must be affirmed.
There was no express agreement that the board and lodging were to be a part of the employeesÃ¢ÂÂ compensation, but these employees were required by their contracts to Ã¢ÂÂacceptÃ¢ÂÂ them and were Ã¢ÂÂon duty while eating their mealsÃ¢ÂÂ and Ã¢ÂÂsubject to call at all times while receiving the lodgingÃ¢ÂÂ. Defendant had other employees who did not receive board or lodging and the cash wages were the same in both cases Ã¢ÂÂfor the same kind and amount of work performedÃ¢ÂÂ, but these other employees were not on duty or on call for supervision and discipline as were those who did receive board and lodging.
Section 11 of the act above mentioned defines the term Ã¢ÂÂwagesÃ¢ÂÂ. As first enacted in 1935, the definition was: Ã¢ÂÂthe amount of money received as compensation for the service rendered, including commissions and bonuses and the reasonable value of board, rent, housing, lodging or similar advantage received from the employerÃ¢ÂÂ. The 1937 amendment defined Ã¢ÂÂwagesÃ¢ÂÂ to mean Ã¢ÂÂall remuneration payable for personal services, including commissions and bonuses and the cash value of all remuneration payable in any medium other than cashÃ¢ÂÂ. We cannot ascertain from the findings when the contributions for which judgment was rendered accrued and hence cannot determine whether both or only one of the above quoted definitions must be applied to them. This, however, does not affect our decision, for as far as these definÃÂ­*Supp. 872tions affect the present case, we see no substantial difference between them. Either is entirely adequate to include without any doubt meals and lodging furnished by the employer to the employee in return for services rendered.
DefendantÃ¢ÂÂs claim is that the meals and lodging were furnished and consumed merely for the convenience of the employer and hence are not to be reckoned as part of the wages paid. Judicial decisions and administrative rulings are cited to us by the defendant in which this so-called Ã¢ÂÂconvenience ruleÃ¢ÂÂ is followed in applying income tax laws. In some of these eases the facts are not so far from those here as to indicate any certain ground for distinguishing them; but, nevertheless, we prefer not to follow them.  The income tax law is purely a revenue measure, and upon the rule of strict construction applied to such laws, its scope may well be restrained to such matters as are clearly covered by it.  Here we have a statute which, while it requires a Ã¢ÂÂcontributionÃ¢ÂÂ that in itself may possibly be regarded as a tax, has a much broader object than the mere raising of revenue. It sets up a scheme for ameliorating the hardships of unemployment, and undertakes, in conjunction with the United States Government, to pay unemployment benefits to those who, without fault of their own, are out of work, to impose the financial burden of doing this upon both employers and employees, and to measure both burden and benefits by the amount of compensation paid to employees when they are working. It is important to the attainment of the last mentioned purpose that the real compensation be not minimized or concealed by embodying it in other forms than money payments. Hence the insertion, in the statutory definitions of Ã¢ÂÂwagesÃ¢ÂÂ above quoted, of words obviously intended to include therein every benefit or advantage which an employee receives from his employer by reason of the service he renders. In view of the purpose of these provisions they should not be whittled down by narrow construction, nor should exceptions not clearly justified by their language be engrafted upon them by judicial interpretation.
More nearly analogous than the income tax laws to the statute now under consideration are the workmenÃ¢ÂÂs compensation laws. A similar question has arisen in determining what are wages under the laws last mentioned, and the decisions upon it have, in the main, taken a more liberal view than *Supp. 873those upon income tax laws. In Bernstein v. Beth Israel Hospital (1923), 236 N. Y. 268 [140 N. E. 694, 30 A. L. R. 598], the court had under consideration the New York WorkmenÃ¢ÂÂs Compensation Law, which contained a definition of wages substantially the same (except that it did not include the words 11 commissions and bonusesÃ¢ÂÂ) as the definition contained in our statute now under consideration when it was first adopted in 1935. Applying this law to an intern in a hospital, who received no pay other than board, lodging and hospital uniforms, and who was under duty to spend his days and nights at the hospital and to render any service exacted by the hospital, within the range prescribed by propriety and custom, the court, speaking through Cardozo, J., held that such intern was an employee and that his right to an award was not defeated by the fact that he received no money for his services, but only lodging, board and uniforms. Since an award under the statute could be made only for a percentage of the compensation (wages, as defined in the statute) received by an employee (a fact not mentioned in the opinion, but appearing on inspection of the statute), this decision necessarily held that the board and lodging there involved were wages, although undoubtedly as clear a case of convenience of the employer from their furnishing appeared as in any decision where the Ã¢ÂÂconvenience ruleÃ¢ÂÂ has been applied.
In 0Ã¢ÂÂCallahan v. Dermedy (1923), 197 Iowa 632 [196 N. W. 10, 197 N. W. 456], where workmenÃ¢ÂÂs compensation was to be computed on the basis of the employeeÃ¢ÂÂs Ã¢ÂÂsalary, wages or earnings in the employmentÃ¢ÂÂ, the court held this provision Ã¢ÂÂis sufficiently broad and comprehensive to include board and lodging that are furnished to the employÃÂ© under the contract of hiring as a part of the compensationÃ¢ÂÂ, and therefore the cash value of board and lodging furnished to a hotel clerk should be taken into account in making an award to him.
In American Surety Co. v. Underwood, (1934; Tex. Civ. App.) 74 S. W. (2d) 551, the workmenÃ¢ÂÂs compensation law defined wages as including the market value of board and lodging which the employee receives as part of his remuneration, and it was held that this included amounts paid to a traveling salesman to reimburse him for his expenditures for board and lodging while traveling, although he maintained a home at which he resided when not traveling.
*Supp. 874In Maryland Casualty Co. v. Geary (1932), 123 Neb. 851 [244 N. W. 797], it appeared that a traveling truck driver received $10 a week plus the cost of his meals and lodging, and the court held that such cost of meals and lodging should be included in his wages in making an award to him under the workmenÃ¢ÂÂs compensation law, in the face of a provision in that law that board and lodging should not be included unless the money value thereof was fixed at the time of hiring. The court said: ""Were it not for the statutory limitation above quoted, there would be no doubt that the meals and lodging furnished by the employer would constitute a part of the employeeÃ¢ÂÂs weekly wageÃ¢ÂÂ, and further held that, on a liberal construction of the law, the same result could be reached notwithstanding the provision referred to.
Other decisions applying the same rule to workmenÃ¢ÂÂs compensation cases are reviewed in a note at 84 A. L. R 188; see, also, Copeland v. Martin Metal Mfg. Co. (1935), 141 Kan. 725 [42 Pac. (2d) 982, 985], to same effect.
Social security laws are so recent that apparently there are no judicial decisions construing them on the point here involved ; at least none are cited to us and we have found none. Two administrative rulings which appear to result from the same view of the matter held by us have been called to our attention. Internal Revenue Cumulative Bulletin 1937-1, at page 380, sets forth an opinion that under the Federal Social Security Act the value of board and lodging, uniforms and laundry furnished to student nurses in a hospital, who receive no salary, is to be regarded as wages.
Another such opinion, published in Internal Revenue Cumulative Bulletin 1938-2, page 323, dealt with board and lodging furnished to employees of a sanitorium located in an isolated mountainous region, who were hired with the understanding that they were to remain available for duty on call and were to ""acceptÃ¢ÂÂ the board and lodging provided. The definition of wages in the federal statute was substantially the same (except that it omitted ""commissions and bonusesÃ¢ÂÂ) as that contained in the 1937 version of our statute, above quoted. This opinion held that such board and lodging were wages, for the purposes of the federal statute, although there was a regulation excluding from that category ""facilities or privileges . . . furnished by the employer merely as a convenience to the employerÃ¢ÂÂ, saying, of this regulation, that *Supp. 875Ã¢ÂÂThe provisions do not ordinarily have application to such items as board and lodging. Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ Reference was also made to the fact that many of the employees who did not receive board and lodging received larger cash remuneration than those who did. This, of course, tended to show that the board and lodging were substituted for a part of the money otherwise payable to the employee and were therefore regarded by the parties as compensation.
This suggests, and we think it is true, that the real question arising under the so-called Ã¢ÂÂconvenience ruleÃ¢ÂÂ is whether the board, lodging or other facility furnished to the employee is in fact a part of his compensation for services rendered. If it is, it must be included as a part of his wages, at least under the law now in question, no matter how greatly the employer may be convenienced by the acceptance of such board, lodging or other facility by the employee. Defendant points to the facts found that the employees here who received board and lodging also received the same cash wages as other employees Ã¢ÂÂfor the same kind and amount of work performedÃ¢ÂÂ, and that the furnishing of board and lodging to the employees who received them Ã¢ÂÂwas not treated as a part of the compensationÃ¢ÂÂ in the contracts of hiring, or held out as such by the defendant. But neither does it appear that there was any agreement that the board and lodging were not compensation, or that they were furnished solely for the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs convenience. Since the employees Ã¢ÂÂwere compelled by the defendant by virtue of their oral contracts of employment to accept said board and lodgingÃ¢ÂÂ, the contracts must have provided for the board and lodging without declaring whether they were to be regarded as compensation or not. This leaves the question open for consideration by the court, even if we concede that an express contract on the matter would be conclusive. Since the cash pay of those who received board and lodging was for the same kind and amount of services as were performed by the other employees who did not receive board and lodging and those other employees were not on duty or on call for purposes of discipline during meal and lodging times, it is obvious that the employees who did receive board and lodging rendered services not paid for by the cash wages, and that they received no pay at all therefor unless the board and lodging be so regarded. Under such circumstances, the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs conclusion that the board and lodging were wages is a reasonable one and must be affirmed.
*Supp. 876Appellant points to a rule made by the predecessor of plaintiff in 1936 (rescinded in 1937), directing that the value of living quarters and meals furnished for the convenience of the employer be not considered a part of wages, and to a more recent Ã¢ÂÂInterpretive OpinionÃ¢ÂÂ of the present commission which, it is claimed, has the same effect, and argues that the plaintiff is in some way barred from abandoning the position thus taken and from now claiming that the board and lodging here in question were wages. We do not find the positions inconsistent, for the finding of the trial court here is, in effect, that the board and lodging were not furnished solely for the convenience of the employer; and they would therefore not be excluded from consideration by either the rule or the Ã¢ÂÂInterpretive OpinionÃ¢ÂÂ. But even were the plaintiff guilty of occupying inconsistent positions, we know of no rule of statute or Constitution which prevents such an administrative board from doing so. Of course if in either position it undertakes to make rules which conflict with the clear meaning of the statute Ã¢ÂÂthey are simply voidÃ¢ÂÂ. [Hodge v. McCall (1921), 185 Cal. 330, 334 [197 Pac. 86].)  If an estoppel can arise in such matters the ingredients of it are lacking here, for neither knowledge of nor reliance on the previous declarations of the commission by defendant, nor resulting action taken by it, appears in the record.
The judgment is affirmed, respondent to recover its costs of appeal.

BISHOP, J.
A pedestrian who finds himself on his way across a street when the traffic signal changes from Ã¢ÂÂGoÃ¢ÂÂ to Ã¢ÂÂStopÃ¢ÂÂ may be impelled by his common sense to retrace his steps to the safety of the nearest curb, but he is not compelled by the law to do so; by continuing on his journey to the opposite curb he may be guilty of negligence, but not of a crime.
The charge upon which the defendant was convicted was that he Ã¢ÂÂbeing a pedestrian crossing the roadway of Hill Street... at an intersection where traffic was then and there controlled by a traffic control signal device and by police officers, did wilfully and unlawfully cross said roadway against a red and stop signal.Ã¢ÂÂ This charge was based upon the provisions of law which first appeared (in 1931) as a part of section 131% of the California Vehicle Code, and which now appear, an immaterial alteration having been effected in 1935, as paragraph (a) of section 563, Vehicle Code, reading: Ã¢ÂÂAt intersections where traffic is controlled by a traffic control signal device or by police officers, pedestrians shall not cross the roadway against a red or stop signal. Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ At the intersection involved in this case the roadways were those parts of the streets between curbs, for by section 83 of the Vehicle Act Ã¢ÂÂroadwayÃ¢ÂÂ is defined as being: Ã¢ÂÂ. . . that portion of a highway improved, designed or ordinarily used for vehicular travel.Ã¢ÂÂ
The evidence discloses that at the time the defendant was arrested traffic was being controlled at the intersection of Sixth and Hill Streets by traffic control signal devices. It further appears, without conflict, that the defendant did not cross Hill Street, as charged, but crossed Sixth Street. Without pausing to consider whether or not this variance between *Supp. 781charge and proof amounts to a failure of proof, we note that it also appears, without dispute, that the defendant began his journey across the roadway while the traffic was advised by the signal devices in operation that it could Ã¢ÂÂGoÃ¢ÂÂ and that he was already several steps into the roadway when the signal changed. Two or more persons who had progressed as far as had the defendant before the signal changed to Ã¢ÂÂStop,Ã¢ÂÂ ventured no further in the direction they had been going, but turned about and returned to the sidewalk they had lately quitted; the defendant walked on to the opposite sidewalk.
In order to avoid being classed as a criminal, what is a person caught in progress across a roadway, when the traffic signal changes from Ã¢ÂÂGoÃ¢ÂÂ to Ã¢ÂÂStop,Ã¢ÂÂ to do? Is he to stop in his tracks (and possibly in those of the street car company also) and await the release of a Ã¢ÂÂGoÃ¢ÂÂ signal? Such a construction of the code provisions would result in so much danger to the trapped pedestrian and in such a snarl of traffic that it is to be avoided if another solution of the question is reasonably possible. (Department of Motor Vehicles v. Industrial Acc. Com., [1939] 14 Cal. (2d) 189, 195 [93 P. (2d) 131].) Equally absurd would be the requirement that he turn at right angles to the course he had been following, so as to proceed with the new flow of traffic and in the path of the vehicular traffic. Only two alternatives are left him; either to retrace his steps or to go on. But if either of these choices violates the injunction that Ã¢ÂÂpedestrians shall not cross the roadway against a red or stop signal,Ã¢ÂÂ both do, for movement in either direction would be against the signal.
There is a construction of the code provision which avoids the absurdities noted, and does so without placing any strain upon the words the legislature selected. Of the many meanings in which the word Ã¢ÂÂcrossÃ¢ÂÂ may be employed, there is one in common use that aptly fits the word as it appears in the section we are considering. It is the first definition of Ã¢ÂÂcrossÃ¢ÂÂ as a verb given in 25 C. J. S. 10: Ã¢ÂÂTo pass from side to side.Ã¢ÂÂ It is among the definitions given in WebsterÃ¢ÂÂs New International Dictionary (2nd ed.): Ã¢ÂÂTo pass or extend from one side to the other of; ... as, to cross a stream ...Ã¢ÂÂ Within this definition, a person born in the Middle West does not cross the continent if he journeys either to the Pacific Coast or to the Atlantic Seaboard. Nor does one cross the continent by plane between sunrise and sunset, if the first hundred miles of the trip is made before sunrise, or the last hundred miles is *Supp. 782made after sunset. So also, one who has advanced into the roadway, even though but a few steps, before the appearance of the Ã¢ÂÂStopÃ¢ÂÂ signal, cannot be said to cross the roadway against that signal, whether he returns to the curb he has just left or continues on to the opposite curb.
Support of some strength is found for our conclusion in cases holding that it is not a violation of an ordinance prohibiting the crossing of roadways except in crosswalks for one alighting from a street car in a safety zone to cross from the zone to the curb outside a crosswalk. In Croxall v. Broadway Department Store, (1932) 127 Cal. App. 153, 156 [15 P. (2d) 546], the court stated: Ã¢ÂÂ. . . the pedestrian crossing from the safety zone to the curb does not come within the strict letter of the ordinance relating to those who are crossing the roadway from curb to curb. (The ordinance, whose pertinent provisions are quoted, uses no such term as Ã¢ÂÂcurb to curbÃ¢ÂÂ; that appears to-be the courtÃ¢ÂÂs interpretation of what it means to cross a roadway.) See also Brockway v. Western Union Tel. Co., (1938) 29 Cal. App. (2d) 244, 247 [84 P. (2d) 524], and Western Union Tel. Co. v. Hudson, (1936) 82 F. (2d) 992, 995.
Further support for our conclusion is found in the provisions of section 476, added to the Vehicle Code in 1939. This section deals with the respective conducts of vehicular traffic and of pedestrians as affected by green or Ã¢ÂÂGo,Ã¢ÂÂ yellow or Ã¢ÂÂCautionÃ¢ÂÂ and red or Ã¢ÂÂStopÃ¢ÂÂ signals. So far as pertinent to our problem it is provided that when the green or Ã¢ÂÂGoÃ¢ÂÂ signal appears, Ã¢ÂÂPedestrians facing the signal may proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked crosswalk,Ã¢ÂÂ but that when the red or Ã¢ÂÂStopÃ¢ÂÂ signal is shown, Ã¢ÂÂNo pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the roadway until green or Ã¢ÂÂGoÃ¢ÂÂ is shown alone.Ã¢ÂÂ Reading sections 563 and 476 together, they appearing as parts of the same code, we conclude that a pedestrian may not, where traffic control signals are in operation, enter upon the roadway until the green or Ã¢ÂÂGoÃ¢ÂÂ signal is shown, but that when it is shown, he may not only enter upon but proceed across to the opposite side of the roadway, even though the signal changes to red or Ã¢ÂÂStopÃ¢ÂÂ before he completes his passage.
The judgment of conviction is reversed and the cause is remanded to the municipal court for a new trial.

PlaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs assignor, Landfield, was a real estate salesman, licensed to act as such under the defendant, Clevelin Realty Corporation, which was a licensed real estate broker, and this action is brought to recover compensation claimed to have been earned by Landfield while acting as such salesman. The defendant filed a cross-complaint against Land-field, alleging that he had been guilty of fraud in making some of the sales for which plaintiff claims compensation, and that defendant had been compelled by reason of such fraud to make settlements and adjustments with the purchasers, and had been damaged thereby. The same matter was pleaded in the answer as an offset to plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs claim. The defendant appeals from a judgment against it on both complaint and cross-complaint.
The testimony given by defendantÃ¢ÂÂs treasurer, Schultz, is sufficient to support the .implied finding that the sum of $561.17, awarded plaintiff by the judgment, was due to Land-field from defendant for commissions. But the evidence also shows without dispute that defendant is entitled to have $300 deducted from that amount for the price of land conveyed to Landfield by defendant. The agreement for the purchase of this land by Landfield from defendant is admitted by plaintiff, as is the receipt of the deed. The agreement provides that the price, $300, is to be a charge against Land-fieldÃ¢ÂÂs contingent commission account and to be retained by defendant from moneys received by it against that account.
Plaintiff now objects to that deed on the ground that the authority of those who executed it for defendant is not shown. Schultz testified that a resolution conferring such authority had been passed by the board of directors. It is true the minute book and the original resolution were not produced, but a corporation minute book is not the only competent evidence to prove the passage of resolutions by its board of directors. Oral evidence is permissible for that purpose. (Boggs v. Lakeport etc. Assn., (1896) 111 Cal. 354, 357 [43 P. 1106] ; Michaels v. Pacific S. W. Laundry, (1930) 104 Cal.App. 349, 362 [286 P. 165, 1071].) Oral proof of the contents of the resolution might have been subject to the best evidence rule, but no objection to the evidence on that *908ground appears. No evidence in disproof of the authority to execute the deed was given. Nothing appeared, therefore, to authorize the belated attempt to rescind this transaction because of non-performance by defendant, made by plaintiff rather than LandÃÂ±eld, at the hearing of the motion for a new trial, even if rescission could properly be had at that stage of the proceedings.
It appears without dispute that the land which plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs assignor, Landfield, sold for defendant and for sale of which compensation is claimed, was owned by. defendant. On this fact a doubt arose whether plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs claim was not barred by the provisions of the California Real Estate Act (DeeringÃ¢ÂÂs General Laws 1937, Act 112, Stats. 1919, p. 1252 as amended), and re-argument was allowed on this question. We have concluded that the action is not so barred. The statute above mentioned provides for licensing real estate brokers and real estate salesmen, a salesmanÃ¢ÂÂs license authorizing him to act only under the particular broker by whom he is employed when it is issued. Section 2 defines the term Ã¢ÂÂreal estate brokerÃ¢ÂÂ so as to include Ã¢ÂÂa person, copartnership or corporation who, for a compensationÃ¢ÂÂ does any of a series of acts which may be characterized generally as negotiating real estate transactions, Ã¢ÂÂfor another or others.Ã¢ÂÂ It defines Ã¢ÂÂreal estate salesmanÃ¢ÂÂ so as to include Ã¢ÂÂone who for a compensation is employed by a licensed brokerÃ¢ÂÂ to do any of the acts which are included in the definition of a broker. The definition of a salesman does not include the words Ã¢ÂÂfor another or others,Ã¢ÂÂ appearing in the definition of a broker, or any other words which expressly limit the acts of a salesman to those done for principals other than the broker by whom he is employed. We see no reason to read such limitation into the definition of a salesman, by implication.
Section 2 does, it is true, further provide that the statute,Ã¢ÂÂexcept sections 19a and 20a to 20 1, which relate to approval of subdivisions of land by the Real Estate Commissioner and are of no consequence hereÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂshall not apply to anyone who shall directly perform any of the acts aforesaid with reference to his own property, Ã¢ÂÂ or in case of corporate owners to their regular officers performing such acts without special compensation. Defendant being a corporation, its regular officers could act under this provision without licenses, but the provision does not purport to provide what sort of license its other employees must hold in order to act for it.  Section 2 further provides that Ã¢ÂÂone act, for a com*909pensation of buying or selling real estate for anotherÃ¢ÂÂ etc. shall constitute the person doing so Ã¢ÂÂa real estate broker or salesman under this act.Ã¢ÂÂ The salesman selling his employerÃ¢ÂÂs land acts Ã¢ÂÂfor another,Ã¢ÂÂ but it is consistent with the provision last quoted that he remain merely a salesman when doing so.
Section 18 makes it unlawful for a licensed broker to pay Ã¢ÂÂcompensation for performing any of the acts herein specifiedÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂthe reference by Ã¢ÂÂhereinÃ¢ÂÂ apparently being to the act as a wholeÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂto any person who is not a licensed broker, or a salesman licensed under the broker paying the compensation,Ã¢ÂÂ and forbids a real estate salesman to Ã¢ÂÂaccept compensation from any person other than the broker under whom he is at the time licensed.Ã¢ÂÂ These provisions are also consistent with plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs right to recover for the acts done by Landfield here. The first of them is broad enough to include acts which would, except for plaintiffÃ¢ÂÂs position as salesman, be those of a broker; and neither contains any words which limit the compensation which may be paid by a broker to his salesman to transactions in which the broker is acting as such. Section 18 further provides that it is a misdemeanor Ã¢ÂÂfor any person, firm or corporation, whether obligor, escrow holder or otherwise, to pay or deliver to anyone a compensation for performing any of the acts specified in section 2 hereof, who shall not be known to be, or present evidence to such payor that he is a regularly licensed real estate broker at the time such compensation is earned.Ã¢ÂÂ This reference to section 2 is broad enough, if it stood alone, to include acts as a salesman, but its context, both in this sentence and in the provisions of section 18 previously referred to, show that it does not intend to deal with payments made by a licensed broker to a salesman licensed under him.
A possible objection to the conclusion wÃÂ© have stated is that it renders the words Ã¢ÂÂlicensed broker,Ã¢ÂÂ in the definition of a salesman, to a considerable extent a mere description of the person who employs the salesman, rather than a designation of the field in which the salesman acts for him. However, this is a reasonably possible interpretation of the words used, which are ambiguous in this respect, and it is to be preferred because of the very inconvenient results of a contrary interpretation. [6] Ã¢ÂÂ In construing a doubtful statute, no doubt the court may take into consideration any great inconvenience which may result from a given construction.Ã¢ÂÂ *910(23 Cal.Jur. 768; Reithardt v. Board of Education, (1941) 43 Cal.App.2d 629, 633 [111 P.2d 440].) Where a statute is ambiguous, the court Ã¢ÂÂmay look beyond the law itself and take into consideration the consequences of a particular construction or interpretation, and if the language used permits, give to the statute a construction which is in harmony with sound sense and wise policy-Ã¢ÂÂone which will make the statute practically operative with the least injury to those upon whom it spends its force so that a statute designed to regulate will not be so construed as to destroy.Ã¢ÂÂ {In re La Belle (1940) 37 Cal.App.2d 32, 38-9 [98 P.2d 778].)
It is a matter of common knowledge, and no doubt the Legislature when it enacted this statute was aware, that subdivisions of land for the purpose of sale are often promoted and placed on the market, at least in part, by real estate brokers who own them or have some interest in them beyond the mere expectation of earning brokerÃ¢ÂÂs commissions by their sale, and that in many other eases brokers own or have such an interest in the land which they sell. It would be a matter of great inconvenience if in such cases the brokers could not set the salesman employed by them at the work of selling such land, but must employ other brokers for that purpose. Upon the salesman would be placed the burden of ascertaining before entering into a transaction whether his employer had any interest in the land involved, or taking the chance of working for nothing if such interest existed. These results would necessarily follow from the provisions of section 18, unless a salesman may be regarded as acting in that capacity when he sells his employing brokerÃ¢ÂÂs own land. Construing the statute according to the rule of convenience above stated, we think he may be so regarded. The act itself suggests no reason for not so construing it. Its purpose is to require honesty and fair dealing on the part of those engaged in- the real estate business, and this purpose is to be carried out by requiring proof of honesty and good reputation before a license to engage in that business, either as broker or salesman, can be issued (secs. 9a, 9b), and providing for revocation of a license to act in either capacity for dishonesty or fraud (sec. 12). A salesman selling his employerÃ¢ÂÂs own property stands in no relation to the public with whom he deals substantially different from that of a salesman selling, in behalf of his employer, the property of others. Under our construction of the statute the sanctions of the statute, in*911tended to ensure Ms honesty, will apply to a salesman equally in either case, and thus its purpose will be as fully carried out as if the owning and selling broker were to employ another broker, instead of his own salesman, to sell for him.
We do not find it proper to modify the judgment by deducting from it the sum of $300 herein discussed, and thereupon to affirm it, because of defendantÃ¢ÂÂs cross-complaint and the offset pleaded in the answer. Defendant offered substantial evidence in support of its allegations, and we would not be warranted in passing upon the weight of this evidence, as we must do in order to make a finding here on the amount, if any, to be awarded plaintiff. The questions arising on this cross-complaint and offset have not been discussed, so we express no opinion upon them, but suggest that if this matter is urged on a new trial more attention be given to the question of measure of damages than it appears to have received heretofore.
The judgment is reversed, and the cause is remanded to the municipal court for a new trial, appellant to recover its costs of appeal.

SHAW, P. J.
Plaintiff sues for rent due on a written lease, made long before the United States entered into the present war. The only defense to which evidence was addressed at the trial is that defendantÃ¢ÂÂs use of the premises for the purposes for which the lease was made became unlawful or at least unprofitable by reason of certain regulations made by the Federal Government, under its war powers, regarding the sale of tires and tubes. In support of the judgment for defendant he invokes the doctrine of Ã¢ÂÂcommercial frustration,Ã¢ÂÂ as it is sometimes called, claiming that he can no longer carry on with profit the business for which he leased the property and that he is for that reason freed from his obligations under the lease.
The lease contains no limitation of the uses to which the lessee may put the leased property. In the absence of such limitation, the tenant may use the property for any lawful purpose not materially different from that in which they are usually employed, to which they are adapted or for which they were constructed. (36 C.J. 84, 87; Keating v. Preston (1940) 42 Cal.App.2d 110, 115 [108 P.2d 479].) The fact that before the written lease was entered into the parties discussed defendantÃ¢ÂÂs use of the building, and defendant said he wanted to lease it to engage in the tire business and would engage in that and the battery business does not limit his use to those purposes. The conversation does not purport to have that effect, and even if it did, it could not be given such *913effect against the written lease containing no such limitation. (Sec. 1625, Civ. Code; sec. 1856, Code Civ. Proc; Gibbs v. Seeger (1933) 130 Cal.App. 123, 128 [19 P.2d 514].)
It appears that after defendant took possession of the leased property he conducted therein the business of selling new and used tires, chiefly the latter, and did some business Ã¢ÂÂ¢ in taking in tires for retreading and vulcanizing, in fixing flat tires and in recharging and renting batteries. The property, as described in the record, was adapted and suitable for all these purposes, as well as others, and undoubtedly defendant had the right, under his lease, to engage in these and other lines of business for which such a structure could readily be used. The government regulations to which defendant refers did not affect at all the battery business or the fixing of flat tires, nor did they prohibit the selling of new or used tires or the retreading of tires altogether. They prohibited such sales and retreading except to persons who had certificates therefor from their ration boards and greatly limited the classes of persons who could obtain such certificates. Thus the defendant could carry on parts of his business as before, and was not altogether stopped in any of it, although the number of possible customers for the major part of the business as he conducted it was cut down and it was probably thereby made unprofitable for him to continue in business.
The law applicable to such a situation was declared in Grace v. Croninger (1936) 12 Cal.App.2d 603, 607 [55 P.2d 940], where property had been leased under a lease which limited the lessee to carrying on therein the business of a saloon and cigar store and a bootblack stand, and thereafter the saloon business was made unlawful by the War-Time Prohibition Act, and the court held that this act did not invalidate the lease, and rent accruing after it took effect could be collected from a guarantor, saying: Ã¢ÂÂ . . . where the contract does not restrict the use of the leased premises to a single purpose, it is not invalidated by a subsequent enactment prohibiting the use for less than all of the several purposes specified.Ã¢ÂÂ The same rule was followed in Burke v. San Francisco Breweries, Ltd. (1913) 21 Cal.App. 198, 203 [131 P. 83].
The same question arose under the present wartime regulation stopping the sale of new automobiles except to those *914who can obtain ration board certificates authorizing them to buy, in Byrne v. Balcom (N.Y.App. Div. 1942) 38 N.Y.S. 2d 801, 803. That was an action by a landlord to recover rent due on a lease, and the defendant, who was an automobile dealer, set up the regulation just mentioned as a defense. On this point, the court said: Ã¢ÂÂUndoubtedly the lease contemplated the sale of new cars on the premises but the lessee is not restricted to the exclusive sale of such ears but may devote the property to other legal uses specified in the lease. This is not a case where the parties entered into a lease exclusively for a use which was not illegal when the contract was made but which was subsequently made illegal by operation of law. . . . Respondent is not entirely prohibited by government decree from selling new cars. His right to do so is restricted.
Ã¢ÂÂThere can be no doubt about the proposition that where a lease restricts and limits the use of the premises let to a particular specified purpose and thereafter, because of the enactment of valid governmental statutes, decrees or regulations such use becomes unlawful, the subject matter of the contract is destroyed and the covenants of such lease will not be enforced against either party thereto. The rule is that where the lease is exclusive the subsquent passage of prohibitory laws terminates it. A change in the law during the term of the lease, however, which merely restricts but does not wholly prohibit the conduct of the business carried on, does not release the tenant from his obligation to pay rent.Ã¢ÂÂ
Other recent New York cases are cited by the parties, but as they are decisions by trial courts or other tribunals inferior to the Appellate Division, we do not review them. None of them appears to be based on a view of the law inconsistent with that appearing in Byrne v. Balcom.
The judgment is reversed, and the cause is remanded to the municipal court for a new trial, appellant to recover her costs on appeal.

McWILLIAMS, J.
Plaintiffs sued the defendants for damages alleged to have been sustained by them as a result of the purchase of certain San Francisco residence property. The purchase price of the property was $8,400. At the time that plaintiffs bought the property the living room contained a fireplace which obviously had been used. However, the fireplace contained no chimney or flue which, it developed during the trial, had been sealed up by the defendants many years before. Although the plaintiffs had made a number of inspections of the property before they purchased it they had failed to discover the defect in the fireplace. This conduct of the defendants in failing to notify plaintiffs of the condition of the fireplace was found in the lower court to constitute fraud on their part. That court also found that it would cost $470 to put the fireplace into a working condition. But the lower court also found that at the time the plaintiffs bought the property it had a fair market value of $8,950, being $550 more than the plaintiffs had paid for the property. That court also found that the valuation of $8,950 was not less than or in any wise affected by the fact that the fireplace was not in a condition to be used. Hence, the court concluded, plaintiffs were not damaged and rendered judgment in favor of the defendants. From that judgment plaintiffs have taken this appeal. They contend that the finding as to the value of the property at the time of the sale is not supported by the evidence and also that even if true it is immaterial. A review of the evidence convinces us that the finding is supported by the evidence, particularly in view of the fact that the testimony offered on behalf of the defendants as to the value of the property was not contradicted by the plaintiffs.
Whether or not the finding referred to is immaterial as contended presents a more serious question. Defendants concede for the purpose of the appeal that the finding of the lower court with reference to the fraud alleged to have been *917perpetrated by them is supported by the evidence. They contend that since plaintiffs did not show that they were damaged the judgment rendered by the lower court was a proper one. Their position is that since it is apparent under the finding made by the lower court with reference to the value of the property purchased that the plaintiffs received more than their moneyÃ¢ÂÂs worth it must follow that they suffered no damage by reason of the fact that the fireplace was not in a condition to be used.
The plaintiffs, on the other hand, argue that in an action for deceit in the sale or exchange of property, the party defrauded is entitled to recover the difference between the actual value of what he received and the value which it would have had if the representations had been true, citing the case of George Cople v. Hinde, 34 Cal.App. 576 [170 P. 155], in support of this contention. Hence, say plaintiffs, if they have shown that the property would have been worth more had there been a usable fireplace in it, as the lower court found was impliedly represented to them by defendants, they are entitled to judgment.
PlaintiffsÃ¢ÂÂ conclusion is sound if the law of this state is as they claim. Whether it is sound or not requires a review of the authorities in this state.
Up to 1935 the courts of this state applied what has been termed (McCormick on Damages, p. 448; 24 Am. Jur. p. 52) the Ã¢ÂÂloss of the bargainÃ¢ÂÂ rule for measuring, damages in cases of the kind here presented. Under this rule which prevails in most states a plaintiff who is defrauded in the purchase of property is allowed to recover the difference between the actual value of the property received and the value that it would have had had it been as represented. (Porter v. Hilton, 214 Cal. 705, 708 [298 P. 501, 7 P.2d 301].) Our Supreme Court in one case apparently realized that the application of this doctrine, which it termed Ã¢ÂÂthe extreme rule,Ã¢ÂÂ might at times result in hardship and therefore held that it was only to be applied in clear cases and on just terms. {Hines v. Brode, 168 Cal. 507, 511 [143 P. 729].)
The opposing rule which is followed in a few states and also in the federal courts and in England (McCormick on Damages, p. 448; also see Sigafus v. Porter, 179 U.S. 116 [21 S.Ct. 34, 45 L.Ed. 113] and cases there cited) has been termed the Ã¢ÂÂout-of-pocket lossÃ¢ÂÂ rule. Under that rule the defrauded plaintiff is allowed to recover the difference be*918tween the value of what he parted with and the value of the property that he received. He is also allowed to recover under this rule as well as under the Ã¢ÂÂloss of the bargainÃ¢ÂÂ rule all expenditures actually made by him as a result of the fraudulent conduct of the seller. (McCormick on Damages, p. 458; Edward Barron Estate Co. v. Woodruff Co., 163 Cal. 561, 578 [126 P. 351, 42 L.R.A. N.S. 125].) The reason for this rule is, as stated by one federal court that:
Ã¢ÂÂA person is not cheated when that which he gets is worth all that he pays for it, which is also common sense. He may anticipate more, and be falsely led to expect it, on the strength of which he may be entitled to be relieved from- the bargain. But if he holds onto it, he cannot claim damages for the deceit, if he has suffered no loss which is the case, where, although not getting all that he had the right to expect, he gets after all the worth of his money.Ã¢ÂÂ (Pittsburgh L. & T. Co. v. Northern Cent. Life Ins. Co., 140 F. 888, 898.)
However, in view of the fact that since the federal courts are required since the overruling of Swift v. Tyson, 16 Pet. (U.S.) 1 [10 L.Ed. 865] by Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64 [58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188, 114 A.L.R. 1487] to follow state decisions on matters of general law the main support for the minority rule would appear to have collapsed.
In opposition to the Ã¢ÂÂout-of-pocket lossÃ¢ÂÂ rule it is urged that, as stated by Professor Williston: Ã¢ÂÂA practical reason for the enforcement of the broader rule may be found in the fact that under the other rule a fraudulent person can in no event lose anything by his fraud. He runs the chance of making a profit if he successfully carries out his plan and is not afterwards brought to account for it; and if he is brought to account he at least will lose nothing by his misconduct.Ã¢ÂÂ 5 Williston on Contracts, revised edition, section 1392.
Neither rule has proved altogether satisfactory and as a result the law has fluctuated from time to time in some of the states (24 Am.Jur. p. 60).
After considering the merits of the two rules the American Law Institute in its Restatement of the Law of Torts adopted the federal or Ã¢ÂÂout-of-pocketÃ¢ÂÂ loss rule. (Rest., ÃÂ§ 549.)
In 1935 the Legislature of this state added section 3343 to the Civil Code. It reads as follows:
Ã¢ÂÂDamages for fraud in the purchase, sale or exchange of property. One defrauded in the purchase, sale or exchange of property is entitled to recover the difference between the *919actual value of that with which the defrauded person parted and the actual value of that which he received, together with any additional damage arising from the particular transaction.
Ã¢ÂÂNothing herein contained shall be deemed to deny to any person having a cause of action for fraud or deceit any legal or equitable remedies to which such person may be entitled.Ã¢ÂÂ
By that amendment the Ã¢ÂÂout-of-pocket lossÃ¢ÂÂ rule was substituted for the Ã¢ÂÂloss of the bargainÃ¢ÂÂ rule. (See Rothstein v. Janss Inv. Corp., 45 Cal.App.2d 64, 73 [113 P.2d 465]; 13 So.Cal.L.Rev. 168.)
It is true that the first sentence of the section authorizes a purchaser not only to recover damages under the Ã¢ÂÂout-of-pocket lossÃ¢ÂÂ rule, but also to recover any additional damage arising from the particular transaction. That latter provision was evidently intended to cover a situation where for example a buyer was obliged to move from the property that he had been fraudulently induced to purchase on account of the dangerous character of the premises. In such a case he could not only recover the difference between the amount that he had paid for the property and its actual value but also recover the expense of moving. (Barr v. Kimball, 43 Neb. 766 [62 N.W. 196]. Also see McRae v. Lonsby, 130 F. 17 [64 C.C.A. 385]; Womack v. Hastings, (Tex.Civ.App.) 200 S.W. 878.)
If the instrument of conveyance taken by plaintiffs had contained a warranty or covenant of the existence of a usable fireplace they could have sued on such warranty or covenant even though the sellers had known that there was no fireplace in the building when they executed the deed and intended to deceive the plaintiffs. In such an action the plaintiffs could have recovered the difference between the value of the land as they received it and its value with the fireplace. In other words the Ã¢ÂÂloss of the bargain ruleÃ¢ÂÂ of damages would have been applicable. This is well settled in the law of sales of personal property and we see no reason why the same doctrine should not be applied by analogy in the case of the sale of real property. The reason for the rule in the law of sales is that ordinarily the buyer in ease of a breach of warranty is entitled to recover the difference between the value of the goods at the time of their delivery to the buyer and the value the goods would have had if they had answered the *920warranty. (Civ. Code, sec. 1789 (7)). The addition of the element of fraud will not deprive the buyer of rights that he would have had if the element of fraud were lacking. (5 Williston on Contracts, rev. ed., sec. 1392, p. 3886.)
This doctrine to which we have just adverted suggests an explanation of the proviso in section 3343 to the effect that nothing in the section shall be deemed to deny to any person having a cause of action for fraud any legal or equitable remedies to which such person may be entitled. But it cannot avail plaintiffs because it does not appear that there was any covenant of the existence of a fireplace in the deed taken by plaintiffs. The proviso would also have authorized plaintiffs to rescind the purchase had they seen fit to take such action. But in view of the failure of the plaintiffs to rescind the purchase it is evident that the judgment of the trial court was correct. It is therefore affirmed.

JOHNSON, P. J.
Plaintiff, the People (hereinafter, appellant) appeal from an order dismissing a misdemeanor complaint charging defendant Joel Alvarado (hereinafter, respondent) with driving with a suspended license (Veh. *Supp. 3Code, ÃÂ§ 14601.1, subd. (a)) and willfully failing to obey a lawful order by a peace officer (Veh. Code, ÃÂ§ 2800). Appellant contends the trial court committed reversible error in dismissing the complaint in the absence of a showing that respondent suffered actual prejudice as a result of prearraignment delay. We agree with appellantÃ¢ÂÂs contention. The order of dismissal is reversed.
I.
On April 24, 1995, a complaint was filed charging respondent with driving with a suspended license (Veh. Code, ÃÂ§ 14601.1, subd. (a)) and willfully failing to obey a lawful order by a peace officer (Veh. Code, ÃÂ§ 2800). Respondent failed to appear for arraignment on May 15, 1995, and the trial court issued an arrest warrant. Respondent subsequently appeared on October 25, 1996; the warrant was recalled; and respondent was arraigned.
On November 8, 1996, respondent filed a motion to dismiss, alleging denial of his Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial based on the 18-month delay between the filing of the complaint and his arraignment. At the hearing on the speedy trial motion, appellant produced two letters mailed to respondent informing him of the May 15, 1995, arraignment date. However, the court found appellant had failed to justify the delay because the letters were misaddressed and appellant had made no further attempts to contact respondent.
The trial court found respondent had failed to establish actual prejudice as a result of the prearraignment delay. However, the court concluded such prejudice was presumed in view of appellantÃ¢ÂÂs failure to justify the delay. The court granted respondentÃ¢ÂÂs motion to dismiss the complaint on speedy trial grounds. Appellant filed a timely notice of appeal from the order of dismissal.
II.
The Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial attaches with the filing of the accusatory pleading or the arrest, whichever occurs first. (Serna v. Superior Court (1985) 40 Cal.3d 239, 262 [219 Cal.Rptr. 420, 707 P.2d 793].)  Ã¢ÂÂ[A] delay[] between the filing of a [misdemeanor] complaint and the arrest [and prosecution] of a defendant which exceeds [one year is] unreasonable and thus presumptively prejudicial. . . .Ã¢ÂÂ (Id. at pp. 252-253.)
RespondentÃ¢ÂÂs Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial attached on April 24, 1995, the date the complaint was filed. He was arraigned on October 25, *Supp. 41996. Appellant concedes that the 18-month delay was presumptively prejudicial and concedes the delay was unjustified.
Pursuant to Barker v. Wingo (1972) 407 U.S. 514, 530 [92 S.Ct. 2182, 2192, 33 L.Ed.2d 101], the presumptively prejudicial length of delay operates as a Ã¢ÂÂtriggering mechanismÃ¢ÂÂ which necessitates inquiry into other factors. All of the factors must be balanced in order to determine whether or not there was a violation of respondentÃ¢ÂÂs federal right to a speedy trial. In addition to the length of the delay, the other factors which must be weighed by the trial court are: (1) the reason for the delay; (2) the defendantÃ¢ÂÂs assertion of his right to a speedy trial; and (3) actual prejudice to the defendant. (Ibid.) The foregoing factors are related and must be considered together with such other circumstances as may be relevant. (Id. at p. 533 [92 S.Ct. at p. 2193].)
To prevail on a Sixth Amendment speedy trial claim, a defendant must demonstrate actual prejudice unless Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂthe first three Barker factors weighed heavily against the government. . . .Ã¢ÂÂ [Citations.]Ã¢ÂÂ (Gallenkamp v. Superior Court (1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 1, 18 [270 Cal.Rptr. 346].) Additionally, the United States Supreme Court has established that a trial court must consider how much time had passed beyond the Ã¢ÂÂpresumptive prejudiceÃ¢ÂÂ threshold. The longer the delay in arresting a defendant Ã¢ÂÂstretches beyond the bare minimum needed to trigger judicial examination of the [speedy trial] claim,Ã¢ÂÂ the more weight the trial court should give to those factors favoring an accusedÃ¢ÂÂs motion to dismiss. (Doggett v. United States (1992) 505 U.S. 647, 652 [112 S.Ct. 2686, 2691, 120 L.Ed.2d 520].)
Here, as indicated earlier, there was a prearraignment delay of 18 months. With respect to whether the delay was justified, appellant argued it had exercised reasonable diligence in attempting to locate respondent. Ã¢ÂÂThe finding[] of the court[] below [is] to the contrary, however, and we review [the] trial court determination[] of negligence with considerable deference. [Citations.]Ã¢ÂÂ (Doggett v. United States, supra, 505 U.S. at p. 652 [112 S.Ct. at p. 2691].) Neither party disputes that respondent asserted his right to a speedy trial in a timely manner.
 U.S. v. Beamon (9th Cir. 1993) 992 F.2d 1009,1 is directly on point.  In Beamon, government negligence caused a delay of 17 months in bringing defendant Beamon to trial and a delay of 20 months in bringing defendant McMillin to trial. Both defendants timely asserted their *Supp. 5right to a speedy trial. The trial court found the delays were presumptively prejudicial, since they were Ã¢ÂÂwell over one year.Ã¢ÂÂ (Id. at p. 1013.) However, the court there held that the defendants still had to show actual prejudice to establish they were denied the right to a speedy trial, since Ã¢ÂÂthe delays in this case [were] not Ã¢ÂÂgreat.Ã¢ÂÂ Seventeen and 20 months are only five to eight months longer than the one-year benchmark which triggers the speedy trial inquiry under Barker v. Wingo.Ã¢ÂÂ (Id. at p. 1014.) Ã¢ÂÂ[W]hile the governmentÃ¢ÂÂs negligence caused a delay long enough to trigger a speedy trial inquiry under Barker, the delay of 17 to 20 months is not sufficient to excuse the defendants altogether from any showing of actual prejudice.Ã¢ÂÂ (Id. at p. 1015.)2
U.S. v. Beamon, supra, 992 F.2d 1009, indicates that the 18-month delay in this case was insufficient to excuse respondent from any showing of actual prejudice. While the trial court determined that respondent failed to show actual prejudice, it erroneously concluded such prejudice was presumed in view of appellantÃ¢ÂÂs failure to justify the prearraignment delay. Based on the facts herein, the trial court committed reversible error in dismissing the complaint absent a showing that respondent suffered actual prejudice as a result of the delay.
The order of dismissal is reversed.
Roberson, J., and Todd, J., concurred.

While decisions by lower federal courts on constitutional issues are not necessarily controlling, they are persuasive authority and entitled to great weight. (People v. Bradley (1969) 1 Cal.3d 80, 86 [81 Cal.Rptr. 457, 460 P.2d 129].)


While the defendants in Beamon were charged with felonies, and respondent was charged with misdemeanors, the cases are analogous because the presumptively prejudicial period in both instances is one year. (See Serna v. Superior Court, supra, 40 Cal.3d at p. 254.)

Opinion
OÃ¢ÂÂNEILL, P. J.
We consider the validity of an automobile stop based solely on an officerÃ¢ÂÂs belief that the vehicleÃ¢ÂÂs windows were illegally tinted in violation of Vehicle Code section 26708, subdivision (a).1

The Case.

Appellant stands charged with driving under the influence of alcohol based on an investigation that began with the automobile stop at issue in this *Supp. 8case. After his Penal Code section 1538.5 motion was denied, trial proceedings were stayed and be brought this pretrial appeal pursuant to section 1538.5, subdivision (j).

The Undisputed Facts.

California Highway Patrol Officer Meza, a three-year veteran who had stopped vehicles on suspicion of illegally tinted windows approximately four hundred times, was in his vehicle on duty on an October night. As he prepared to make a right turn at the intersection of Thousand Oaks and Westlake Boulevards, appellant passed through the intersection from the officerÃ¢ÂÂs left to his right, at 10-15 miles per hour. The intersection was lighted and near a shopping center. AppellantÃ¢ÂÂs vehicle was a black Mustang, and the officer noted that the right front window was Ã¢ÂÂso black that it kind of matched the color of the car.Ã¢ÂÂ He also testified that he was unable to see the occupants of the vehicle.
The officer followed the Mustang, pulling it over as it entered the nearby Ventura Freeway. The tinted window was the only basis for the stop, which became a driving under the influence investigation almost immediately when the officer noted an odor of alcohol and appellant admitted drinking. AppellantÃ¢ÂÂs motion to suppress addressed all observations of the officer after the initial stop, as well as the results of a breath test which revealed that appellantÃ¢ÂÂs blood-alcohol level was over twice the legal limit.

Discussion.

Appellant relied on the holding in People v. Butler (1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 602, 607 [248 Cal.Rptr. 887]: Ã¢ÂÂWe disagree with the PeopleÃ¢ÂÂs suggestion that seeing someone lawfully driving with tinted glass raises a reasonable suspicion of illegality such that a reasonable inquiry is justified. Without additional articulable facts suggesting that the tinted glass is illegal, the detention rests upon the type of speculation which may not properly support an investigative stop.Ã¢ÂÂ In Butler, an officer who wished to check out the occupants of a suspicious vehicle near a liquor store at 2 a.m. based his detention on the observation that the side and rear windows of the vehicle were Ã¢ÂÂdarkenedÃ¢ÂÂ to the point of being Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂan obvious vehicle Code violation.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ (202 Cal.App.3d at p. 605.) The Court of Appeal found this record insufficient to support a reasonable suspicion that the tinting was illegal, noting that the officer had observed the vehicle from a distance late at night as he drove by and, again, as it Ã¢ÂÂsped past him.Ã¢ÂÂ (Id. at p. 606.)
The People rely on People v. Niebauer (1989) 214 Cal.App.3d 1278 [263 Cal.Rptr. 287], where the issue was the sufficiency of the evidence to *Supp. 9support a conviction for a violation of Vehicle Code section 26708, subdivision (a). The Court of Appeal held that believable testimony based on an officerÃ¢ÂÂs general training and experience can be sufficient: Ã¢ÂÂIf an officer forms an opinion in a commonsense examination of a vehicle that there is a film placed upon the vehicleÃ¢ÂÂs windows in an unauthorized place or that light is obstructed in the fashion contemplated by the statute, such evidence will be sufficient to support a conviction under section 26708, [subdivision] (a) if the trial court believes the officer; no further evidence or scientific testimony need be presented.Ã¢ÂÂ (214 Cal.App.3d at p. 1292.) The court then upheld NiebauerÃ¢ÂÂs conviction based on an officerÃ¢ÂÂs testimony that aftermarket tinting unlawfully obstructed vision, where that officer had no training or expertise regarding light transmittance, but did have experience with detaining other drivers with the same type of tinting after observing their difficulty seeing through their windows at night. (Id. at pp. 1292-1293.)
The traffic stop in the Niebauer case was apparently based solely on the officerÃ¢ÂÂs observation of the tinted windows and his suspicion that the tinting was unlawful. No Fourth Amendment issue was raised, but the Court of Appeal noted in a footnote that People v. Butler, supra, 202 Cal.App.3d 602, would have been distinguishable because the officer Ã¢ÂÂtestified to additional facts giving him reasonable suspicion Niebauer was driving with illegally tinted windows other than merely the bare statement NiebauerÃ¢ÂÂs truck had tinted windows.Ã¢ÂÂ (People v. Niebauer, supra, 214 Cal.App.3d at p. 1293, fn. 10.)
This Niebauer dictum is consistent with logic and settled Fourth Amendment case law, which gives considerable weight to officer experience and permits detention based on articulable suspicious facts even though not necessarily inconsistent with innocent activity. (See U.S. v. Cortez (1981) 449 U.S. 411, 418 [101 S.Ct. 690, 695, 66 L.Ed.2d 621], In re Tony C. (1978) 21 Cal.3d 888, 893-894 [148 Cal.Rptr. 366, 582 P.2d 957].) Officer experience is of particular significance in the enforcement of areas of the law which are frequently encountered, such as vehicle theft and equipment violations. (See e.g., People v. Jones (1980) 103 Cal.App.3d 885, 888-890 [163 Cal.Rptr. 251] [expertise suggests reasonable possibility car stolen]; People v. May (1977) 76 Cal.App.3d 543, 545-547 [143 Cal.Rptr. 45] [officerÃ¢ÂÂs informal training and past experience checking out some 1,000 custom hydraulic suspension systems justified inspection of interior of trunk].) Indeed the duty and power of peace officers to detain and inspect vehicles for suspected equipment and safety violations have been codified in Vehicle Code sections 2804 and 2806.
The Butler opinion is not inconsistent with the above. In Butler the Court of Appeal held only that a detention for tinted windows is unlawful Ã¢ÂÂ[without additional articulable facts suggesting that the tinted glass is illegal.Ã¢ÂÂ *Supp. 10(People v. Butler, supra, 202 Cal.App.3d at p. 607.) We conclude that where such additional facts are present, a vehicle stop to investigate the legality of tinted windows is lawful.
The facts supporting the detention in the present case are similar to those found sufficient to convict in People v. Niebauer, supra, 214 Cal.App.3d 1278. Ã¢ÂÂIt would be ironical if evidence . . . were admissible on the question of guilt . . . but could not be taken into consideration on the issue of probable cause to detain.Ã¢ÂÂ (People v. Jones, supra, 103 Cal.App.3d at p. 890, fn. 1.) Unlike in People v. Butler, supra, 202 Cal.App.3d 602, there was no evidence that the stop in the present case was a pretext. Officer Meza had substantial experience in enforcing this particular statute. Since it was nighttime, illegal tinting was a greater safety concern. AppellantÃ¢ÂÂs vehicle passed relatively slowly and directly in front of the officer at a lighted intersection. The tinting was so dark as to appear black and prevent the officer from seeing the occupants of the front seats. On this undisputed record, we find the detention reasonable.

Disposition.

We affirm the denial of the motion to suppress and remand for trial or disposition.
Peck, J., and Jones, J., concurred.

Vehicle Code section 26708, subdivision (a) provides, in part, that with certain exceptions: Ã¢ÂÂ(1) No person shall drive any motor vehicle with any object or material placed, displayed, installed, affixed, or applied upon the windshield or side or rear windows. FID (2) No person shall drive any motor vehicle with any object or material placed, displayed, installed, affixed, or applied in or upon the vehicle which obstructs or reduces the driverÃ¢ÂÂs clear view through the windshield or side windows. . . .Ã¢ÂÂ

It is our opinion that respondentÃ¢ÂÂs motion to dismiss this appeal should be denied.
Under the provisions of section 983a, Code of Civil Procedure, a party against whom judgment is rendered is given sixty days within which to take an appeal from such judgment where no notice of entry of judgment has been given by the adverse party. The language of the section is, in part, Ã¢ÂÂbut the time within which such appeal may be taken shall not in any event exceed sixty days after entry of the judgment or order, except that if proceedings on motion for new trial are pending, the time for appeal from the judgment shall not expire until fifteen days after entry of an order determining such motion for a new trial. . . . The time for appeal is also extended in the manner, for the period, and under the circumstances prescribed in section 12a of this code.Ã¢ÂÂ (Emphasis ours.)
In the instant ease a motion for new trial was made and denied by the trial court before the expiration of the sixty-day limitation on appeals from judgments. The order denying such motion was made more than fifteen days prior to the filing of appellantÃ¢ÂÂs notice of appeal and it is the contention of respondent that because thereof the appeal is too late. In support of his contention respondent has cited several cases in his brief and in a subsequent memorandum, but in none of these cases is the question involved herein decided. Whatever language found therein apparently favorable to respondentÃ¢ÂÂs position must be considered in relation to the situation before the respective courts and in none of them has it been decided that the time for appeal from a judgment (sixty days in the present case) has been curtailed. In most of the cases it appears that the primary limitation of time for appeal had expired and that the proceedings taken by the appellants there were in effect an attempt to enlarge the time of appeal beyond the statutory period, which the upper courts held could not be so accomplished. There is no case that we have been able to find which in its holding curtails the statutory time of appeal, and practically all of these cases construe the effect of the statutory language of section 939, which deals with appeals from the superior court, as extending the time of appeal beyond the limitation of the statute to a period thirty days from the date of the termination of the motion for new trial. (See Bates v. Ransome-Crummey Co., 42 Cal.App. 699 [184 P. 39]; Jackson v. Dolan, 202 Cal. 468 [261 P. 706]; Deacon v. Deacon, 201 Cal. 190 [255 P. 798].)
*985In Rainey v. Crowder, 131 Cal.App. 562 [21 P.2d 593, 594], a motion for new trial was heard and determined within the sixty-day period provided for appeals from judgments. Notice of appeal was given by defendants after the primary time for appeal had expired but within the extension period provided by section 939, Code of Civil Procedure. The appellate court, holding that the appeal was timely, made the following observation: Ã¢ÂÂWe think that the statute as written reasonably allows a construction which will in all instances fully preserve the right of a party who promptly has made his motion for a new trial, to have the benefit of the extension of time, not exceeding thirty days, for taking his appeal.Ã¢ÂÂ (Emphasis ours.)
It is our opinion that, in enacting sections 939 and 983a, Code of Civil Procedure, which, though different in language, are similar in meaning, the Legislature had no intention of curtailing or reducing the time within which an appeal from a judgment may be taken but were providing for an extension of such time under the conditions set forth in these sections.
The notice of appeal having been given within the sixty-day limitation is timely and respondentÃ¢ÂÂs motion to dismiss should therefore be denied.

The defendant Del Mar Corporation was conducting a game .known as Bingo in a room on the fourth floor of a building in the city of Santa Monica. It was stipulated that the game as played constituted a lottery under the law of this state. The property to be thus distributed was War Savings Stamps and money.
It was also stipulated that the room where the game was being played was equipped with chairs, tables, wheels, counter, cards, and discs, sufficient in number to accommodate 96 players ; that during the progress of the game some of the players were seated on chairs at a long rectangular counter and others were seated at small tables on the outer edge of the room; that an electrically operated wheel was located near the wall of one end of the room; that said wheel was approximately 6 feet in diameter; that on the face of the wheel around its outer circumference arranged promiscuously and not consecutively appeared the numbers from 1 to 75, inclusive; that certain cards, which had upon their face 24 numerals selected promiscuously from among the numerals 1 to 75, inclusive, arranged in five rows of five numerals each, except that the middle space in the middle row was left blank, were provided for the players upon their paying the required consideration; and that the play of the game proceeded by an operator (employed by defendant) starting the wheel revolving, which continued spinning until it came to rest at random, then indicating by an electric light one of the numerals upon the face of the wheel. It also appeared that there was a loud speaker in the corner of the room and a microphone near the control board, and an indicator board at one end of the room, about 4 feet by 20 feet, where the number on which the wheel stopped would be shown. This room was about 40 feet by 60 feet. The game was operated by three employees of defendant. One employee operated the wheel and the other two collected the money from the players and distributed the prizes. It further appears that the game was in progress night after night, as well as at least during some of the afternoons, and for periods of several consecutive hours. The management always provided the operators with about $500 in War Savings Stamps and $100 in money. It took only seven or eight minutes to go through the necessary routine to-determine who was entitled to a particular prize. The prizes varied from $2.00 to *Supp. 856$10.00 according to the number of players participating in the game. They were paid in War Savings Stamps, or when a prize was split between several persons in such manner that the denominations of stamps on hand would not equal each personÃ¢ÂÂs share, money was paid for the difference.
During the progress of the game deputies from the sheriffÃ¢ÂÂs office seized the stamps and money which had been provided by the defendant corporation for carrying on the game and which were then in the possession of the employees who were operating it. This action was then brought in the name of the People under section 325, Penal Code, to have said stamps and money forfeited to the state. The material part of this Penal Code section reads as follows: Ã¢ÂÂAll moneys and property offered for sale or distribution in violation of any of the provisions of this chapter are forfeited to the state, ...Ã¢ÂÂ (Italics added.) The code sections which make Bingo a lottery are in the same chapter of the Penal Code as section 325. The trial court rendered judgment for the defendant corporation. The plaintiff has appealed.
Counsel for defendant corporation argue that only the stamps and money which made up the particular prize that was being played for at the moment the seizure by the officers took place were forfeited; that the other stamps and money there in the room in the possession of the operators of the game were not subject to forfeiture. This latter conclusion is based on the theory that such stamps and money were not Ã¢ÂÂoffered for . . . distribution.Ã¢ÂÂ This theory and the conclusion based thereon are not sound.
In Asher v. Johnson (1938), 26 Cal.App.2d 403 [79 P.2d 457] the court, in'discussing tango (which in purpose, though not in technique, appears to be at least a first cousin of BingÃÂ³) observed (pp. 411-12) that Ã¢ÂÂIt may not be reasonably said the game terminates when an unlucky victim plays five balls and loses. It is evident from the large receipts that the games continue.Ã¢ÂÂ (Italics added.) In like manner it is evident from the spaciousness of defendantÃ¢ÂÂs quarters, the elaborateness with which they are equipped, the mechanical and electrical devices provided, the number of employees, the amount of money and War Savings Stamps provided for each session of play, the length and regularity of the sessionsÃ¢ÂÂin fact, from defendantÃ¢ÂÂs entire setupÃ¢ÂÂthat the game does not ter*Supp. 857mÃÂ­nate when the winner of a particular prize has been determined.
If, however, it may be said that the determination of the player entitled to a particular prize constitutes a game, it is obvious that all the elaborate and expensive setup was not gotten together for the purpose of playing just a single game. It of course contemplates a repetition of the routine so long as the place stays open and there are sufficient participating patrons, and a resumption of it when the place reopens the next afternoon or evening, and so on ad infinitum. It represents a business enterprise just as much as a grocery store does. The equipment here corresponds to the counters, showcases, scales, etc., of the grocery store. The War Savings Stamps and money constitute the stock-in-trade just as the cans on the grocerÃ¢ÂÂs shelves constitute part of his stock-in-trade. Each can of merchandise is being offered for sale by the grocer even while it is still on his shelves. The goods are offered for sale without an overt act or solicitation on his part. (State v. Dunbar (1886), 13 Ore. 591 [11 P. 298, 57 Am.Rep. 33; People v. Lewis (1910), 138 App.Div. 673 [122 N.Y.S. 1025].) Likewise here the stamps and money in the gaming room were being offered for distribution as prizes. True, they might not all be thus' distributed because there might not be enough patrons playing long enough to accomplish this result. But the stamps and money were nevertheless offered for distribution just as much as the unsold cans have been offered for sale during the day when the grocer closes his store at night.
The employees of defendant corporation thoroughly understood that at least the War Savings Stamps were a part of their stock-in-trade for distribution. Jeanne Chevalier (one of such employees) testified on cross-examination as follows: Ã¢ÂÂQ. These stamps that you brought up there were to be used by you in paying off winners of these games ? Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂA. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs right, yes.Ã¢ÂÂ
Ã¢ÂÂQ. You brought them [the War Savings Stamps] up there for the purpose of distributing them to winners?
Ã¢ÂÂA. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs right, yes, I did.
Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ Q. Of this Bingo game, did you not ?
Ã¢ÂÂA. Yes.Ã¢ÂÂ
It is suggested that under such an interpretation of the code section (Pen. Code, ÃÂ§ 325) the money downstairs in defendantÃ¢ÂÂs safe would be subject to seizure and forfeiture. *Supp. 858This of course is not true. Such funds would not have been appropriated to the game and, not being at the place where the game was being played, would not be a part of the stock-in-trade and consequently would not be offered for distribution as prizes. Such funds would be like the crates of canned goods the grocer still has in the warehouse. They have not yet become a part of his stock and so are not being offered for sale.
To hold that only the stamps and money that are to be given as a prize at the conclusion of one of these seven or eight-minute routine operations is all that is being offered is to ignore the physical setup and the practical operation of this game.
The judgment and order denying a motion for a new trial are reversed and the case is remanded for a new trial, appellant to recover its costs on appeal.
Shaw, P. J., concurred.

I dissent. The trial court has impliedly found that the money and War Savings Stamps confiscated by plaintiff from the possession of defendant were not offered for sale or distribution, as required by section 325, Penal Code, as a basis for its forfeiture. Viewing the evidence, as we must, most favorably in support of the judgment, we find that the bulk of the War Savings Stamps and money in question was contained in a metal box which was kept behind a glassed-off compartment of the gaming room where bookkeeping was conducted. The winners of each game, the prize for which was from $2.00 to $10.00 in stamps, depending upon the number of players and the amount played, were paid off in stamps from the pockets of aprons worn by the attendants. The only stamps or money offered for sale or distribution were the actual prizes put up for each game. Such attendants would replenish their aprons with stamps from the box when necessary.
The evidence further shows that stamps from the box were sold to patrons, club members and employees aside from the gaming; that $100 of the money in question was supplied by the auditor to make change and that the box was kept in the club safe downstairs when the games were not in session. Such evidence is sufficient to support the courtÃ¢ÂÂs implied finding *Supp. 859that the stamps and money in question were not offered for sale or distribution as required by section 325, Penal Code.
It is well settled that Ã¢ÂÂ. . . a statute imposing a forfeiture should be construed strictly, and in a manner as favorable to the person whose property is to be seized as is consistent with the fair principles of interpretation. The courts will usually give such a construction to statutes providing for forfeiture as will be consistent with justice and the dictates of natural reason.Ã¢ÂÂ (People v. One 1939 Plymouth 6 Coupe, (1940), 41 Cal.App.2d 559, 562 [107 P.2d 266].) The instant case is not within the rule laid down in the case of Schur v. Johnson (1934), 2 Cal.App.2d 680, 683 [38 P.2d 844], nor is the trial courtÃ¢ÂÂs holding violative of the principle there enunciated that 1 2**5Ã¢ÂÂ Courts will not lend their aid to transactions founded on illegal contracts or acts in violation of law.Ã¢ÂÂ See Niccoli v. McClelland (1937), 21 Cal.App.2dSupp. 759, 765 [65 P.2d 853]; Asher v. Johnson (1938), 26 Cal.App.2d 403, 410 [79 P.2d 457].
