       "'\\nCLEMENT, J.*\\nDefendants herein demurred to plaintiffÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x99s complaint on the ground that it fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend and entered judgment for defendants. Plaintiff appeals.\\nIn the complaint the following facts are alleged:\\nThe 1952 Fresno County grand jury made court approved contract on April 28,1952, with defendants to examine books, records and accounts as authorized by Penal Code, section 928. The agreed compensation was not to exceed the sum of $10,000 Ã¢Â\\x80Â\\x9cprovided that in case it appeared reasonable *Supp. 890and expedient to continue any audit or investigation past the limit of $10,000 the same might be done only on the approval of the Grand Jury and the Superior Court.Ã¢Â\\x80Â\\x9d\\nThereafter without court approved agreement for additional compensation defendants rendered their claim for $1,516.07 in excess of the agreed maximum of $10,000. The complaint further alleges that defendants Ã¢Â\\x80Â\\x9centered upon an examination and investigation of the equipment needs of certain offices of the County of FresnoÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x94and upon completion thereof rendered their claim and bill in the sum of $749.91 for such investigation and the expenses of travel in connection therewith . . .\\nÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x9cThat thereafter . . . and on the 26th day of January, 1953, Honorable Strother P. Walton, Judge of the Superior Court of the State of California, in and for the County of Fresno issued an order increasing the amount authorized in the said contract aforesaid from the $10,000 limit therein contained to $12,265.98, which said amount of increase included both the additional sum of $1,516.07 as and for an examination of the books, records and accounts herein referred to and the sum of $749.91 for the special examination and investigation of the equipment needs hereinabove referred to . . .\\nÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x9cThat on the 26th day of January, 1953 (the same day and presumably at the same time and as a part of the same official act) the Honorable Strother P. Walton, Judge of the Superior Court issued his written order directing the auditor of the County of Fresno to pay to said defendants the sum of $5,284.32, which sadd sum included both the sum of $1,516.07 and the sum of $749.91 hereinabove referred to.Ã¢Â\\x80Â\\x9d\\nThereafter pursuant to the written order of the court said sums were paid by the auditor. The judgment prays for the return to the county of $2,269.98 unlawfully paid and $453.19 damages.\\nUnfortunately the order increasing the amount to be paid and the order directing payment were not set out in the complaint m haec verba, but it is a fair inference from the allegations of the complaint that the order for an increase and the order for payment constituted one official act and in legal contemplation but one order.\\nAppellant contends that the claims of the defendants, insofar as they exceeded the amount provided for in the original contract of employment as approved by the superior court are illegal and not proper county charges. It further contends *Supp. 891that the mere fact that the moneys herein sued for were paid by the treasurer under an order of the court increasing the amount of grand jury contract, and an order directing that payment does not foreclose an action of this kind to recover the same. Appellant also contends that even if the order to pay referred to in the complaint is determined to be a Ã¢Â\\x80Â\\x9cjudicial orderÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x9d of the court, it may, nevertheless, be attacked in an action of this nature.\\nRespondents contend that the order of the court was a Ã¢Â\\x80Â\\x9cjudicial orderÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x9d and that such an order may not be the subject of collateral attack unless the invalidity of the order appears on its face.\\nThe sole point involved in this appeal and. to be determined by this court is whether or not the judge of the superior court had jurisdiction to make the order of the 26th of January, 1953 pursuant to section 928 of the Penal Code, which will be considered in detail later in this opinion.\\nA collateral attack on a judgment is an attempt to impeach a judgment by matters dehors the record in an action other than that in which it was rendered. It is an attempt to avoid the effect of a judgment or order perhaps made in some other proceeding. (Clark v. Deschamps, 109 Cal.App.2d 765 at 769 [241 P.2d 681]; Nielsen v. Emerson, 119 Cal.App. 214 [6 P.2d 281]; Rico v. Nasser Bros. Realty Co., 58 Cal.App.2d 878 [137 P.2d 861].)\\nA direct attack is one within the proceeding itself, taken within the time and according to the plan provided by law; for example, motions for a new trial, appeal and motions to set aside the judgment in the manner provided by Code of Civil Procedure, section 473. (City of Los Angeles v. Glassell, 203 Cal. 44 at 49 [262 P. 1084]; Macbeth v. Macbeth, 219 Cal. 47 [25 P.2d 11].)\\nInsofar as judgments which do not show invalidity on their face are concerned, the main difference between the direct and collateral attack is that in the direct attack the true facts may be shown, while in the ease of collateral attack we are confined to the inspection of a record conclusively presumed to be correct. (City of Los Angeles v. Glassell, supra.)\\nBefore 1917 a judge of the superior court had no auditing power respecting claims of this character, and could not compel, by direct order, that the auditor draw warrants for payment of the same. (Woody v. Peairs, 35 Cal.App. 553 [170 P. 660]; White v. Mathews, 29 Cal.App. 634 [156 P. 372].)\\n*Supp. 892In 1917 there was, however, added to section 928, as it then stood, the following language: Ã¢Â\\x80Â\\x9cAny and all expenses incurred under this section, and also the per diem and mileage where allowed by law, of the grand jurors, shall be paid by the Treasurer of the County out of the general fund of said County upon warrants drawn by the County Auditor upon the written order of the Judge of the Superior Court in said County.Ã¢Â\\x80Â\\x9d\\nWhen the law expressly confers upon the judge or magistrate the power to order the claims paid, such judge or magistrate is then himself the auditor of the claim, and if the judge has authority to make such order the action of the judge, in the absence of fraud, is conclusive and stands in the same position as any other judicial judgment or order. (Woody v. Peairs, supra; White v. Mathews, supra.)\\nWe are satisfied that the order which is the subject of dispute in this action was in the nature of a judicial order, and that it cannot be attacked in the manner in which plaintiff here seeks to attack it, unless some defect appears on its face which would show some character of invalidity. It is, therefore, necessary to carefully examine the language of section 928 to ascertain whether any such invalidity appears.\\nThat portion of section 928 of the Penal Code with which we are here specially concerned reads as follows:\\nÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x9cIt shall be the duty of the Grand Jury annually to make a \"careful and complete examination of the books, records and accounts of all the officers of the county, and of every city board of education within the county, and especially those pertaining to the revenue, and report as to the facts they have found, with such recommendations as they, may deem proper and fit; and if, in their judgment, the services of an expert are necessary, they shall have power to employ one, at an agreed compensation, to be first approved by the court; and if, in their judgment, the services of assistants to such expert are required, they shall have power to employ such, at a compensation to be agreed upon and approved by the court.\\nÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x9cIt shall be the duty of every grand jury first impaneled in even numbered years to investigate and report upon the needs for increase or decrease in salaries of the county supervisors, the district attorney and the auditor, and it shall cause a copy of such report to be transmitted to each member of the Legislature representing the county in which it has been impaneled before the commencement of the regular *Supp. 893session of the Legislature in odd numbered years. It shall also be the duty of every grand jury to investigate and report upon the needs of all county officers in its county, including the abolition or creation of offices and the equipment for, or the method or system of performing the duties of, the several offices, and it shall cause a copy of such report to be transmitted to each member of the board of supervisors in its county.Ã¢Â\\x80Â\\x9d (Emphasis added.)\\nSection 928 of the Penal Code is cast into five (5) paragraphs and it will be seen that the first paragraph relates solely to the examination of books, records and accounts. It will be further noted that this first paragraph is all in one sentence, and that the portion relating to the employment of an expert is a part of that sentence. By the doctrine of ejusdem generis, the portion providing power to employ an expert indubitably relates back to and receives its identifying generia from the subject with which the sentence is started.\\nIt will be further noted that the thought content of paragraph two relates to the needs of county officers, including their equipment. This paragraph is complete in itself and contains no reference of any. kind to the employment of an expert.\\nAn examination of the legislative history of grand juries in California compels a conclusion that the Legislature has regularly followed a practice of defining and delimiting the powers of the grand jury in relation to employment of others. (Allen v. Payne, 1 Cal.2d 607 at 608 [36 P.2d 614]; Woody v. Peairs, supra.)\\nWe have examined the statutes of California carefully, and we have not found anything which we consider authority for the employment by the grand jury of an expert to examine and investigate the equipment needs of county officers.\\nIn Allen v. Payne, 1 Cal.2d 607, 608 [36 P.2d 614] the court in holding that grand juries have no inherent or implied powers to contract services in connection with their investigation held Ã¢Â\\x80Â\\x9cThis conclusion is reinforced by an examination of the legislative history of the grand jury in this state, in the light of established rules of statutory construction. That examination reveals a practice of defining and delimiting its powers in relation to employment, by express statutory grant. ... It seems clear . . . that the legislature has considered the employment of persons by grand jury a matter to be governed by statute.Ã¢Â\\x80Â\\x9d\\nA reading of section 928 of the Penal Code as here*Supp. 894inabove set out fails to show any authority whatever, for the grand jury to employ experts to examine and investigate Ã¢Â\\x80Â\\x9cthe equipment needs of certain offices of the County of Fresno. Ã¢Â\\x80Â\\x99 Ã¢Â\\x80Â\\x99\\nWhatever power the judge had to make the order in the case before us derives from said section 928. The power of the judge to make the order depended on the power of the grand jury to incur the expenses covered by it.\\nSo far as the order authorizing an increase in the amount in excess of $10,000 was for services authorized by section 928 it is not subject to collateral attack, but as to the item of $749.91 for the examination and investigation of the equipment needs of certain offices of the County of Fresno it is void on its face as having been made without jurisdiction for the simple reason that there was no authority in section 928 for the grand jury to contract for these services.\\nThe judgment appealed from is reversed and the cause remanded to the trial court for proceedings in accordance with the views expressed herein.\\n\\nÃ\\x83Â¡\\n\\nShepard, P. J., and Kellas, J., concurred.\\n'"

       "\"\\nQUAYLE, J.\\nDefendant appeals from judgments of conviction on both counts of a complaint which contains the following charges: Count One—On or about February 1, 1961, he carried on his profession of practice of the law in the City of Oakland without the license prescribed by section 5-1.02 of the Oakland Municipal Code thereby violating section 16240 of the California Business and Professions Code, a misdemeanor. Count Two—On or about February 1, 1961, he practiced law in the City of Oakland without the license prescribed by section 5-1.02 of the Oakland Municipal Code thereby committing a misdemeanor under the penal provisions of said code. He admits that he practiced law at that time and place without obtaining such a license. The only issues raised are:\\n1. Do the penal provisions in the Oakland Business Licensing Law render it invalid ?\\n2. Do the convictions constitute double punishment for a single act on appellant’s part?\\nIs the Oakland Business Licensing Law Valid ?\\nAppellant concedes that the City of Oakland may collect a tax from him for practicing law within the city and that a proper ordinance could be enacted to effect the raising of revenue by such means (In re Groves, 54 Cal.2d 154 [4 Cal.Rptr. 844, 351 P.2d 1028]). But he contends that the Oakland Business Licensing Law, purporting to be a revenue measure, is in fact a regulation of the practice of the law in that city.\\nThe State of California has preempted the field of regulating and licensing persons entitled to practice law within the state (Bus. & Prof. Code, § 6000 et seq.). Under such circumstances no city can impose restrictions upon persons duly licensed by the state, except to require them to pay a tax for the privilege of maintaining within the city a place in which, or from which, they practice their profession. Any other restriction would conflict with the general law of the state (Cal. Const., art. XI, § 11; Franklin v. Peterson, 87 Cal.App.2d 727, 732 [197 P.2d 788]).\\nMunicipal ordinances have been held invalid where qualifications or tests have been required, other than the possession *915of a license to carry on the business or profession duly issued by the state. (See Horwith v. City of Fresno, 74 Cal.App.2d 443 [168 P.2d 767]; City & County of San Francisco v. Boss, 83 Cal.App.2d 445 [189 P.2d 32]; Lynch v. City of Los Angeles, 114 Cal.App.2d 115 [249 P.2d 856]; Agnew v. City of Los Angeles, 51 Cal.2d 1 [330 P.2d 385]; Agnew v. Culver City, 147 Cal.App.2d 144 [304 P.2d 788].) Therefore, we must accept as settled law that to uphold the validity of the ordinance in question it must be found to be, in fact, a purely revenue measure.\\nThe ordinance professes, on its face, to be a revenue measure. Section 5-1.04 provides: “The term ‘license’ as used in this Article shall not be construed to mean a permit. The fees prescribed by this Article constitute a tax for revenue purposes, and are not regulatory permit fees.”\\nSection 5-1.02 referred to in both counts of the complaint provides: “License Required.—It shall be unlawful for any person either for himself or for any other person, to commence or carry on any business in this Article specified, in the City of Oakland, without first having procured a license from said city so to do, or without complying with any and all regulations of such business contained in this Article; and the carrying on of any business without first having procured a license from said city so to do, or without complying with any and all regulations of this Article, shall constitute a separate violation of this Code for each and every day that such a business is so carried on.” No other provisions of the article therein referred to affects the practice of law except section 5-1.29, which specifies the amount of license fee to be paid by professional men doing business within the city.\\nSection 16240 of the Business and Professions Code provides: “Engaging in business, etc., without license: Misdemeanor. Every person who commences or carries on any business, trade, profession, or calling, for the transaction or carrying on of which a license is required by any law of this State, without taking out or procuring the license prescribed by such law, is guilty of a misdemeanor.”\\nA city ordinance is a law of this state within the meaning of this section of the Business and Professions Code (formerly Pen. Code, § 435). In re Sweetman, 5 Cal.App. 577 [90 P. 1069]; In re Johnson, 47 Cal.App. 465 [190 P. 852]. But obviously a conviction under this provision of the state law would fail if the city ordinance relied on was invalid.\\n*916Section 1-3.01 of the Oakland Municipal Code provides: “Violations, A Misdemeanor. Any person violating any of the provisions or failing to comply with any of the regulatory requirements of this Code, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. Any person convicted of a misdemeanor under the provisions of this code shall be punishable by a fine of not more than $500.00 or by imprisonment in the City Prison for a period of not more than six months, or by both such fine and imprisonment. ’ ’\\nAppellant cites cases where local ordinances have been held to be invalid where municipalities have sought to punish under local law, acts which are punishable by state law. Analysis of these eases reveals that each was an attempt to invade a field which had been preempted by the general law of the state. In re Portnoy, 21 Cal.2d 237 [131 P.2d 1], involves an attempt by the County of Riverside to make possession of a slot machine a misdemeanor. Such was already declared by the state to be a misdemeanor under section 330a of the Penal Code. Pipoly v. Benson, 20 Cal.2d 366 [125 P.2d 482, 147 A.L.R. 515], involves an attempt by the City of Los Angeles to impose additional traffic regulations to control public roadways in conflict with the California Vehicle Code. This would invade a field fully preempted by the state. The Oakland ordinance has none of the objectionable features discussed in these cases.\\nSection 37100 of the Government Code empowers municipal bodies to “pass ordinances not in conflict with the Constitution and laws of the State or the United States.” Section 37101 of that code empowers them to “license, for revenue and regulation, and fix the license tax upon, every kind of lawful business transacted in the city, including shows, exhibitions, and games.”\\nIn re Groves, 54 Cal.2d 154 [4 Cal.Rptr. 844, 351 P.2d 1028], at page 156, states: “Whether or not state law has occupied the field of regulation, cities may tax business carried on within their boundaries and enforce such taxes by requiring business licenses for revenue and by criminal penalties.” (Emphasis added.)\\nIt has been pointed out that the Palm Springs ordinance involved in the Groves case differs from the Oakland ordinance in that the former expressly provides that “The criminal penalties provided for by this Code shall not be applied to businesses or professions requiring a State license as a condition precedent to doing business in the City, nor, as a *917method of obtaining collection of the license fees.” The Oakland ordinance specifically makes doing business without a city license a misdemeanor and specifies the penalty.\\nAppellant contends that by this device he can be incarcerated for failure to pay the tax and thus prevented from practicing law although he is duly licensed to do so by the state. Claiming that this, in effect, is regulative he cited two eases. But they are readily distinguished from the case at bar. City of Sonora v. Curtin, 137 Cal. 583 [70 P. 674], declares that the city’s authority to license attorneys falls under its taxing power and not its police power; the ordinance in question provides that “every lawyer shall pay a license”; this is a tax upon the person because he is a lawyer, which makes it invalid. It is to be distinguished from a license tax upon the business of practicing law which would be valid. (In re Johnson, 47 Cal.App. 465, 469 [190 P. 852].) City of San Mateo v. Mullin, 59 Cal.App.2d 652 [139 P.2d 351], declares that a business license law that fixes the tax in an unreasonable or arbitrary manner or which inadequately defines the subject of the tax is vulnerable to attack; but it held the San Mateo business licensing law to be a valid revenue measure.\\nThe Supreme Court, in the Groves case, indicated that the applicable law was set forth in the habeas corpus proceedings brought by an attorney jailed in Los Angeles for practicing law without paying that city’s business license tax.  In re Galusha, 184 Cal. 697, 699 [195 P. 406] :\\n“As in the case of other professions or businesses which can be taxed by the state, the cases hold that the state can delegate to a municipality the power to impose a tax for the privilege of following the practice of the profession within the jurisdiction of the municipality. [Citations.]  The imposition of an occupational tax by a municipality upon those engaged in the practice of the legal profession is not an interference with state affairs.  The mere compliance with certain prerequisites, in return for which a license to practice law is granted by the state, does not place a person beyond the range of additional regulation of the conditions upon which the license may be used.  The municipality, in imposing an occupational tax upon attorneys, is not interfering with state regulations, for it is not attempting to prescribe qualifications for attorneys different from or additional to those prescribed by the state. It is merely providing for an increase in its revenue by imposing a tax upon those who, by pursuing their profession within its limits, are *918deriving benefits from the advantages especially afforded by the city. The tax is levied upon the business of practicing law, rather than upon a person because he is an attorney at law. [Citation.]  A license to practice does not carry with it exemption from taxation.”\\nConcurrent with the decision in the Galusha case, the Supreme Court upheld a conviction under the penal provisions of the Los Angeles business license law in another case. (In re Nowak, 184 Cal. 701 [195 P. 402].)\\nIn re Johnson, 47 Cal.App. 465 [190 P. 852], involved a situation similar to the case at bar. Johnson had been convicted under the Marysville business license law which contained penal provisions. The court held that it was immaterial whether or not the city had such power or attempted to assert such power because the ordinance was deemed to be a law of the state and could be enforced as a misdemeanor under section 435 of the Penal Code. This Penal Code section was later repealed and is now embodied in section 16240 of the Business and Professions Code.  To the same effect see In re Diehl, 8 Cal.App. 51 [96 P. 98], and Ex parte Heylman, 92 Cal. 492 [28 P. 675], where city ordinances imposing business taxes and providing penal provisions for enforcing them were held to be valid.\\nTherefore the Oakland Business Licensing Law as set forth in its Municipal Code is valid and supports the conviction of Appellant for violating section 16240 of the Business and Professions Code as charged in Count One.\\nDoes Conviction and Sentence on Count Two Constitute Double Punishment?\\nThe record reveals that the trial court found appellant 'guilty on both counts of the complaint and fined him $105 or 20 days in the county jail on each count, to be served concurrently. The only conduct of appellant referred to in either count was practicing law in Oakland on or about February 1, 1961, without the license required under that city’s business licensing law. Having been convicted and sentenced for violating section 16240 of the Business and Professions Code in Count One, is it not double punishment to convict and sentence the Appellant under the penal provisions of the Oakland Municipal Code for the same conduct in Count Two?\\nSection 654 of the Penal Code provides that a single act by a‘defendant cannot be punished more than once.\\n“Punishment for two offenses arising from the same act is prohibited by the constitutional and common-law rule *919against multiple punishment for necessarily included offenses [citations] and by Penal Code, section 654, which provides that ‘an act or omission which is made punishable in different ways by different provisions of this code may be punishable under either of such provisions, but in no ease can it be punished under more than one.’ . . . Whether a course of criminal conduct is divisible and therefore gives rise to more than one act within the meaning of section 654 depends on the intent and objective of the actor. If all the offenses were incident to one objective, the defendant may be punished for any one of such offenses but not for more than one.” (Neal v. State of California, 55 Cal.2d 11, 18, 19 [9 Cal.Rptr. 607, 357 P.2d 839].)\\nIf appellant had been charged with violating the provisions of the business licensing law at some other time in Count Two, some justification for the second conviction might be found. But certainly the record here shows no such factual situation.\\nSection 654 of the Penal Code refers to “ [a]n act or omission which is made punishable in different ways by different provisions of this code ...” (emphasis added). Neither charge here is based upon violations of the Penal Code. Count One is based on the Business and Professions Code. Count Two is based on the Oakland Municipal Code. However, the legal principal involved is one based upon fundamental justice and the common law (People v. Tideman, 57 Cal.2d 574 [21 Cal.Rptr. 207, 370 P.2d 1007]).  The legislative intent expressed in section 654 is to prevent double punishment whether the crime is defined in the Penal Code or any other law of the state that properly defines a crime.\\n‘‘If only a single act is charged as the basis of the multiple convictions, only one conviction can be affirmed, notwithstanding that the offenses are not necessarily included offenses. It is the singleness of the act and not of the offense that is determinative.” (People v. Knowles, 35 Cal.2d 175, 187 [217 P.2d 1].)  Therefore the conviction and sentence on Count Two constitutes double punishment for the same act on appellant’s part and should not be permitted to stand.\\nThe judgment and sentence in Count One is affirmed. The judgment and sentence in Count Two is reversed with directions that said count be dismissed.\\nWagler, P. J., and Chamberlain, J., concurred.\\n\""

       "'\\nCLEMENT, J.*\\nDefendants herein demurred to plaintiff\\'s complaint on the ground that it fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend and entered judgment for defendants. Plaintiff appeals.\\nIn the complaint the following facts are alleged:\\nThe 1952 Fresno County grand jury made court approved contract on April 28,1952, with defendants to examine books, records and accounts as authorized by Penal Code, section 928. The agreed compensation was not to exceed the sum of $10,000 “provided that in case it appeared reasonable *Supp. 890and expedient to continue any audit or investigation past the limit of $10,000 the same might be done only on the approval of the Grand Jury and the Superior Court.”\\nThereafter without court approved agreement for additional compensation defendants rendered their claim for $1,516.07 in excess of the agreed maximum of $10,000. The complaint further alleges that defendants “entered upon an examination and investigation of the equipment needs of certain offices of the County of Fresno—and upon completion thereof rendered their claim and bill in the sum of $749.91 for such investigation and the expenses of travel in connection therewith . . .\\n“That thereafter . . . and on the 26th day of January, 1953, Honorable Strother P. Walton, Judge of the Superior Court of the State of California, in and for the County of Fresno issued an order increasing the amount authorized in the said contract aforesaid from the $10,000 limit therein contained to $12,265.98, which said amount of increase included both the additional sum of $1,516.07 as and for an examination of the books, records and accounts herein referred to and the sum of $749.91 for the special examination and investigation of the equipment needs hereinabove referred to . . .\\n“That on the 26th day of January, 1953 (the same day and presumably at the same time and as a part of the same official act) the Honorable Strother P. Walton, Judge of the Superior Court issued his written order directing the auditor of the County of Fresno to pay to said defendants the sum of $5,284.32, which sadd sum included both the sum of $1,516.07 and the sum of $749.91 hereinabove referred to.”\\nThereafter pursuant to the written order of the court said sums were paid by the auditor. The judgment prays for the return to the county of $2,269.98 unlawfully paid and $453.19 damages.\\nUnfortunately the order increasing the amount to be paid and the order directing payment were not set out in the complaint m haec verba, but it is a fair inference from the allegations of the complaint that the order for an increase and the order for payment constituted one official act and in legal contemplation but one order.\\nAppellant contends that the claims of the defendants, insofar as they exceeded the amount provided for in the original contract of employment as approved by the superior court are illegal and not proper county charges. It further contends *Supp. 891that the mere fact that the moneys herein sued for were paid by the treasurer under an order of the court increasing the amount of grand jury contract, and an order directing that payment does not foreclose an action of this kind to recover the same. Appellant also contends that even if the order to pay referred to in the complaint is determined to be a “judicial order” of the court, it may, nevertheless, be attacked in an action of this nature.\\nRespondents contend that the order of the court was a “judicial order” and that such an order may not be the subject of collateral attack unless the invalidity of the order appears on its face.\\nThe sole point involved in this appeal and. to be determined by this court is whether or not the judge of the superior court had jurisdiction to make the order of the 26th of January, 1953 pursuant to section 928 of the Penal Code, which will be considered in detail later in this opinion.\\nA collateral attack on a judgment is an attempt to impeach a judgment by matters dehors the record in an action other than that in which it was rendered. It is an attempt to avoid the effect of a judgment or order perhaps made in some other proceeding. (Clark v. Deschamps, 109 Cal.App.2d 765 at 769 [241 P.2d 681]; Nielsen v. Emerson, 119 Cal.App. 214 [6 P.2d 281]; Rico v. Nasser Bros. Realty Co., 58 Cal.App.2d 878 [137 P.2d 861].)\\nA direct attack is one within the proceeding itself, taken within the time and according to the plan provided by law; for example, motions for a new trial, appeal and motions to set aside the judgment in the manner provided by Code of Civil Procedure, section 473. (City of Los Angeles v. Glassell, 203 Cal. 44 at 49 [262 P. 1084]; Macbeth v. Macbeth, 219 Cal. 47 [25 P.2d 11].)\\nInsofar as judgments which do not show invalidity on their face are concerned, the main difference between the direct and collateral attack is that in the direct attack the true facts may be shown, while in the ease of collateral attack we are confined to the inspection of a record conclusively presumed to be correct. (City of Los Angeles v. Glassell, supra.)\\nBefore 1917 a judge of the superior court had no auditing power respecting claims of this character, and could not compel, by direct order, that the auditor draw warrants for payment of the same. (Woody v. Peairs, 35 Cal.App. 553 [170 P. 660]; White v. Mathews, 29 Cal.App. 634 [156 P. 372].)\\n*Supp. 892In 1917 there was, however, added to section 928, as it then stood, the following language: “Any and all expenses incurred under this section, and also the per diem and mileage where allowed by law, of the grand jurors, shall be paid by the Treasurer of the County out of the general fund of said County upon warrants drawn by the County Auditor upon the written order of the Judge of the Superior Court in said County.”\\nWhen the law expressly confers upon the judge or magistrate the power to order the claims paid, such judge or magistrate is then himself the auditor of the claim, and if the judge has authority to make such order the action of the judge, in the absence of fraud, is conclusive and stands in the same position as any other judicial judgment or order. (Woody v. Peairs, supra; White v. Mathews, supra.)\\nWe are satisfied that the order which is the subject of dispute in this action was in the nature of a judicial order, and that it cannot be attacked in the manner in which plaintiff here seeks to attack it, unless some defect appears on its face which would show some character of invalidity. It is, therefore, necessary to carefully examine the language of section 928 to ascertain whether any such invalidity appears.\\nThat portion of section 928 of the Penal Code with which we are here specially concerned reads as follows:\\n“It shall be the duty of the Grand Jury annually to make a \"careful and complete examination of the books, records and accounts of all the officers of the county, and of every city board of education within the county, and especially those pertaining to the revenue, and report as to the facts they have found, with such recommendations as they, may deem proper and fit; and if, in their judgment, the services of an expert are necessary, they shall have power to employ one, at an agreed compensation, to be first approved by the court; and if, in their judgment, the services of assistants to such expert are required, they shall have power to employ such, at a compensation to be agreed upon and approved by the court.\\n“It shall be the duty of every grand jury first impaneled in even numbered years to investigate and report upon the needs for increase or decrease in salaries of the county supervisors, the district attorney and the auditor, and it shall cause a copy of such report to be transmitted to each member of the Legislature representing the county in which it has been impaneled before the commencement of the regular *Supp. 893session of the Legislature in odd numbered years. It shall also be the duty of every grand jury to investigate and report upon the needs of all county officers in its county, including the abolition or creation of offices and the equipment for, or the method or system of performing the duties of, the several offices, and it shall cause a copy of such report to be transmitted to each member of the board of supervisors in its county.” (Emphasis added.)\\nSection 928 of the Penal Code is cast into five (5) paragraphs and it will be seen that the first paragraph relates solely to the examination of books, records and accounts. It will be further noted that this first paragraph is all in one sentence, and that the portion relating to the employment of an expert is a part of that sentence. By the doctrine of ejusdem generis, the portion providing power to employ an expert indubitably relates back to and receives its identifying generia from the subject with which the sentence is started.\\nIt will be further noted that the thought content of paragraph two relates to the needs of county officers, including their equipment. This paragraph is complete in itself and contains no reference of any. kind to the employment of an expert.\\nAn examination of the legislative history of grand juries in California compels a conclusion that the Legislature has regularly followed a practice of defining and delimiting the powers of the grand jury in relation to employment of others. (Allen v. Payne, 1 Cal.2d 607 at 608 [36 P.2d 614]; Woody v. Peairs, supra.)\\nWe have examined the statutes of California carefully, and we have not found anything which we consider authority for the employment by the grand jury of an expert to examine and investigate the equipment needs of county officers.\\nIn Allen v. Payne, 1 Cal.2d 607, 608 [36 P.2d 614] the court in holding that grand juries have no inherent or implied powers to contract services in connection with their investigation held “This conclusion is reinforced by an examination of the legislative history of the grand jury in this state, in the light of established rules of statutory construction. That examination reveals a practice of defining and delimiting its powers in relation to employment, by express statutory grant. ... It seems clear . . . that the legislature has considered the employment of persons by grand jury a matter to be governed by statute.”\\nA reading of section 928 of the Penal Code as here*Supp. 894inabove set out fails to show any authority whatever, for the grand jury to employ experts to examine and investigate “the equipment needs of certain offices of the County of Fresno. \\' \\'\\nWhatever power the judge had to make the order in the case before us derives from said section 928. The power of the judge to make the order depended on the power of the grand jury to incur the expenses covered by it.\\nSo far as the order authorizing an increase in the amount in excess of $10,000 was for services authorized by section 928 it is not subject to collateral attack, but as to the item of $749.91 for the examination and investigation of the equipment needs of certain offices of the County of Fresno it is void on its face as having been made without jurisdiction for the simple reason that there was no authority in section 928 for the grand jury to contract for these services.\\nThe judgment appealed from is reversed and the cause remanded to the trial court for proceedings in accordance with the views expressed herein.\\n\\nÃ\\x83Â¡\\n\\nShepard, P. J., and Kellas, J., concurred.\\n'"

       "'\\nCLEMENT, J.*\\nDefendants herein demurred to plaintiff’s complaint on the ground that it fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend and entered judgment for defendants. Plaintiff appeals.\\nIn the complaint the following facts are alleged:\\nThe 1952 Fresno County grand jury made court approved contract on April 28,1952, with defendants to examine books, records and accounts as authorized by Penal Code, section 928. The agreed compensation was not to exceed the sum of $10,000 “provided that in case it appeared reasonable *Supp. 890and expedient to continue any audit or investigation past the limit of $10,000 the same might be done only on the approval of the Grand Jury and the Superior Court.”\\nThereafter without court approved agreement for additional compensation defendants rendered their claim for $1,516.07 in excess of the agreed maximum of $10,000. The complaint further alleges that defendants “entered upon an examination and investigation of the equipment needs of certain offices of the County of Fresno—and upon completion thereof rendered their claim and bill in the sum of $749.91 for such investigation and the expenses of travel in connection therewith . . .\\n“That thereafter . . . and on the 26th day of January, 1953, Honorable Strother P. Walton, Judge of the Superior Court of the State of California, in and for the County of Fresno issued an order increasing the amount authorized in the said contract aforesaid from the $10,000 limit therein contained to $12,265.98, which said amount of increase included both the additional sum of $1,516.07 as and for an examination of the books, records and accounts herein referred to and the sum of $749.91 for the special examination and investigation of the equipment needs hereinabove referred to . . .\\n“That on the 26th day of January, 1953 (the same day and presumably at the same time and as a part of the same official act) the Honorable Strother P. Walton, Judge of the Superior Court issued his written order directing the auditor of the County of Fresno to pay to said defendants the sum of $5,284.32, which sadd sum included both the sum of $1,516.07 and the sum of $749.91 hereinabove referred to.”\\nThereafter pursuant to the written order of the court said sums were paid by the auditor. The judgment prays for the return to the county of $2,269.98 unlawfully paid and $453.19 damages.\\nUnfortunately the order increasing the amount to be paid and the order directing payment were not set out in the complaint m haec verba, but it is a fair inference from the allegations of the complaint that the order for an increase and the order for payment constituted one official act and in legal contemplation but one order.\\nAppellant contends that the claims of the defendants, insofar as they exceeded the amount provided for in the original contract of employment as approved by the superior court are illegal and not proper county charges. It further contends *Supp. 891that the mere fact that the moneys herein sued for were paid by the treasurer under an order of the court increasing the amount of grand jury contract, and an order directing that payment does not foreclose an action of this kind to recover the same. Appellant also contends that even if the order to pay referred to in the complaint is determined to be a “judicial order” of the court, it may, nevertheless, be attacked in an action of this nature.\\nRespondents contend that the order of the court was a “judicial order” and that such an order may not be the subject of collateral attack unless the invalidity of the order appears on its face.\\nThe sole point involved in this appeal and. to be determined by this court is whether or not the judge of the superior court had jurisdiction to make the order of the 26th of January, 1953 pursuant to section 928 of the Penal Code, which will be considered in detail later in this opinion.\\nA collateral attack on a judgment is an attempt to impeach a judgment by matters dehors the record in an action other than that in which it was rendered. It is an attempt to avoid the effect of a judgment or order perhaps made in some other proceeding. (Clark v. Deschamps, 109 Cal.App.2d 765 at 769 [241 P.2d 681]; Nielsen v. Emerson, 119 Cal.App. 214 [6 P.2d 281]; Rico v. Nasser Bros. Realty Co., 58 Cal.App.2d 878 [137 P.2d 861].)\\nA direct attack is one within the proceeding itself, taken within the time and according to the plan provided by law; for example, motions for a new trial, appeal and motions to set aside the judgment in the manner provided by Code of Civil Procedure, section 473. (City of Los Angeles v. Glassell, 203 Cal. 44 at 49 [262 P. 1084]; Macbeth v. Macbeth, 219 Cal. 47 [25 P.2d 11].)\\nInsofar as judgments which do not show invalidity on their face are concerned, the main difference between the direct and collateral attack is that in the direct attack the true facts may be shown, while in the ease of collateral attack we are confined to the inspection of a record conclusively presumed to be correct. (City of Los Angeles v. Glassell, supra.)\\nBefore 1917 a judge of the superior court had no auditing power respecting claims of this character, and could not compel, by direct order, that the auditor draw warrants for payment of the same. (Woody v. Peairs, 35 Cal.App. 553 [170 P. 660]; White v. Mathews, 29 Cal.App. 634 [156 P. 372].)\\n*Supp. 892In 1917 there was, however, added to section 928, as it then stood, the following language: “Any and all expenses incurred under this section, and also the per diem and mileage where allowed by law, of the grand jurors, shall be paid by the Treasurer of the County out of the general fund of said County upon warrants drawn by the County Auditor upon the written order of the Judge of the Superior Court in said County.”\\nWhen the law expressly confers upon the judge or magistrate the power to order the claims paid, such judge or magistrate is then himself the auditor of the claim, and if the judge has authority to make such order the action of the judge, in the absence of fraud, is conclusive and stands in the same position as any other judicial judgment or order. (Woody v. Peairs, supra; White v. Mathews, supra.)\\nWe are satisfied that the order which is the subject of dispute in this action was in the nature of a judicial order, and that it cannot be attacked in the manner in which plaintiff here seeks to attack it, unless some defect appears on its face which would show some character of invalidity. It is, therefore, necessary to carefully examine the language of section 928 to ascertain whether any such invalidity appears.\\nThat portion of section 928 of the Penal Code with which we are here specially concerned reads as follows:\\n“It shall be the duty of the Grand Jury annually to make a \"careful and complete examination of the books, records and accounts of all the officers of the county, and of every city board of education within the county, and especially those pertaining to the revenue, and report as to the facts they have found, with such recommendations as they, may deem proper and fit; and if, in their judgment, the services of an expert are necessary, they shall have power to employ one, at an agreed compensation, to be first approved by the court; and if, in their judgment, the services of assistants to such expert are required, they shall have power to employ such, at a compensation to be agreed upon and approved by the court.\\n“It shall be the duty of every grand jury first impaneled in even numbered years to investigate and report upon the needs for increase or decrease in salaries of the county supervisors, the district attorney and the auditor, and it shall cause a copy of such report to be transmitted to each member of the Legislature representing the county in which it has been impaneled before the commencement of the regular *Supp. 893session of the Legislature in odd numbered years. It shall also be the duty of every grand jury to investigate and report upon the needs of all county officers in its county, including the abolition or creation of offices and the equipment for, or the method or system of performing the duties of, the several offices, and it shall cause a copy of such report to be transmitted to each member of the board of supervisors in its county.” (Emphasis added.)\\nSection 928 of the Penal Code is cast into five (5) paragraphs and it will be seen that the first paragraph relates solely to the examination of books, records and accounts. It will be further noted that this first paragraph is all in one sentence, and that the portion relating to the employment of an expert is a part of that sentence. By the doctrine of ejusdem generis, the portion providing power to employ an expert indubitably relates back to and receives its identifying generia from the subject with which the sentence is started.\\nIt will be further noted that the thought content of paragraph two relates to the needs of county officers, including their equipment. This paragraph is complete in itself and contains no reference of any. kind to the employment of an expert.\\nAn examination of the legislative history of grand juries in California compels a conclusion that the Legislature has regularly followed a practice of defining and delimiting the powers of the grand jury in relation to employment of others. (Allen v. Payne, 1 Cal.2d 607 at 608 [36 P.2d 614]; Woody v. Peairs, supra.)\\nWe have examined the statutes of California carefully, and we have not found anything which we consider authority for the employment by the grand jury of an expert to examine and investigate the equipment needs of county officers.\\nIn Allen v. Payne, 1 Cal.2d 607, 608 [36 P.2d 614] the court in holding that grand juries have no inherent or implied powers to contract services in connection with their investigation held “This conclusion is reinforced by an examination of the legislative history of the grand jury in this state, in the light of established rules of statutory construction. That examination reveals a practice of defining and delimiting its powers in relation to employment, by express statutory grant. ... It seems clear . . . that the legislature has considered the employment of persons by grand jury a matter to be governed by statute.”\\nA reading of section 928 of the Penal Code as here*Supp. 894inabove set out fails to show any authority whatever, for the grand jury to employ experts to examine and investigate “the equipment needs of certain offices of the County of Fresno. ’ ’\\nWhatever power the judge had to make the order in the case before us derives from said section 928. The power of the judge to make the order depended on the power of the grand jury to incur the expenses covered by it.\\nSo far as the order authorizing an increase in the amount in excess of $10,000 was for services authorized by section 928 it is not subject to collateral attack, but as to the item of $749.91 for the examination and investigation of the equipment needs of certain offices of the County of Fresno it is void on its face as having been made without jurisdiction for the simple reason that there was no authority in section 928 for the grand jury to contract for these services.\\nThe judgment appealed from is reversed and the cause remanded to the trial court for proceedings in accordance with the views expressed herein.\\n\\nÃ\\x83Â¡\\n\\nShepard, P. J., and Kellas, J., concurred.\\n'"
