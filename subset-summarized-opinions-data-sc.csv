The court disagrees with the district court's interpretation of the terms of the contract; it finds that the City is not selling or allowing any private utility to do business with the City. However, the government contends that the prohibition on sale and distribution does not violate the Constitution's provision prohibiting ""any private person, corporations, or association"" from entering into an agreement to sell or distribute power. It also asserts that there are no restrictions on the ability of public officials to use the power for their own purposes. This argument continues in the House when Senator Mc-Camper attempts to amend the bill to include more provisions regarding the generation, sales, and distribution of power. But the Senate passes the bill without even considering the provisions concerning the purchase and sale of power by private companies.",1940-05-20,2.0

The New York, Connecticut, and Hartford Railroad were all under reorganized under  7 of the Bankrash Act 1, which provides for the separation of property and debt after a certain period of time has passed. The Old Colonies had been operating under a different lease than the New Haven/Old Colony since 1899. Because the Newhaven trustees refused to continue operation as part of the old colony, it was assumed that the lessor would be obligated to pay back the loan. However, in 1939, an order was issued declaring a ""first lien"" on the Boston-Providence road. This is due to the fact that the Massachusetts district court does not have jurisdiction over the claims of those who are responsible for running the road. If the state court determines that there is a sufficient amount of money to pay off the debtor, then the owner of the road will be able to recover the balance without having to go through another bankruptcy court.",1940-04-29,1.0

He argues that it was necessary and proper to raise prices in order to maintain stability in the domestic market.

However, the purchasing programs were not entirely successful because they did not involve an agreement to sell at a uniformly high price.",1940-06-03,2.0
15,9419106,103352,040dissent,"In this case, Justice Roberts dissents from the court's decision that the conspiracy to raise prices in the Midwest is not illegal. The only allegation against the conspirators is that the price of gas at the spot market affects the retail price of the product sold by jobbers in the Western district of Wisconsin. Paragraph 17, the only definition of the charged conspiracy, describes the conspiracy as ""artificially raised and fixing the Tank Car Prices of Gas in the mentioned spot markets."" It further alleges that they have artificially increased and fixed these spot market car prices for the purposes of artificially increasing and fixing general levels of retail prices within the Midwestern region. This includes buying large quantities of fuel from independent refinerys in order to increase the overall level of sales in the area; it also charges that each defendant has arbitrarily exactlyed from jobs within the district large amounts of money. Although the accused major oil companies did not enter into an agreement to sell jobbebers or retailers in the West District of Wisconsin, evidence does not support any such agreement. However, the government concedes that there was some agreement among the defendants regarding the price atwhich gasoline should be purchased. At trial, however, the jury found those who committed the conspiracy had the power and agreed to fix prices. They were convicted on the grounds that their actions had in no degree contributed to raising prices. The court instructed the jury to find that the combination existed and agreeed to make prices go up. The jury found that the combined company had the ability to raise the average price of domestically produced gasoline. If the purchase of distressed gasoline caused prices to rise, then the jury must conclude that the purchases were reasonable and beneficial but not injuriously to the public interests.

However, the court disagrees with the argument that the vessel is bound by its terms without any prohibition against creating a maritime loan.

The court also dismisses two intervening rights lawsuits, one claiming that the manufacturer acquired these rights while the other alleged infringement by an enlarged claim. The district court correctly concludes that there was no evidence of knowledge of or use of the patent before the invention was invented. The case furthermore discusses the provisions under the Patent Act for reissuances. The provision states that any person who has been granted a new patent must surrender it and amend the original specification or claim within two years. This means that if the original patent is not valid, then the owner can renew the patent without incurring any additional costs. In this case, however, the inventor cannot have more than two years of public enjoyment of his invention before the time of the ensuing action. Therefore, the only relief available from the courts is to grant revokement when the original claims are too narrow. However, even if they were originally issued with broad claims, the fact that the claimed machines did not come within the patent does not matter.",1940-05-20,1.0

On their appeal to the state Supreme Court, they claimed that the law was offensive to due process because it denied them free speech and prevented their freedom of religion. They asserted that the constitution did not violate the due process Clause of the Four fourteenth Amendment. However, the court found that the statute was constitutional as an attempt by the state to protect the people against fraud and impregnating funds for what Purported To be Religious, Charitable, or Philanthropic Causes. It was the solicitations that brought the plaintiffs into the sweep ofthe Act and not other activities in spreading literature. The court found no evidence that Cantwell was personally offensive with those whom he asked him to interview. The case furthermore relied on the First Amendment declaring that Congress shall never make any law respecting establishment of religion nor prohibiting its free exercise there. The First Amendment states that Congress may make no laws respecting an established religion or deny the free exercise here. The Second Amendment says that Congress must regulate the time, places, and manner of asking upon its streets and of holding meeting thereon. If the petitioner does not request a certificate from the Secretary of the Public Welfare Council, then the officer will have to decide whether the cause belongs to religion or not. He is allowed to refuse the license if based on facts, judgment, and formation of opinion. The Fifth count charged cantwell with commission of breach of the peaceful.

The court granted the petition but did not grant any further proceedings until May 6, 1935. On September 20, 1935 Borchard submitted a petition to the district court asking that appraiseers be appointed and that his property be put aside. He also requested that the bank release its claim to the orange crop. However, the judge refused to do so because the bank had no lien on the crop. In 1938, the bank tried to leave the property to the petitioners as long as it was clear that the loan would not bring enough money to pay off the debts.

The respondent Federalistically-affiliated labor organization and its officers bring suit against petitioner for trebleing the amount of damages it has caused in connection with an interstate trade strike. The jury finds that the evidence does not show intent on the parts of the responders to restrain ""interstate commerce."" However, the court determines that the entire value of the product shipped from petitioner' factory is less than three percent of the total volume of goods shipped in the country. The Court dismisses the claim that the inter state commerce restrained by the respondent's actions was unsubstantive because the total number of products shipped from Petitioner's plant was less than 3 percent of what the entire industry could produce. Although the facts are uncontroversial, there is sufficient evidence to support the charge that the strike prevents the flow of merchandise into interstate Commerce. The question then arises whether or not the effect of strikes on interstate transportation constitutes a prohibition under the Sherman Antitrust Act. The Supreme Court recognizes that Congress did not intend to prohibit labor unions from operating the law; rather, it was intended to protect competition in the marketplace. Thus, the antitrust provisions do not apply to any contract, combination, or conspiracy in restrainting trade or commerce as long as the activities involved involve interstate business.",1940-05-27,1.0

The Mixed Claclaims Commission was established under an agreement between the two governments, on August 10th 1922, to decide the amount that should be paid byGermany in satisfaction of their financial obligations under treaty. The mixed claims claimants arose due to the destruction of buildings at Black Tom/Kingsland, new Jersey in 1916 and 1918. The United States tried to rehearse these cases but were denied.

  delivered the opinion of the Court.
 

  The question in this case — whether amounts paid by-members of the Merion Cricket Club during the period from July 1, 1931, to June 30, 1935, for golf privileges, constituted payments as “dues or membership fees” subject to the tax imposed by § 501 of the Revenue Act of 1926, 44 Stat. 9, 92, as amended by § 413 of the Revenue Act of 1928, 45 Stat. 791, 864 — does not differ in substance from that decided this day in
  
   White
  
  v.
  
   Winchester Country Club, ante,
  
  p. 32.
 

  With certain exceptions, a member of the Merion Cricket Club could obtain annual golf privileges only by payment of a fee, which varied in amount according to his age and status. The fee was payable in two equal installments, one on the first of January, and the other on
   
   *43
   
  the first of July. A member admitted to golf privileges after the latter date was entitled to remission of one-half of the annual fees, but if one stopped using the golf facilities during the year there was no proportionate refund. If a member elected to play golf he continued to be liable for the succeeding year unless he gave notice of withdrawal before the end of the year. Members who paid the annual golf fees were entitled to use the golf facilities as often as they desired without further charge, and could on occasion obtain golf privileges for their wives and guests.
 

  After a claim for refund of the amounts alleged to have been paid as taxes on the annual golf fees had been duly filed and rejected, the Club on its own behalf and on behalf of its members sued the United States in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania to recover them. The District Court entered a judgment for the United States which was affirmed on appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. 119 F. 2d 578. Certiorari was granted in this case and in

  In this case, as in
  
   White
  
  v.

  we hold that amounts paid were paid as “dues or membership fees,” since they were for rights to the repeated and general use of a common club facility for an appreciable period of time, and were not fixed by each occasion of actual use.

However, the court finds that the charge is too large as it bears little reasonable relationship toward the services rendered. Finally, the Supreme Court decides that there are several important issues that must be addressed in this case. First, we need to determine whether a fee charged by an investment advice firm is excessive.

The Court rightly affirms the careful approach to § 36(b) cases, see 15 U. S. C. §80a-35(b), that courts have applied since (and in certain respects in spite of) Gartenberg v. Merrill Lynch Asset Management, Inc., 694 F. 2d 923, 928-930 *354(CA2 1982). I write separately because I would not shortchange the Court’s effort by describing it as affirmation of the “Gartenberg standard.” Ante, at 344, 353.
The District Court and Court of Appeals in Gartenberg created that standard, which emphasizes fee “fairness” and proportionality, 694 F. 2d, at 929, in a manner that could be read to permit the equivalent of the judicial rate regulation the Gartenberg opinions disclaim, based on the Investment Company Act of 1940’s “tortuous” legislative history and a handful of extrastatutory policy and market considerations, id., at 928; see also id., at 926-927, 929-931; Gartenberg v. Merrill Lynch Asset Management, Inc., 528 F. Supp. 1038, 1046-1050, 1055-1057 (SDNY 1981). Although virtually all subsequent § 36(b) cases cite Gartenberg, most courts have correctly declined its invitation to stray beyond statutory bounds. Instead, they have followed an approach (principally in deciding which cases may proceed past summary judgment) that defers to the informed conclusions of disinterested boards and holds plaintiffs to their heavy burden of proof in the manner the Act, and now the Court’s opinion, requires. See, e. g., ante, at 347 (underscoring that the Act “modifies” the governing fiduciary duty standard “in a significant way: It shifts the burden of proof from the fiduciary to the party claiming breach, 15 U. S. C. § 80a-35(b)(l), to show that the fee is outside the range that arm’s-length bargaining would produce”); ante, at 352 (citing the “degree of deference that is due a board’s decision to approve an adviser’s fees” and admonishing that “the standard for fiduciary breach under § 36(b) does not call for judicial second-guessing of informed board decisions”).
I concur in the Court’s decision to affirm this approach based upon the Investment Company Act’s text and our longstanding fiduciary duty precedents. But I would not say that in doing so we endorse the “Gartenberg standard.” Whatever else might be said about today’s decision, it does not countenance the free-ranging judicial “fairness” review *355of fees that Gartenberg could be read to authorize, see 694 F. 2d, at 929-930, and that virtually all courts deciding § 36(b) cases since Gartenberg (including the Court of Appeals in this case) have wisely eschewed in the post-Gartenberg precedents we approve.

It is decided that Smith meets all three measures because he complains of the dearch of women in Kent County Missouri's jury pool but only 14.5% are summoned as prospective jurorses.

The text of the Sixth Amendment guarantees the right to a trial by “an impartial jury.” Historically, juries did not include a sampling of persons from all levels of society or even from both sexes. See, e. g., Alschuler & Deiss, A Brief History of the Criminal Jury in the United States, 61 U. Chi. L. Rev. 867, 877 (1994) (In 1791, “[e]very state limited jury service to men; every state except Vermont restricted jury service to property owners or taxpayers; three states permitted only whites to serve; and one state, Maryland, disqualified atheists”); Taylor v. Louisiana, 419 U. S. 522, 533, n. 13 (1975) (“In this country women were disqualified by state law to sit as jurors until the end of the 19th century”). The Court has nonetheless concluded that the Sixth Amendment guarantees a defendant the right to a jury that represents “a fair cross section” of the community. Ante, at 319 (citing Taylor, supra).
In my view, that conclusion rests less on the Sixth Amendment than on an “amalgamation of the Due Process Clause and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment,” Duren v. Missouri, 439 U. S. 357, 372 (1979) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting), and seems difficult to square with the Sixth Amendment's text and history. Accordingly, in an appropriate case I would be willing to reconsider our precedents articulating the “fair cross section” requirement. But neither party asks us to do so here, and the only question before us is whether the state court’s disposition was contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, our precedents. See ante, at 320, 325-327; 28 U. S. C. § 2254(d). I concur in the Court’s answer to that question.

concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.
I join Parts I — III and V-VI of the Court’s opinion. As for Part IV, I agree that the stray snippets of legislative history respondent, the Solicitor General, and the dissent have collected prove nothing at all about Congress’s purpose in enacting 31 U. S. C. § 3730(e)(4)(A). Ante, at 295-299. But I do not share the Court’s premise that if a “‘legislative purpose’ ” were “ ‘evident’ ” from such history it would make any difference. Ante, at 298 (quoting United States v. Bornstein, 423 U. S. 303, 310 (1976)). The Constitution gives legal effect to the “Laws” Congress enacts, Art. VI, cl. 2, not the objectives its Members aimed to achieve in voting for them. See Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc., 523 U. S. 75, 79-80 (1998). If § 3730(e)(4)(A)’s text includes state and local administrative reports and audits, as the Court correctly concludes it does, then it is utterly irrelevant whether the Members of Congress intended otherwise. Anyway, it is utterly impossible to discern what the Members of Congress intended except to the extent that intent is manifested in the only remnant of “history” that bears the unanimous endorsement of the majority in each House: the text of the enrolled bill that became law.

The Court disagrees with the majority's interpretation of the definition of ""administrative"" in the Federal Claims Act. Although the court does not explicitly say that it refers to federal or state government sources, the Court nonetheless concludes that there is no reason for Congress to include both types of sources in the statute. First, Congress did not use the knowledge bar as a source of information prior to the passage of the FCA. Second, the bill contained provisions encouraging private parties to bring charges against the government even if they were aware of fraud in the government's possession. Third, however, the legislation contains no mention of any intention to bar suits made by state or local authorities.

However, if the facts supporting the killings prove sufficient to justify a life imprisonment sentence, then the jury must find beyond eminently that the aggrevating circumstance outweighing the mitigaating circumstances.

The Court concludes that these two errors do not prejudice Frank because they did not prejudice him. However, the court also contends that the instructions were improper because they preclude the individual juror from giving evidence against a lesser offense. It furthermore defends the false choice of death or life sentence presented by the Alabama capital punishment system. Although Beck deals with guilt- phase instructions, the limitations of the Alabama penalty system are not so limited as to allow for an all or nothing choice between death or innocence.

This means that the jury will have no time to consider the second option before it decides whether the state has met its burden of proof beyond a certain doubt that the crime is committed.

He recounts how Joseph rented a car and drove into a music shop where he burglarized it. When the police stopped the escape car, they arrested Shaw and David Berstein. On July 25th, 1982, ten years after the incident, Scott and David attacked Kindler outside his apartment; he beat Bernstein 20 times with an electrical prod. At about 2 a.

Justice Alito,
concurring.
I join the Court’s per curiam opinion but emphasize my understanding that the opinion in no way suggests that the American Bar Association’s Guidelines for the Appointment and Performance of Defense Counsel in Death Penalty Cases (rev. ed. 2003) (2003 Guidelines or ABA Guidelines) have spe*14cial relevance in determining whether an attorney’s performance meets the standard required by the Sixth Amendment. The ABA is a venerable organization with a history of service to the bar, but it is, after all, a private group with limited membership. The views of the association’s members, not to mention the views of the members of the advisory committee that formulated the 2003 Guidelines, do not necessarily reflect the views of the American bar as a whole. It is the responsibility of the courts to determine the nature of the work that a defense attorney must do in a capital case in order to meet the obligations imposed by the Constitution, and I see no reason why the ABA Guidelines should be given a privileged position in making that determination.

The only reason for the reduction was to make certain that Congress did not limit the class of people who could claim the tax. If grants were within the law, it was simply because they were granted by virtue of their own rights. However, if there were other classes of people entitled to the tax, such as heirs or deviseers, then the laws would not have been so restrictive. For example, in 1932, Congress extended the existing tax burden to one hundred and fifty acres of each person's holding but also extended more explicitly to cover the entire land in the possession of ""any full blood American heir or invention.""

He claims that he was injured while leaving the ship on land leave but when he returned to the ship in order to get medical treatment, he falls into an opening ditch and is struck by a vehicle. The court dismisses the complaint and the Second Court appeals it. Both courts agree that the seamaner is liable as long as he does not leave the ship or go ashore for any reason. They believe that the injury occurs during the period covered by the crew's articles; however, they do not know whether the injury resulted from fault or misconduct. It is clear that the claimants have different meanings of the term ""in the service"" of the ship: some claimants say that recovery is only conditioned upon showing the injury received while the sailors were at work or performing some erranand for the employers; others claim that the injuries are caused by causes beyond the control of the captain. The parties argue that both cases relate to the question of whether the vessel owner is obligated to provide maintenance and cure because there is no evidence that the cause of the injury occurred while the seaman was working or doing something connected with the ship's business. However, the argument is that the duty extends beyond those activities which the seaman performs. This paper discusses the concept of shore leave, specifically the fact that men cannot live aboard ships without substantial impoverishment until they return to their normal places of activity. If the voyage creates more difficulties for the seamen, then the merchant must take them to foreign ports where they may suffer illness or disease. Although the terms of the contract govern these situations, the principles Governing shipboard injuries affect the facts presented here.

The complaint concerns whether the commission erred when it refused to set ""threeaside"" rates on cotton filed by five of the appellee railways. The question here is whether the commissioner acted improperly in not setting threeaside rates as unfairly discriminatory against shippers under section 2 of the act. The plaintiff pleads with the court to dismiss the charges because the loading charge was charged at the shipmaker's expense and would create an unduly preference between the merchants and the shipper. The court finds that the proposed reduction in the rate is just and reasonably reasonable and does not violate the Act. The only issue the court addresses is whether or not the reduced rate constitutes an unequivocal difference in the price of transportation services. It has been established that differences in rates can justify a relative lower line haul charge over one lines than another; therefore, the decision whether there is a significant difference in costs must be decided by the carriers involved. In this case, however, the carrier performing the loading service cannot be accused of being preferential since the cost of carrying the load is absorbed directly by the carrier. Therefore, the docker may not be harmed by the higher rate paid by the loaded carriage.

The court disagrees with this interpretation and dismisses the argument made by the Board of Trade in Wight: It does not apply when the lines are not overthe same line; for the same length and to the exact same destination. In other words, there may be cases where carriers charge different prices for different accessorial services. For example, if a carriage is traveling south and southeast, then the carriage charges the first shippers because they are performing a similar service under substantially similar conditions. If the carriage costs more than the rate charged by the carrier, however, the discrimination is unjust.

A doctor diagnoses Peter as ""Moron,"" low grade, observation, dementia-praecoix, simple type."" He also diagnoses petitioner as having other illnesses or conditions which may be undetermined. Petitioners wife, however, is appointedguardian in February 1932. Two years later, this suit continues after another half-year. Petyer concedes that he now is completely and permanently depressed by reason of illness. At the trial, five witnesses testify: O'Neill; Wells; Tanikawa; Albert K. Matthews; and Wilder. They all testify that Petter had changed condition over the course of several years. One witness tells Petant that Galloways did not know how many times he saw him at any time between 1918 and 1921. Another witness says that when he came to Philadelphia, he looked to him like he didn't have enough information. When he returned to Philadelphia again, though, she told him that there was such great contrast in the person that they couldn't guess where he went. Finally, one soldier named Joseph Galloaway testifies that despite his physical appearance, petitioner could not remember anything about his military service before 1920. This testimony does not prove complete indictment against petitioner but only confirms what he already knows. Both men testify regarding their experiences in France and England. On September 21, 1920, Dr. Rivers testifies concerning petitioner while he served in the Navy.

Me. Justice Jackson:
Since I think this tax was not one on the corporation (see dissent in International Harvester Co. v. Wisconsin Department of Taxation, ante, p. 445) I see no basis for the corporation to claim a deduction under § 23 (c) of the Revenue Act of 1934. The tax was on the stockholder, and it was paid by the corporation. The Company would be entitled to deductions under § 23 (d) if it were not reimbursed. The credit given to the corporation against a declared dividend is in my opinion a “reimbursement” of the corporation for payment of the tax if the Wisconsin Taxing Act is valid.

However, since the number of shifts per week often caused an employee to perform more than the required amount of work, these wages were insufficient to cover the requirements of the Act.

Justice Breyer,

As respondents point out, the Court’s interpretation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act may create a dilemma for lawyers who regularly engage in debt collection, including through litigation. See Brief for Respondents 44-48; Heintz v. Jenkins, 514 U. S. 291 (1995). Can those lawyers act in the best interests of their clients if they face personal liability when they rely on good-faith interpretations of the Act that are later rejected by a court? Or will that threat of personal liability lead them to do less than their best for those clients?
As the majority points out, however, the statute offers a way out of — though not a panacea for — this dilemma. Ante, at 588,599. Faced with legal uncertainty, a lawyer can turn to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC or Commission) for an advisory opinion. 16 CFR §§ 1.1 to 1.4 (2009). And once he receives that opinion and acts upon it the dilemma disappears: If he fails to follow the opinion, he has not acted in good faith and can fairly be held liable. If he follows the opinion, the statute frees him from any such liability. 15 U. S. C. § 1692k(e) (debt collectors immune from liability for “any act done or omitted in ... conformity with any advisory opinion of the Commission”). See also R. Hobbs et al., National Consumer Law Center, Fair Debt Collection §§6.12.2, 7.3 (6th ed. 2008).
*606The FTC, of course, may refuse to issue such an opinion. See, e. g., 16 CFR § 1.1 (providing that the Commission will issue advisory opinions “where practicable” and only when “[t]he matter involves a substantial or novel question of fact or law and there is no clear Commission or court precedent” or “is of significant public interest”). Apparently, within the past decade, the FTC has received only seven requests and issued four opinions. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 27-28; see also FTC, Commission FDCPA Advisory Opinions, online at http://www.ftc.gov/os/statutes/fdcpajump.shtm (as visited Apr. 19, 2010, and available in Clerk of Court’s case file). Yet, should the dilemma I have described above prove serious, I would expect the FTC to receive more requests and to respond to them, thereby reducing the scope of the problem to the point where other available tools, e. g., damages caps and vicarious liability, will prove adequate. See ante, at 597-601. On this understanding, I agree with the Court and join its opinion.

The court, however, does not apply the standards set forth by Justice Alito in prior cases. Instead, it reverses the decision and orders further proceedings. A group of children in Georgia who are members of the foster care system ask for more than 14 million dollars in attorney fees. They request that the amount be increased by seventy percent rather than the original amount requested. The district court awards $4 million to respondents but reduces the amount by 15 percent. After considering the quality of counsel's performance, the court grants an additional $4.6 million fee. However, the Elevenh Court disagrees with the District Court's decision and concludes that the quality must be accounted for in determining hourly hours or setting reasonable hourly prices. Finally, Judge Carnes dismisses the argument that the court should not make larger reductions in the time spent on the case because such delays are routine features of civil rights cases brought under section 1988. Although the law does not explicitly define what constitutes ""reasonable"" fees, courts have used this method since the early days of the legal system. It uses the rate determined by the market price to calculate the cost of services provided by an attorney. In certain circumstances, superior performance may justify an enhanced fee. For example, if an attorney has extraordinary outlays due to unexpected delays in payment of his or her fees, then the court may grant an enhancement. If the attorney cannot afford to hire expensive counsel at the expense of delay, then there may be an alternative to using the lode star figure.",2010-04-21,1.0

If one were to ask an attorney or a judge to name the significant cases of his or her career, it would be unsurprising to find the list includes a case then being argued or just decided. When immersed in a case, lawyers and judges find within it a fascination, an intricacy, an importance that transcends what the detached observer sees. So the pending or just completed case will often seem extraordinary to its participants. That is the dynamic of the adversary system, the system that so well serves the law.
It is proper for the Court today to reject the proposition that all enhancements are barred; still, it must be understood that extraordinary cases are presented only in the rarest circumstances.

Justice Thomas,

Nearly 30 years ago, a group of attorneys sought a fee award under 42 U. S. C. § 1988 after “achiev[ing] only limited success” litigating their clients’ constitutional claims. Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U. S. 424, 431 (1983). This Court’s opinion resolving their claim for fees observed that “in some cases of exceptional success an enhanced award” of attorney’s fees under § 1988 “may be justified.” Id., at 435 (emphasis added). That observation plainly was dictum, but one year later this Court relied on it to reject the “argument that an ‘upward adjustment’ ” to the lodestar calculation “is never permissible.” Blum v. Stenson, 465 U. S. 886, 897 (1984). Yet “we have never sustained an enhancement of a *561a lodestar amount for performance,” ante, at 552, and our jurisprudence since Blum has charted “a decisional arc that bends decidedly against enhancements,” 532 F. 3d 1209, 1221 (CA11 2008) (Carnes, J.). See also ante, at 552-553.
Today the Court holds, consistent with Hensley and Blum, that a lodestar fee award under § 1988 may be enhanced for attorney performance in a “few” circumstances that “are indeed ‘rare’ and ‘exceptional.’” Ante, at 554. But careful readers will observe the precise limitations that the Court imposes on the availability of such enhancements. See ante, at 554-557; see also ante, at 560 (Kennedy, J., concurring) (“[I]t must be understood that extraordinary cases are presented only in the rarest circumstances”). These limitations preserve our prior cases and advance our attorney’s fees jurisprudence further along the decisional arc that Judge Carnes described. I agree with the Court’s approach and its conclusion because, as the Court emphasizes, see ante, at 553, the lodestar calculation will in virtually every case already reflect all indicia of attorney performance relevant to a fee award.

The Second Court vacated the method because it did not take into account the time value or the actual amount of money that had been distributed to the retirees. However, the court adopted another approach in which the present value was reduced only by how much the past years' wages had been divided. This decision is supported by the opinion of Firestone Tire and Rubber Co., where the standard for deferential review remains appropriate under a situation with a conflict between the trustee and the beneficiary. It is unclear whether the court will strip the trustee of discretion when there are reasons to believe that the trustee does not exercise such discretion fairly.

The third mistake occurs when the court decides that the district court must use ""equitably principles"" to determine the appropriate standard for interpreting the plan. The majority believes that the court should not defer to any trustee's discretionary decisions because it would violate ERISA's Notice provisions.

The First Amendment prohibits states from passing bills of attainteder or ex post factO Law; the Second Amendment prohibiting states from depriving citizens of life, Liberty, or property without due processof law; and the Fifth Amendment prohibitting states from punishing criminals by using a ""petty jury."" These terms are not limited to the specific provisions of Article I, Section 10 of the constitution as they relate to criminal justice. It restricts the liberty of the states generally so that states can pass bills of Attainsder or Ex Post facto Law. States could not ""abridge the privities or immuniities of citizens of United States,"" or ""deprive anyone of life freedom, liberty, nor property, without proper process of law."" Such clauses do not limit the powers of the federal government under Article 1, Section 10, but rather allow them to protect the rights of English speaking people. They are broad, generalized clauses with no particular meaning. When the court first came before the Court, it was suggested that the privileges/immunities of citizen of the U.S. should not be abroadd by any state because the provision of the bill of rights had never been granted countenance. After all, the Fourth Amendment did not imprison the states into the limited experiences of the eighty-first century. Instead, it meant to remove from the states the right to behave in ways that offend a decent regard for the dignity Of Man, and abideless of his Freedom. Thus, the Due Proceetion Clause does not extend the power of the courts to enforce their own principles of justice.

This provision limits the time for the court as to whether or not the estate can be revived. It also limits the amount of time that the court must allow a party to act.

The terms of the lease agreement were that the US would pay the rate charged on these items but that the American would not be able to move them over landgrant lines. This was an important decision because it allowed the United states to recover the amount due on these loans at a lower rate than the commercial rate. However, the courts disagreed with the judgment of the district courts and the court of appeals. These cases deal with petitions for certioraryari in which the question is whether or not the fertilizer is ""military nor naval property"" of the United U.S. moving for either military or naval or not for civil uses. The Congress had passed the Lend Lease Act six months before the passage of the bill; however, this act did not conform to the requirements of the Constitution. Therefore, Congress wrote the Transportation Act differently than the lend-lease Act. Thus, Congress wanted to ensure that the federal government could meet the needs of national defense without having to borrow money from foreign powers.

Petitioners transported five types of material: copper cable, lumber for construction ofmunitions plants, bowling alleies for Dutch Harbor, liquid paving pavement, and ammunition. The question remaining whether within the definition ""military"" or naval property is what it means is whether it is moved for military use or not.

However, the Court has power to enter such orders as punishment for contempt. It does not have the power to abide through all the procedurally safeguards surrounding trials for crime; instead, the court has the authority to coercce obedience to orderly appeals.

It is Congress's decision that no court shall have jurisdiction over such cases; it was in this setting that federal equity power flourished and thus led to the passage of the law. The case involves a labor contract between the coal miner and the private coal operator. Because the government took over the mines as a means to break the union dispute, there is no way for the government to change the terms of the contract. However, since Congress has explicitly stated that strikes or labor disturbances are to be resolved by some other means than federal courts, the case cannot be changed. If the government were to use its ""sezure power"" to repudiation the act, then Congress could easily use seizure powers against the workers under wartime or emergency powers. This would make the case even more dangerous because it would allow the Government to seize private property at the risk of breaking a public strike.

356,9419948,104385,040dissent,"In this paper, the Court argues that Congress's refusal to grant relief to labor unions during the war is not in line with the Constitution's provisions for such relief. The War Dispute Act of 1943 does not include any injuncative or other reasonable relief; rather, it exempts workers from having to resort to ""injunctive and other equitable relief"" because they are subject to government control. It also does not allow Congress to use its power to enforce the terms of the contract. However, the House refused to authorize relief on the grounds that the employees were subject to ""ultimate governmental operating directions and control."" Thus, Congress did not leave the policy behind at all. Instead, it adopted the War Labor Dispondes Act as a means to deal with labor disputes. This act was intended to address the growing need for more effective measures to counter labor disturbances caused by strikes and lockouts. Although Congress had initially planned to repeal the wage strike law, the court's decision has no bearing on the case. If the order violates the constitution's rights, then the people will be forced to comply with the order. Furthermore, the orders would destroy the ability of federal courts to administer justice. Even if Congress wanted to issue an order without jurisdiction, however, the order would still be invalid. Therefore, the only recourse for contempt is to file a habeas corpsus petition. Because the order cannot be found valid, punishment can be based on the fact that there is no reason for contempering the order itself. Finally, even though the order may have been invalid, it could still be used to punish contempt. Assuming that the order is valid, the penalty must be determined according to the lawful character of the order: ""the order's lawful nature."" For example, if one who violates a warrant issued by the district court fails to pay the fine, the magistrate might find him guilty of criminal condescendancy.

Because the federal courts do not apply the intended opinion of the court, juries will not be able to convict unions or corporations without proof of their involvement in the actual conduct of their agents.

The District court held that American were bound by the Indemonity provision ofthe stevedering contract to makes the United State completely whole. This important question is whether the public vessel law makes the US liable for injuries caused by personal injury. The Court has decided that the Act provides only for property damage; it does not provide relief for personal injuries. However, the Congress did pass several bills in 1920 which provided for lawsuits against the country for damages caused through its vessels. The first bill proposed amending the Suitsin Admiralty act so that there would not be a limitation on the amount of money that could be paid to the owner of a damaged vessel. The second bill, introduced in 1921, called for an amendment to H.R.9535, which would have allowed suits under admiralty solely to owners of ships whose property was damaged by accident or another fault of government vessels. It also removed the words ""by collision"" from the Act, making it more difficult for the United states to recover damages due to accidents by public vessels instead of private vessels. Thus, the House Committee believed that the Constitution intended to limit the remedy to property damage but rejected any claim brought by anyone who suffered a personal injury or other property damage. Therefore, the Senate felt that the legislation limited relief to people suffering personal injuries because no one knew how to respond to such claims. Finally, however, after hearing the testimony of Mr. Overhill, the committee agreed that the provisions of the Act do not apply to persons suffering physical injuries nor to their property.

The court decides that she does not retain her American Citizenship under the terms of either the Citizenship act of 19071 or the Nationality acts of 1940. She was married to Alessad Savorgnaan on December 26, 1940; they were both naturalized citizens at the time but did not have any intention of leaving America. They had their marriage passports stamped on December 26 and traveled to Italy for six months before returning to the States.

This case concerns whether a state can enforce the contract against petitioner even though it would have to do with nullifying what the federal law required of such a request. Petyer1s station, WGST, was granted a gift in 1923 by the Georgia Society of Technology as a ""gift."" However, when petitioner applies for a renewed license, the Federal Broadcasting Council finds that petitioner had not exercised any authority over the station and therefore did not have sufficient authority to manage the station. It also found that Southern Broadcast Company had purchased equipment without consulting petitioner since 1930. The commission refused the renewal application on May 8, 1943, but allowed petitioner to make another application for renewing its license. On May 9, 1943, however, petitioner enters into a stock purchase contract with the company. In order to avoid the commission's objections to Southern's operation of G. S. Station, petitioners entered into an agreement wherein they agreed to pay monthly payments equal to 15 percent of the net bills 3 of the stations until January 6, 1949. Since this contract was so expensive, the board decided to sell the station to petitioner instead. After the expiration of the original contract, no further payments were made under the terms of the new contract. Finally, the court decides that the disaffirmment of the previous contract is uncontradicted because the price of the stock buy contract was too high. The Court appeals to the Supreme Court to grant relief on the basis that the Constitution does not allow states to recover money from a party accused of fraud.",1950-02-06,1.0

432,9420445,104771,040dissent,"
Mr. Justice Jackson,
dissenting.
The only issue surviving in this case is whether the charge gave the jury a sufficiently clear and correct knowledge of the law to be applied.
The Court of Appeals thought the charge as a whole “very probably gave the jury the impression” that it need only find that two cars failed to couple on impact to establish a violation of the Safety Appliance Act. This, as the Court recognizes, is not the law. Before a failure to couple establishes a defective coupler, it must be found that it was properly set so it could couple. If it was not adjusted as such automatic couplers must be, of course the failure is not that of the device.
*102The instructions contained language quoted by this Court that would suggest this rule. Other language was used, however, which might well cancel the effect of that quoted. Judge Collet, for the Court of Appeals, said, “We are unable to escape the conclusion that the instruction was not sufficiently clear and definite in that respect.” 174 F. 2d at 491.
If the charge seemed so foggy to a Court of Appeals, generally familiar with what the trial judge was driving at, I do not see how this Court can be so confident that it did not mislead a jury of laymen. That confidence is all upon which we reverse the judgment. We cannot know any more about its effect than did the Court of Appeals; and that court happened to have been composed of judges, two of whom have had the experience of presiding over jury trials in District Court, which gives them a better informed mind on the subject than we have. I should be inclined to agree with them that the charge leaves the subject in so much confusion that I do not know just what the instruction did amount to. The most that can happen under the decision now being reversed is to resubmit the case to a jury that probably would be more carefully and clearly instructed.
In any event, I do not think this is the kind of issue that meets the qualifications we have ourselves laid down for grant of certiorari. Supreme Court Rule 38 (5). No question of law is, or could be, settled unless we could devise some measure of incoherence so that lower courts would know how much we will think is too much. Short of that, we only substitute our own impression for that of the Court of Appeals as to the probable psychological effect of the instruction in this individual case. All that was written in favor of dismissing a writ as improvidently granted in Carter v. Atlanta & St. A. B. R. Co., 338 U. S. 430, 437, and Wilkerson v. McCarthy, 336 U. S. 53, 65-77, seems especially applicable here. I would dismiss this writ as improvidently granted.

  In this cause, reversing the decree of the United States District Court, we held [286 U. S. 461] that the appellee had failed to exhaust the administrative remedy afforded by the Montana statute, and that the federal court was therefore without jurisdiction as a court of equity to enjoin enforcement of the State Auditor’s order.
 

  The appellee has presented a petition for rehearing which concedes the correctness of our ruling that the statute gives a remedy partly administrative in character, by suit in the state district court, but contends that by this grant the act violates Article IV, § 1, of the Montana Constitution, which is:
 

  “ The powers of the government of' this State are divided into three distinct departments: The Legislative,
   
   *347
   
  Executive, and Judicial, and no person or collection of persons charged with the exercise of powers properly belonging to one of these departments shall exercise any powers properly belonging to either of the others, except as in this constitution expressly directed or permitted.”
 

  As this question was not briefed or argued when the ease was first heard we granted a reargument; and the cause has again been presented on this point.
 

  The statute plainly affords a remedy which, though in certain respects judicial, is in others administrative. The courts of Montana have not passed upon its constitutionality as affected by the quoted section of the fundamental law of the State. Such expressions of the Supreme Court as have been brought to our attention indicate that Article IV, § 1, does not forbid the conference on the state district courts of administrative powers in connection with and ancillary to their judicial functions.

He brought claims against CSX for failing to install warning devices at that crossing and for running the train at excessive speed. Both claims were preempted by the Federal Railroad safety Act of 1970, which prohibits state governments from adopting or continuing in force any laws, rule, regulations, order or standard pertaining to railroad safety. The federal law on which Petitioner seeks to claim negligence is FRSA, which states are permitted to adopt or continue-in force any law ""rule, regulation, ordering, or standard"" relating to railway safety until such times as the Secretary had adopted a rules, regulation orders, or standards covering the subject matters of such State need. In addition, Congress has passed a highway safety act, which makes federal money available to the states to improve grades across the country. After petitioner's answer is denied, the court decides that the only issue before the court is whether the secretary has issued regulations regarding grade crossing safety under the authority granted to the Secretary by the Constitution. It is not clear whether the statute covers the subject matter with which petitioner asserts fault but does not explicitly cover the subject material. However, the requirements set out in the FhWA's manual on uniform traffic control devices for streets and highways do not apply to petitioner; instead, the provisions require the States to comply with the manual.

Because the court believes that ""the result desirable from finality and fairness,"" it is not necessary to directly review a judgment of conviction in order to determine whether or not an individual should be imprisoned. The Court also recognizes that there are many concerns regarding collateral attacks against the Constitution as well as federalism; however, the Supreme Court has consistently held that federal courts have no obligation to adjudicate certain claims because they relate to ""prudential concern"" such as Equity and Federalism. Thus, when Congress gave the national courts authority to issue orders ordering release of state prisons, these courts were able to withhold relief until after states had terminated their criminal trials. However, since the constitutional provisions prohibiting any kind of claim from being litigated, the Court continues to hold that all kinds of claims can be barred from having been adjudicated. Although the Court has previously refused to bar specific types of claims, including those concerning the exclusionation of confessions obtained by violation of Miranda, the case now confronts the question whether the Fifth Amendment applies to cases where the accused does not make a declaration of innocence. It is important to note that although the Fourth Amendment limits the ability of the police to obtain confessions without warning, the absence of unwarranted but voluntary statements makes it impossible for the police officers to use evidence against the accused at trial.

591,9432789,112848,020lead,"In this case, Justice O'Connor focuses on the question of whether the absence of two alternates during juror deliberations constitutes a ""plain error"" that the court is authorized to correct in criminal cases. The trial was held in the western district of Washington, D. C. on multiple federal crimes for their involvement in an elaborate loans kickback scheme. All parties agreed that fourteen jurors should be selected to listen to the case and that the two alternative jurorses would be identified shortly before deliberation began. On June 26, shortly before finalizing the decision, the Court asked the plaintiffs whether they want the two alternate judges to retire into jury deliberating. Gray's counsel told the District Court that it was difficult to select the two substitutes because there were so many witnesses present. One day after the trial, however, the court asked the other three respondents who wanted the alternates out. They answered that they did not want them out but that they thought it was best to have them all go back so as to avoid having to participate in the proceedings. After the trial ended, the Judge ordered the two remaining alternates to remain until the verdict was returned. Both respondents are convicted on several charges under Federal Rule 241; they appeal to the United State Court of Appellates for reconsideration. The Court finds fault with the district court's refusal to grant individual waivers by the defendants personally. It then found that the presence or participation of the alternate members of the jury violated Federal rule 52-b, which prohibits any person from attending the jury room except when the accused consents to their presence. The court furthermore found that one of the regular jurers was excused due to his request. However, the second alternate left the juryroom at the end of each deliberated session. The Second Amendment states that no procedural principle exists more familiar to the Court than that: A constitutional right may be forfeiteded in criminal matters by failure to make time to assert the right before tribunal having jurisdiction over it. This Constitutional right has been recognized since the original versions of the Criminal Act. The First Amendment provides that a court can correct an error within its discretion only if both the error and the error affect substantial rights.

Justice Kennedy,
concurring.
I join the Court’s opinion and add this brief statement to express my own understanding of the Court’s holding.
When a court notices an error on its own initiatiye under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(b), see Silber v. United States, 370 U. S. 717, 718 (1962) (per curiam), it may be awkward to say that the case is decided by burden of proof concepts, for by definition none of the parties have addressed the issue. But the Court’s opinion is phrased with care to indicate that burden of proof concepts are the normal or usual mode of analysis of error under Rule 52, see ante, at 734-735, and so other rules may apply where the aggrieved party has not raised the issue. In most cases, how*742ever, the party will have raised the alleged error on appeal. In that context, the analysis the Court adopts today is helpful, for it gives operative effect to the difference under Rule 52 between those cases where an objection has been preserved and those where it has not.
That leads me to a final point, which is the independent force of the Rule against permitting alternates in the jury room during deliberations. As the Court is careful to note, this case was submitted on the assumption that it is error to follow this practice, and the Court does not question that premise. Indeed, there are good reasons to suppose that Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 24(c) is the product of a judgment that our jury system should be given a stable and constant structure, one that cannot be varied by a court with or without the consent of the parties. See Reply Brief for United States 9, n. 4. In the course of a lengthy trial, defense counsel, who may have numerous requests for rulings pending before a district court, may acquiesce in a proposal from the bench concerning jury composition so that counsel can concentrate on matters they deem more pressing. In such a climate, the trial court ought not to put counsel in the position of having to object to a suggestion that compromises the Federal Rules.
If there were a case in which a specific objection had been made and overruled, the systemic costs resulting from the Rule 24(c) violation would likely be significant, since it would seem to me most difficult for the Government to show the absence of prejudice, which would be required to avoid reversal of the conviction under Rule 52(a). Rule 24(c) is based on certain premises about group dynamics that make it difficult for us to know how the jury’s deliberations may have been affected. Defendants seeking reversal under Rule 52(b) are also likely to experience these difficulties in proving prejudice. But, as the Court makes clear today, the operation of Rule 52(b) does not permit a party to withhold *743an objection to the presence of alternate jurors during jury deliberations and then to demand automatic reversal.

In this case, petitioner and her co-conspirators are charged with conspiring against the government. On the count 20, she is charged with two objects: 1) impairing efforts of the internal revenue service to ascertain taxation; and 2) impairting the efforts ofthe drug enforcement administration to assess forfeitability assets. However, since testimony from one of their witnesses did not make it clear that they were involved in the conspiracy, Griffin's request for a special interrogation fails. The court grants petitioner's motion but rejects her general verdict because it leaves in doubt whether she committed any of the two items of the conspiracy or whether she was involved in either one. The Court also discusses the Due Process clause of the Constitution and the jury test provision of the Fifth amendment. Petyer contends that the rule of criminal procedures applied by the seventh court is not an invention. It was established law in England prior to the declaration of independence that a General Guilty could be set aside under certain circumstances. This principle applies to cases where there is no one to support the charge. A single count charging a particular offense can be accused of doing all the forbidden things at once. Thus, if a person commits only one thing, then the entire crime will be proven. If a man commits more than one act, however, the charges cannot be doubled. Therefore, the Supreme Court has decided that the due process clause does not apply when a specific charge violates the Constitution's provisions forbidding such conduct. Instead, it applies to situations in which a juror finds a valid basis for convicting someone. These cases include three cases involving violations of the Article III section of the constitution: Stromberg, Williams, and Cramer.

However, it is clear that the term ""relation-back"" refers to misnomers who have no knowledge of criminal acts at the time their property is confiscated.

Instead, we must ask whether she has any rights that require separate forfeiture. If she does have such rights, it is not necessary to inquire about her knowledge or lack of know-how regarding drug offenses. The answer is no; instead, the burden rests on the title and possession of the asset held by the donor. It is only when the holder knows about the illegal act that the transaction is subject to forfeitture. Thus, the dealer did not simply know of the drugs but performed them. He could not keep the property as long as he knew of the crime. Therefore, the only possible interest of an owner would be one superior to the interests of the U.S. This means that a buyer who bought the property for value cannot hold it because there is no buyer with whom to dispute the government's claim. Finally, the Supreme Court disagrees with the majority's interpretation of Chapter 881: ""The statutory Puzzle the plurality found so engaging is made because a false principle, the  premises that the possesser of an asset subjects to forfeiture do not stand in position of the transferredor but must are charged with some innocent knowledge of herown.""",1993-02-24,1.0

The act provides for levy an annual fee on each store owned by the same owner or corporation; however, if there are more than one store located in a particular county, the fee is increased materially. The law also includes a tax equal to $20 per 1,000 of value of stocks carried in eachstore or for sale at such store. In addition, the bill charges a graduated tax of $4.00 per year for each $1,000 worth of stock held in storage. Three chain merchants filed a class bill in the court against the proposed law. The plaintiffs claim that the laws violate various provisions of the Constitution, the due process, and equal protection Clauses of the Fourthteenth Amendment and of the Commerce clause of the federal constitution. They argue that the legislature may not make the distinction between the two methods of conducting businesses the basis of categorical taxation. However, they contend that the difference in taxes cannot be so great as to transcend constitutional powers of Congress. The legislature has declared that the tax must be paid on every storeowner and operator who owns multiple stores. If the new store is located in another county, then the increase in the tax will be higher than the rate already levied on all the existing stores. This argument is rejected because the legislature does not intend to distinguish large corporate chains from small individuals. It is clear that the legislative purpose was to tax everyone involved in opening or maintaining a store. Section 5 of the act states that the entire tax shall be raised only on the amount of stores situated in such counties or municipalities.

However, the case does not concern either class of corporations or foreign corporations. It concerns only businesses. If the state grants the privilege for interstate commerce, it may be granted broadly or restrict its exercise to a few places of business within the state. If an individual refuses to pay the fee, then the state may decide notto grant the privilege again. Finally, if a state determines that sufficient protection against harm can be secured without raising the corporate license fee as compensation for such restriction, then no matter how much the state limits the amount of capital stock, the citizens will still have the right to reject the charge.",1933-03-13,1.0

It is not required that a federal court judge recuse in any proceeding where his impartiality may reasonably be questioned. This case concerns petitioners who were charged with vandalism and willful destruction at Fort Benning military reservation. Before trial, petitioners sought disqualification from the district judge because the judge displayed impatience toward the defense and an animosity towards Bourgeoi's codefendant and their beliefs; they also asserted that the judge had interrupted the opening argument to prevent new facts from being presented. The judge denied the motion, but the Eleventh Court affirmed the charges. Since 1821, there has been no such provision for recusals for bias since 1792. However, under the 1821 constitution, judges are now required to recusle when they have some interest in the lawsuit or have been advised by a party during the proceedings.

827,9432870,112896,040dissent,"The Court rejects Doe's argument that strict or ""heightened scrutiny"" should apply in determining the disparity between treatment and some rational justification. It is clear that there are different kinds of mental illness as well as different degrees of retardation, and it is not possible for the state to treat those with both conditions differently. However, the court does not deny any difference between these two conditions. For example, when an allegation accuses someone of being mentally retardated, the person must prove that he presents a dangerous or danger of danger to others, requires medical treatment, and can reasonably be treated in a state run institution. In addition, the individual must demonstrate that his treatment will benefit him. If the State cannot prove that this condition is one of physical retardation or mental illness, however, then the individual may not be protected from the burden of proof required by the statute. Therefore, the Court concludes that only the harder proof is justified because the lower burden of evidence reduces the risk of error caused by the higher burden; furthermore, the more difficult proof raises the question whether there are other differences in the interests of the people involved in the commitment proceedings. Thus, even if the mentally retardd loses liberty due to civil commitment, they still retain their strong interest in their liberties. This conclusion is supported by studies of how poorly drug treatment is used in treating mentally retardation. Furthermore, the courts suggest that patients subject to such treatment are less invasive on the part of the mentally sick than physically retarded who receive drugs. Finally, the cases do not justify a system in which immediate family members and/or guardians are called witnesses in the committal proceeding. They are also unrelated to the specific provisions of the statute regarding the involvement of third parties.

General application of distinctions of the kind made by the Vermont statute would clearly, though indirectly, threaten the “federal interest in free interstate migration.” Id., at 66.

839,9430074,111463,040dissent,"In this case, the Court argues that the state's use tax does not violate equal protection because it is not intended to discriminate against anyone. The court imagines a hypothetical discrimination and then threatens that the law will violate equality unless the State or the legislature rejects the court's conjectures. The purpose of the vehicle tax is to defray costs for building and maintenance of roads in the state. If someone purchases a new car in another state but registers its in Vermont, they are exempt from the sales tax. If the person returns to the state with his new car, however, he can pay the same amount of taxes as if the out-state buyer had already purchased his car. This allows an out-and-out buyer to buy a car anywhere in the country without being taxed by the state; thus, the buyer has no choice but to pay the full price of the purchase. The credit also helps ensure that people who live in other states do not have to pay their own taxes. However, the courts find that the exception to the use tax applies only to those who move to a different state after purchasing their car. Thus, if a person leaves the state to purchase a motorcar outside the state but lives in the city, there is no difference in treatment among the two states. Therefore, the residents of both states must be treated differently when they leave the state than when they arrive in one state.",1985-06-04,1.0

In this case the Court takes advantage of the “Catch-22” paradox of its own creation, see Wallace, supra, at 109-110 (Rehnquist, J., *421dissenting), whereby aid must be supervised to ensure no entanglement but the supervision itself is held to cause an entanglement. The Court today strikes down nondiscriminatory nonsectarian aid to educationally deprived children from low-income families. The Establishment Clause does not prohibit such sorely needed assistance; we have indeed traveled far afield from the concerns which prompted the adoption of the First Amendment when we rely on gossamer abstractions to invalidate a law which obviously meets an entirely secular need.

931,9424951,108580,040dissent,"In this paper, Justice Douglas argues that the Court's decision in federal baseball club v. national league is a ""derelict"" in the law that Congress should remove. The court had a parochially narrow view of commerce and was not concerned with protecting the rights of baseball players. It would be hard to say whether baseball was just a local exhibit or trade or commerce because it was so dependent on air and television. If Congress were to pass legislation exempting sports from anti-trust regulation, then there would be no need for Congress to do so. However, Meeshall joins him in this argument. He says that congress has refused to grant professional sports an exempt from antitrust laws since they have already granted such an exception. Petitioners claim that the reserve clause violates the antitrust provisions of the Sherman Act. The case concerns petitioner's claim that his contract with the Phillies does not belong to any club owner but to the Major League Baseball Club. Petyer asserts that the system is unfair because it prevents him from being able to play for other major league clubs. The courts disagreed with the arguments made by the Federal Athletic Club and toolson. They held that baseball did not fall within the purveyance of the Antitrust Laws. Thus, we must decide whether to bring baseball into the protection of these laws. Since baseball belongs to all kinds of people, including baseball players, lawyers; doctors; and members of any class of workers, as well as those who are involved in other types of business, the importance of theantitrust laws cannot be reduced.

They testified that they did not make any contribution to the fund because they were not required to do so; however, their testimony was overwhelming. The court found each of the defendants guilty of conspiring to violate section 610. On appeal, the Court denied all of the charges against the union but held that the funds were part of a conspiracy. The President signed into law on April 7, 1972, amending Section 610 by adding an exception to the prohibition on direct contributions made by union members as long as the money is voluntarily volunteered by the members. The parties agreed that a Union could ""establish"" a political institution for the purposeof receiving earmarked political monetarys directly from voluntary contributions of union members -- even if this means that the union itself would not be allowed to use its members' dues to support political purposes. However, Congress had already passed legislation prohibiting such expenditures during federal elections. In addition to these provisions, the government has also proposed an amendment to Chapter 304 which prohibits financial institutions from making payments to political committees or candidates who are running for office. The Senate Committee on Elections supported the Hansen Amendment when it first came into effect. It permitted union officials to set up and administer a separate political fund for political uses. The term ""separates"" refers to the fact that there is nothing between the union and the fund. The only difference between Crane's and Hansen's provisions is that the term ""Segregated"" means apartness beyond the meaning of ""dues,"" fees, or taxes required as conditions of membership in local union or as condition of employment. This interpretation does not change the legal basis for the prosecution.

The jurors find that the payment tothe fund was voluntary although some may have been paid voluntarily by others.

The Court disagrees with the majority's definition of ""political contribution."" It interprets Section 610 as meaning that any union or corporation can make political contributions without being asked to give them directly; rather, it means that the union or corporations can only make political expenditures provided that the funds are voluntary. In other words, the Constitution does not allow unions to make political expenses through their own money. However, the court believes that there is some legislative history that supports its interpretation of section 610. For instance, Congress passed the Federal Election Act of 1971 to restrict and reduce the influence of corporations on elections. This legislation was motivated by two things: first, the necessity to destroy the influence Over elections which corporations engaged through financial contribution; and second, the feel that corporate officials did not have moral rights to use stockholders' funds for political purposes without the approval of the Stockholders. Finally, the Court concludes that the fund must be separate from the union because it has been set up to circumvent provisions of a law such as  646.

This case concerns the question of whether a court can entice state officials or local officials who have not yet completed their work in desegregating a dual-school system. The City of Em-Poria, Virginia, is a political independent city with a long history of enforcing resentegment of blacks and whites within its boundaries. It was established in 1967 as a town under Virginia law; it was primarily part of the surrounding county for basically all purposes,including the purpose of serving public education for citizens residing inthe county. However, when the County Board refused to continue running the school system without Emporia's involvement, she agreed to share in the management of the schools through her par*455"" program. Under this arrangement, Emporio had no formal authority in managing the schools except through its par***455 training.

On September 1, 1969, they file a supplementary complaint asking the State Board to certify emporia as separate school division because it would interfere with the proposed operation of the separate system.

.Mr. Chief Justice Burger,
with whom Mr. Justice Blackmun, Mr. Justice Powell, and Mr. Justice Rehnquist join, concurring in the result.
I agree that the creation of a separate school system in Scotland Neck would tend to undermine desegregation efforts in Halifax County, and I thus join in the result reached by the Court. However, since I dissented from the Court’s decision in Wright v. Council of City of Emporia, ante, p. 471; I feel constrained to set forth briefly the reasons why I distinguish the cases.
First, the operation of a separate school system in Scotland Neck would preclude meaningful desegregation in the .southeastern portion of Halifax County. ' If Scotland Neck were permitted to operate separate schools, more than 2,200 of the nearly 3,000 students in this sector would attend virtually all-Negro schools located just *492outside of the corporate limits of Scotland Neck. The schools located within Scotland Neck would be predominantly white. Further shifts could reasonably be anticipated. In a very real sense, the children residing in this relatively small area would continue to attend “Negro schools” aud “white schools.” The effect of the Withdrawal would thus be dramatically different from the effect which could be anticipated in Emporia.
Second, Scotland Neck’s action cannot be seen as the fulfillment of its destiny as an independent governmental entity. Scotland Neck had been a part of the countywide school system for many years; special legislation had to be pushed through the North Carolina General Assembly to enable Scotland Neck to operate its own school system. The movement toward the creation of a separate school system in Scotland Neck was prompted solely by the likelihood of desegregation in the county, not by any change in the political status of the municipality. Scotland Neck was and is a part of Halifax County. The city of Emporia,. by contrast, is totally independent from Greensville County; Emporia’s only ties to the county are contractual. When Emporia became a city, a status derived pursuant to longstanding statutory procedures, it took on the legal responsibility of providing for the education of its children and was no longer entitled to avail itself of the county school -facilities.
Third, the District Court found, and-it is undispúted, that the Scotland Neck severance was substantially motivated by the desire to create a predominantly white system more acceptable to the white parents of Scotland Neck. In other words, the new system was designed to minimize the number of Negro children attending school with the white children residing in Scotland Neck. No similar finding was made by the District Court in Em-poria, and the record shows that Emporia’s decision was not based on the projected racial composition of the proposed new system.

Given the Court’s holding that § 810 of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA), 94 Stat. 2371, 16 U. S. C. § 3120, does not apply to the Outer Continental Shelf, it is unnecessary to decide whether the Court of Appeals applied the proper standard in determining the *556availability of injunctive relief.* Accordingly, I join only Parts I and III of the Court’s opinion.

Indeed, the Court itself recognizes this when it declines to reach two additional questions that were presented in the petition. See ante, at 534-535, n. 1. This is not a case in which discussion of a nonessential issue is arguably appropriate because the lower court is likely to employ the identical legal analysis on remand. Even if, in light of the decisions in this case and the cross-petition, the Court of Appeals finds that respondents retain aboriginal rights in the Outer Continental Shelf, it would apparently not apply the same injunctive relief standard that it applied with relation to ANILCA. The special injunctive standard applied to the ANILCA claim was based on Circuit precedent providing that, absent unusual circumstances, “[a]n injunction is the appropriate remedy for a substantive procedural violation of an environmental statute.” People of Gambell v. Hodel, 774 F. 2d 1414, 1422 (1985) (emphasis added). See generally Save Our Ecosystems v. Clark, 747 F. 2d 1240, 1250 (CA9 1984).

Mr. Justice Rehnquist,
dissenting.
The New Jersey Legislature has enacted a statute entitled “Assistance to Families of the Working Poor,” which is designed to provide grants to supplement the income of a discrete class of families with children when independent sources of income are inadequate to support the family unit. The program is completely financed by the State, and therefore need not conform to any of the strictures of the Social Security Act. The New Jersey program for assistance to the working poor does not provide financial grants to classes of children as such, as is the case under various federal plans. Instead, it provides grants to classes of families as units. The Court *622holds that because benefits are limited to families “which consist of a household composed of two adults of the opposite sex ceremonially married to each other who have at least one minor child ... of both, the natural child of one and adopted by the other, or a child adopted by both,” the legislative scheme violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
The Court relies on Weber v. Aetna Casualty & Surety Co., 406 U. S. 164 (1972), where a Louisiana statute that denied workmen’s compensation benefits to an illegitimate child was invalidated. But the very language that the Court quotes from Weber shows how different this case is from that. There a disability was visited solely on an illegitimate child. Here the statute distinguishes among types of families. While the classification adopted by the New Jersey Legislature undoubtedly results in denying benefits to “families” consisting of a mother and father not ceremonially married who are living with natural children, whatever denial of benefits the classification makes is imposed equally on the parents as well as the children.
Here the New Jersey Legislature has determined that special financial assistance should be given to family units that meet the statutory definition of “working poor.” It does not seem to me irrational in establishing such a special program to condition the receipt of such grants on the sort of ceremonial marriage that could quite reasonably be found to be an essential ingredient of the family unit that the New Jersey Legislature is trying to protect from dissolution due to the economic vicissitudes of modern life. The Constitution does not require that special financial assistance designed by the legislature to help poor families be extended to “communes” as well.
In the area of economics and social welfare the Equal Protection Clause does not prohibit a State from taking one step at a time in attempting to overcome a social ill, provided only that the classifications made by *623the State are rational. Here the classification is based on a particular type of family unit, one of, if not the, core units of our social system. There being a rational basis for the legislative classification, the constitutionality of the law is governed by Dandridge v. Williams, 397 U. S. 471 (1970), rather than by Weber.
I would affirm the judgment of the District Court.

I agree with Parts I and II of Justice Scalia’s dissenting opinion. Although I do not join Part III, I also would overrule Weber. My understanding of Weber was, and is, that the employer’s plan did not violate Title VII because it was designed to remedy the intentional and systematic exclusion of blacks by the employer and the unions from certain job categories. That is how I understood the phrase “traditionally segregated jobs” that we used in that case. The Court now interprets it to mean nothing more than a manifest imbalance between one identifiable group and another in an employer’s labor force.

This law prohibits employers from discriminating against individuals because of such individuals' race, color religious, sexual or national origin as long as they are designed to break down the old patterns of segregation in the community. In this case, Paul Johnson was employed by the County of San Clara on October 16, 1979 under the county's Equal Employment Opportunity Plan. The plan does not seek to remedy prior ""sex"" discrimination but instead establishes ""a sexually Representative work force,"" which will mirror the composition of all the other jobs in the county. It also does not intend to eliminate the effect of previous sexe discrimination; rather, it wants to mirror the entire population of the county labor force so that women, minorities, and handicapped people do not have to endure the same kinds of oppression.

I join in the Court’s opinion because I agree that due regard for the relation of the States, one to another, in our federal system and for that of the courts of the *91United States to those of the States requires that claims even as serious as those here urged first be raised in the courts of the demanding State. Even so, it is appropriate to emphasize that in this case there is no suggestion in the application for habeas corpus that the prisoner would be without opportunity to resort to the courts of Alabama for protection of his constitutional rights upon his return to Alabama. We cannot assume unlawful action of the prison officials which would prevent the petitioner from invoking the aid of the local courts nor readily open the door to such a claim. Compare Cochran v. Kansas, 316 U. S. 255. Our federal system presupposes confidence that a demanding State will not exploit the action of an asylum State by indulging in outlawed conduct to a returned fugitive from justice.

Since, in my view (as indicated in my dissent in On Lee v. United States, 343 U. S. 747, 762), this wire tapping was a search that violated the Fourth Amendment, the evidence obtained by it should have been excluded. The question whether the Fourth Amendment is applicable to the states (see Wolf v. Colorado, 338 U. S. 25) probably need not be reached, because a Texas statute has excluded evidence obtained in violation of the Federal Constitution. Therefore I would reverse the judgment. It is true that the prior decisions of the Court point to affirmance. But those decisions reflect constructions of the Constitution which I think are erroneous. They impinge severely on the liberty of the individual and give the police the right to intrude into the privacy of any life. The practices they sanction have today acquired a momentum that is so ominous I cannot remain silent and bow to the precedents that sanction them.

I agree with my Brother Stewart that the dispute in the present ease is within the jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board and that that jurisdiction is exclusive of state jurisdiction. The foreign-flag ship involved in the present controversy is Liberian. Hence I add a few observations generated by Noel Mostert’s Super-ship (1974) discussing the problems of the big new oil tankers and their vast pollution of the oceans of the world. He puts Liberian-flag ships in the following perspective:
“Liberia now has the world’s largest merchant marine, followed by Japan and Britain, and her lead is rapidly increasing; flag of convenience fleets have regularly grown at rates more than twice those of world fleets as a whole. Liberia and Panama together now own, on paper, nearly a quarter of world shipping. Tankers dominate these expatriate fleets.
“Thirty-five to 40 percent of the Liberian tonnage is American-owned, and an additional 10 percent of *233it is American-financed, which helps explain where the American merchant fleet, in steady decline since the end of the war, has taken itself. According to law, American-flag ships must be built in the United States and must be three-quarters manned by Americans. American shipbuilding costs used to be double those elsewhere (inflation abroad has helped make them competitive again), and American seamen’s wages are still higher than elsewhere. . . .
“Flag of convenience operators often say that their ships, especially many of those under the Liberian flag, are among the largest, best-equipped, and most modern in the world. This may be true. But ships are only as good as the men who run them, and the record is not impressive. Old ships traditionally have a higher casualty rate than new ones. Liberian losses between 1966 and 1970 not only averaged twice as high as those of the other major maritime nations, but, contrary to the rule, the ships they were losing were on the whole new ones, certainly newer than the ones lost by the other principal merchant marines: the average age of Liberian losses in that four-year period was 8.7 years, while that of the Japanese and Europeans averaged 12 years.
“To a disconcerting degree, oil cargoes have been delivered in recent years by improperly trained and uncertificated officers aboard ships navigating with defective equipment.” Id., at 58-59.
While the Liberian-flag vessel in the present case was not an oil tanker, the quoted passages demonstrate the scope of the public interest of our people in keeping marine traffic in more responsible hands than those which the “flag of convenience” commonly uses. No public issue is today more important, at least to the life of the oceans of the world and the well-being of our own working force. Large national interests ride on today’s decision. Congress, in this type of case, has appropriately *234made the National Labor Relations Board the exclusive arbiter of the present controversy, as my Brother Stewart convincingly demonstrates.

Although the court does not explicitly state what it means by ""the sharp break"" standard, it does acknowledge that there are other cases where the Supreme Court's decisions do not conform to the Constitution's standards. This case illustrates the dangers inherent in addressing prospectsivity where the ""sharp breaks"" test is not met and therefore cannot be applied prospectively. However, the Court also recognizes that prospectivity is not automatically determined through the provision of our Constitution on which its dictate is  base. Thus, instead of suppressing evidence obtained from searches invalidated under the Fourth Amendment, the court now uses the term ""deterrency"" to describe the deterring effect of the rule as opposed to punishment for law enforcement officials who break the rule. Furthermore, the new formulation removes the foundation of the previous exclusionary rules since it relies on special or particular deterrance. Therefore, rather than punishing individual law enforcement official with direct punishment, the searchers could simply stop at random cars within 100 miles away from the United States and search illegal aliens only if no good reason exists to believe that their vehicles contain such illegal immigrants.",1975-06-25,1.0

Although the Court has always believed that an officer should be allowed to arrest without having a warrant prior to making such an arrest, today the Court believes that there are two significant flaws inherent in the current approach: first, the courts believe that a peace officer can arrest without obtaining a warrant; and second, the laws do not support the traditional interpretation of the Fifth Amendment -- that is, they treat crimes as misdemenors or misdemoanors only if they are committed in the public place. Thus, even though the Court considers these cases as being analogous to criminal offenses like robbery, murder, and rape, the fact that many of these crimes are considered felons does not mean that they cannot be arrested immediately. Therefore, although the Court recognizes some tension between the constitutional presumptions favoring warrant requirements and the exception requiring immediate arrests from the most dangerous individuals, it remains unconvinced that the fourth amendment will protect our citizens against unreasonable searches.",1975-10-06,1.0

Mr. Justice Stewart,
concurring.
I could not base affirmance of the judgment upon the ground that the petitioner's motion was technically deficient in failing to recite the talismanic phrase “without probable cause.” Nor do I think the District Court lacked power to issue the requested injunction, either by reason of 28 U. S. C. § 2283 or the rule formulated in Harkrader v. Wadley, 172 U. S. 148, 164. It seems to me that Rea v. United States, 350 U. S. 214, established that District Courts do have such power.*
But I join in affirming the judgment. The petitioner has failed to state a case warranting equitable relief under the standards of Stefanelli v. Minard, 342 U. S. 117, 122, and Douglas v. City of Jeannette, 319 U. S. 157, 163. As the Court's opinion points out, the factors which justified the issuance of an injunction in Rea are not present here.

The dissenters in Rea agreed that this power exists. See 350 U. S., at 219.

In fact, the only remedy sought by the court is to suppress evidence against the officers who conducted the illegal search on Petder.

On January 7, 1981 in Louisville, Kentucky, Barbel Poore was found unconscious in the back seat of her automobile after she failed to return from work. The police investigation led by Petitioner began to lead to the arresting of three suspects --Kevin Stanford, Troy John, and David ""Petiter"" --and their subsequent confessions. They were charged with capital murder and all charges related to events surrounding the crime were based on incidents that occurred during the time of Poore's visit to the gas station. After Johnson had been held over at juvenile court, petitioner and Leonard were arrested for capital murder as well as several other charges. Both petitioners requested that the verdict not be ""deathqualified,"" but the court granted them both motions to dismiss the capital part of the charge against him because he did not intend to kill Poor E. Poore. At the trial, Elam reads reports from several progress reports while petitioner has been hospitalized. When the prosecutor asked Elam about a psychological assessment performed by Dr. Robert J.G. Lange, the judge allowed Elam to see the report before the jury. However, the court denied Elam's request to read the report through crossexamination. The court also rejected petitioner's argument that the prosecution should have introduced the report directly into the proceedings when it was necessary to determine petitioner&#8216his ability to stand trial since he refused to answer any more questions. The Supreme Court rejects petitioner1s claim that there are no unfair cross section violations due to the fact that only one juror opposes the death penalty can serve as a juror. It furthermore considers the question of whether the same jury will decide the entire issue of the capital case. If the Commonwealth wants to use a different jury for each phase of the criminal trial, it would need to employ a single juror who could find the facts regarding the crimes involved.

An indigent defense lawyer cannot ignore his professional obligations to refuse to pursue a plea-barrel appeal. A trial lawyer cannot serve the interests of a client without asserting particular grounds for reassuring reversals at trial. When counsel believes that an appeal will be frivolously, he can ask leave to withdraw. However, when counsel has concluded that there are other arguments that could support the appeal, the lawyer must submit a written summary of the facts and law supporting the case.

However, the court has now refused to apply the doctrine of noerr to private organizations like the National Fire Protect Association, which publishes safety standards and then passes them to state governments for approval.

When the sovereign applies different rules to different segments of its jurisdiction, it must have a rational basis for doing so. “The term ‘rational,’ of course, includes a requirement that an impartial lawmaker could logically believe that the classification would serve a legitimate public purpose that transcends the harm to the members of the disadvantaged class.” Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, Inc., 473 U. S. 432, 452 (1985) (Stevens, J., concurring) (footnote omitted). In this case, Justice Marshall accurately explicates the harm to certain members of the disadvantaged class. And since the Supreme Court of the State of North Dakota has unequivocally identified the actual purpose of the geographic discrimination, I would not second-guess that conclusion and presume that the harm Justice Marshall describes has been imposed for other reasons.
The State Supreme Court explained:
“The obvious purpose of such legislation is to encourage school district reorganization with a concomitant tax base expansion and an enhanced and more effective school system. The legislation provides incentive for the people to approve school district reorganization by alleviating parental concerns regarding the cost of student transportation in the reorganized district.” 402 N. W. 2d 897, 903 (1987).
This explanation of the state legislative purpose makes two propositions perfectly clear. First, free bus transportation is an important component of public education in a sparsely populated State; otherwise the alleviation of parental concerns regarding the cost of student transportation in a reorganized district could not have been expected to motivate a significant number of voters. Second, after the voters in a school district have had a fair opportunity to decide whether *473or not to reorganize,* there is no longer any justification at all for allowing the nonreorganized districts to place an obstacle in the paths of poor children seeking an education in some parts of the State that has been removed in other parts of the State. Cf. G. D. Searle & Co. v. Cohn, 455 U. S. 404, 420 (1982) (Stevens, J., dissenting) (“[T]he Constitution requires a rational basis for the special burden imposed on the disfavored class as well as a reason for treating that class differently”).
Thus, the State Supreme Court’s explanation of the purpose of this discrimination does not include the “elements of legitimacy and neutrality that must always characterize the performance of the sovereign’s duty to govern impartially.” Cleburne, supra, at 452 (footnote omitted). Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.

As the majority recognizes, the North Dakota Legislature has encouraged reorganization since 1947. See ante, at 453.

1163,9431431,112135,020lead,"In this case, the Court argues that a manufacturer of military equipment can be held responsible for defects in its products because state law does not allow for such claims. The case concerns David Boyle, an American Marine pilot who was killed during a combat exercise. He brought suit against Sikorsky division of United Technologies Corp. on charges of defecting a device in the flight control systems and failing to design the escape hatch. The court found that Boyle failed to meet her burden of presenting two theories of fault under Virginia tort laws. First, Boyle claimed that Sikorski had repaired a machine called the Servo in the automatic flight controlsystem, which alleged malfunctions and caused the accident. Second, Boyles claimed that it had defectively built the escape-hatched handle. The jury awarded $725,000. Petitioners appealed to the Court of Appeal to determine whether there is any justification for shielding government employees from liability for designs in military equipment as well as whether the Court's interpretation of federal law is inappropriate. The Court rejected petitioner's claim that ""in the absence of legislative specifically immuniziating Government contractors from Liability for Defects in Military Equipment."" However, Petyer asserts that even unless Congress has explicitly prescribed federal law forbidding or requiring contract defects, courts have refused to find pre-emptance of state law by federal law when necessary. This case also involves civil liability due to federal officials taking part in the construction of dikes. Although the Federal Government's interests in the purchase of equipment are implicated by lawsuits such as these, we do not see how they can be displaced by state law. It is clear that the conflict between federal policy and state law will always arise in situations where both parties are involved. For example, if a private party seeks to enforce a duty against a contractor, but the contract itself states that the duty must include safety features, then the private party cannot sue the manufacturer for his negligence. Thus, the argument presented here is too broad. If the government were to prohibit suit upon the manufacturer whenever fertilizes would result in injury to military personnel, then even civilians could sue against the manufacturer; however, since Feres only covers service-related accidents, no harm could be prevented.

When judges are asked to embark on a lawmaking venture, I believe they should carefully consider whether they, or a legislative body, are better equipped to perform the task at hand. There are instances of so-called interstitial lawmaking that inevitably become part of the judicial process.1 But when we are asked to create an entirely new doctrine — to answer “questions of policy on which Congress has not spoken,” United States v. Gilman, 347 U. S. 507, 511 (1954) — we have a special duty to identify the proper decisionmaker before trying to make the proper decision.
*532When the novel question of policy involves a balancing of the conflicting interests in the efficient operation of a massive governmental program and the protection of the rights of the individual — whether in the social welfare context, the civil service context, or the military procurement context — I feel very deeply that we should defer to the expertise of the Congress. That is the central message of the unanimous decision in Bush v. Lucas, 462 U. S. 367 (1983);2 that is why I joined the majority in Schweiker v. Chilicky, ante, p. 412,3 a case decided only three days ago; and that is why I am so distressed by the majority’s decision today. For in this case, as in United States v.

 I recognize without hesitation that judges do and must legislate, but they can do so only interstitially; they are confined from molar to molecular motions.

The definition of ""rule"" in the APA does not mean that rules have immediate legal consequences; instead, they are intended to be subject to future effects. However, the phrase ""for the future"" refers to changing the law in order to alter its meaning. This means that an order cannot be effective until it is made into law. Thus, the only alternative to ordering orders is to make them immediately effective. Furthermore, all orders have ""Future effect,"" which means that they will change the law as soon as they are issued.

It is clear that the definition of ""correct amount"" does not apply to payments made by monthly installments, but it does not mean that the actual amount due must be adjusted.

Although Congress has explicitly instructed the Secretary not to do so, the majority of cases in which overpayments or under payments are made are undisputed. However, some claimants seek the Secretary's authority to waiver requests for payment from certain beneficiaries who have been overpaid. The Constitution requires the Secretary to recognize that there is a ""factual event"" that must be ignored when making such an overpayment; therefore, the law does not apply to any case where more than the proper amount of payment was made. For example, if the beneficiary receives a $300 overpayment, it would be against his good conscience to ask the secretary to waive the entire payment. If the beneficiary were innocently overpaying, then the government will take back money and pay back the excess. This means that the beneficiary may spend the overpayment without realizing how much the government actually takes back. Therefore, the fact that the United States pretends that only one month has passed since the date of the first overpayment is flatly contradicted by the statute's command that ""Equity and Good conscience"" should determine the right to request forgiveness. Thus, even though the laws provide for netting as long as the amounts due are paid, the actual amount cannot be determined. Furthermore, the definition of monthly payments makes it impossible for the Secretary either to calculate the exact amount of repayment or to recover the full amount at once.

I am not convinced, as the other Members of the Court appear to be, that the order with which we are concerned is a final decision. It seems to me that the Court in its opinion expends its energy fending off respondent’s arguments as to nonappealability, without itself demonstrating finality in a positive way.
I concur in the judgment, however. Although I think the order is not a final decision under 28 U. S. C. § 1291, it is immediately appealable under the collateral order doctrine enunciated in Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., 337 U. S. 541 (1949). This is the view adopted by the great majority of the Courts of Appeals, and I am in agreement with their conclusions. See, e. g., Colon v.

*101Justice Stevens,
concurring in part and dissenting in part.
While I agree with the Court’s conclusion that the filing deadline in 42 U. S. C. §2000e-16(c) is subject to equitable tolling and that the petitioner has failed to establish a basis for tolling in this case, I do not agree that the 30-day limitations period began to run when petitioner’s lawyer, rather than petitioner himself, received notice from the EEOC of petitioner’s right to file a civil action.
The Court is entirely correct that notice to a litigant’s attorney is generally considered notice to the litigant after litigation has been commenced. See ante, at 92-93. But the Court overlooks the fact that litigation is usually commenced by service of process on the adverse party himself. Indeed, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure expressly require service on the opposing litigant. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 4(d). This case involves a notice that is a condition precedent to the commencement of formal litigation. I therefore believe that Congress intended that this notice, like a summons and complaint, be served on the adverse party, not his representative.
The Court contends that reading “the term ‘receipt’ [in § 2000e-16(c)] to mean only ‘actual receipt by the claimant’ would render the practice of notification through counsel a meaningless exercise.” Ante, at 93. By the same logic, however, reading “receipt,” as the Court does, to mean only “receipt by the claimant’s representative” renders “a meaningless exercise” the EEOC’s practice of notifying the claimant personally, a practice codified in EEOC regulations, see 29 CFR § 1613.234(a) (1990). Actually, notifying both the claimant and his representative makes sense regardless of which notice begins the ticking of the limitations clock. Dual notification ensures that all persons concerned with the progress of the action are apprised of important developments. Cf. ibid, (also requiring notification of employing agency). However, a claimant’s representative before the *102EEOC will not necessarily also represent the claimant in the ensuing civil suit; indeed, the representative in the administrative proceedings need not even be an attorney. See § 1613.214(b). Notice to the claimant is therefore the more logical trigger for the limitations countdown. This construction is not only sensible in light of the notice requirement’s function in the statutory scheme, but is also consistent with our previous admonitions that Title VII, a remedial statute, should be construed in favor of those whom the legislation was designed to protect. See Zipes v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 455 U. S. 385, 397-398 (1982); Love v. Pullman Co., 404 U. S. 522, 527 (1972).
Accordingly, I respectfully dissent from the Court’s judgment. I would instead reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for resolution of the disputed factual issue of when the petitioner himself actually received notice from the EEOC of his right to file a civil action.

I agree that this appeal must be dismissed for failure to present a real and substantial controversy which unequivocally calls for adjudication of the rights claimed in advance of any attempt by the State to curtail them by criminal prosecution. I am not convinced, on this skimpy record, that these appellants as individuals are truly caught in an inescapable dilemma. The true controversy in this case is over the opening of birth-control clinics on a large scale; it is that which the State has prevented in the past, not the use of contraceptives by isolated and-individual married couples. It will be time enough to decide the constitutional questions urged upon us when, if ever, that real controversy flares up again. Until it does, or until the State makes a definite and concrete threat to enforce these laws against individual married couples — a threat which it has never made in the past except under the provocation of litigation — this Court may not be compelled to exercise its most delicate power of constitutional adjudication.

He rejects the use of declaratory judgment as a means for determining whether a statute violates the Constitution's Article III rights. In particular, he contends that there is ""an agreement"" between the state and the states regarding the enforcement of these laws. However, the court believes that such an agreement cannot be enforced because no lawyer or police official would advise his client to do so.

The second claim is asserted that the statute does not infringe on the privacy of married couples; the third claim is an assertion that the Constitution requires ""due process"" for its decisions. The fourth claim concerns the lack of evidence against the petitioners because they have no real interest in vindicating their rights. The fifth claim is related to the absence of further prosecutions since the state has refused to prosecute anyone who violates or refuses to enforce the contraceptive laws. The court believes that these cases are analogous to other cases where there is no real dispute about the validity of a particular claim. It also believes that the case is too remote to be presented as a hypothetical suit with no real interests in vindication. However, both opinions believe that the plaintiffs have some legitimate right not to go through with any legal proceedings. They argue that the only thing that stands between them when they are informed that they will be forced to perform criminally charged actions is the threat of being arrested. This argument is supported by the fact that neither the courts nor the Supreme Court supports the notion that such action would lead to a successful prosecution. Furthermore, although the State has tried to change the law since the time of the Nelson trial, none of those attempts have succeeded.

Gulf also gets a temporary license to sell interstate commerce at an unlimited rate. After this decision, El Paso petitions the Federal Power Council to grant permission to sell its remaining gas reserves to other customers without prior approval. The court disagrees with this interpretation but agrees that it would be inappropriate for El Pasto to sell their remaining gas to another customer without seeking abandonment permission from the commission. The Court furthermore decides that the fundamental purpose of federal law is to assure adequate and reliable supplies of gas at reasonably prices. Under the Act, no natural gas company may abandon all or some portion of its facility subject to the authority by the commission, or any services rendered by such facilities without the approval of the commission first had and obtained after due hearing. If the service cannot be granted, the company will have to find a way to dispose of the entire supply of gas before it can be used again. This means that once the gas begins to flow into state lines, it cannot be terminated until the Commission grants permission to do so. It was held that even after a contract ended, the producer could still continue under an obligation not to provide gas to the pipeline because the terms of the contract did not extend beyond the expiration date of the agreement. Finally, the Court concludes that there must be a clear distinction between the ""underlying service"" to the public and the specific manifestation of the contractual relationship which that service took at a particular moment. Thus, when the gas flows into interstate market from the lessee's own property, the producers need only seek a certificate delimiting the duration of the service.

The Court has ruled that lessors do not need to seek approval of an abandonment provision under the Act because their leases are for 50 years. Gulf Oil Company entered into two different leases with Southland royalty co. through which they obtained exclusive rights to explore, develop, and market natural gas from certain acreages in Texas. They were granted a royalty on the quantity or quantity of gas produced by the wells. However, as more than one owner of the mineral rights, it was the largest owner. When the lease expired, Gulf sold its casing head gas to the El paso Natural Gas company, an inter-state pipeline. This sale was then governed by the Federal Power commission. Shortly after the leases expire, however, Southlander and other mineral feeowners began selling their casing heads gas in the Intrastate market. After the lease term had passed, Elpaso petitioned the F.P.C. to determine whether the leaseholder gas could be dedicated to inter state commerce. The court reversed the decision. It held that Gulf's right to dedicate all of the gas within 50 years was subject to contingency; therefore, any portion of the remaining gas must be dedicated directly to interstate trade. The petitioners contend that since Gulf did not have the power to commit such a long service obligation, the lessor may never abandon the contract without the approval of the federal government. Sunray Oil appeals to the Court's jurisdictional developments in the Natural Gas act. A natural gas company can only devote part of its gas to intercity commerce when it makes a commitment to make interstate sales. If the company does not wish to renew the lease, it cannot abandon the business without the permission of the Congress. Therefore, the petitioners argue against the authority of the legislature to require lessees to dedicate their own gas to ""interstate commerce.""

After the construction of the Alaskan Pipeline system, petitioners filed protests against the proposed rates and asked the commission to reconsider them. The court granted the petition but denied it on October 20, 1977. The Court then decided that the commission had the authority to suspend an initial rate as well as change in tariffs. Four petitioners sought review of the commission's suspension order; the court found that the Commission did not have sufficient authority to hold initial rates before they could be suspended; that the decision not to allow carriers to file interim prices was unlawful; and that the carrier must make refunds for any amounts collected after the suspension date. Finally, the court determined that the commissioner had the right to suspend first-rates only when there were changes in the actual rate.

It is decided that states can receive federal funds as long as they comply with the requirements set out in the Title IVA Act.

Instead, it must include money payments; other kinds of help provided on 'temporary basis' to avoid Destitution; or to provide Living arrangements. Illinois adopts an entirely different type of emergency assistance program.

It did not allow farmers to form collectives for processing or selling their products; instead, it allowed them to form ""collectively processing, preparation for market, handle, and marketing"" activities. This legislation prevented these small, individual farms from being forced to move to the cities where they could compete with larger companies. The Capper Volstead Act was intended to improve the situation by allowing farmers to join together in groups so as to replace the middlemen who were responsible for buying and selling farm products.

However, the majority opinion does not link this reasoning to the motivations behind the Act's provision for antitrust immunity. It is believed that farmers face perishability because they cannot compete with middlemen who can drive prices down below the price of their product. The Capper- Volstead Act was designed to protect farmers from being caught in the arms of organized middlemen. This meant that farmers could combine with their neighbors and become a corporation. The purpose of the Act was to prevent middlemen from selling their products at a high price. The market for fresh broilers was dominated by many large retail chains including A &P, Kroger, and Safeway. The buyer's market for these chickens was oligopisonistic. The overwhelming demands are for fresh, rather than frozen, 8to 10 week-old broileer chickens; andintegrors must sold their produce within 4 days of slaughtering. The result is an buyers market. The major opposition to the bill is that it would exempt processors who do not produce agricultural products. The argument is that such companies are not producers but simply distributors. The Senate rejected the proposal on the grounds that there were no other risks involved. The main issue concerns ownership of land. Antitrust protection was required for the cooperative activities of unable to organize in corporate form. Thus, the farmer had to sell his product to the lowest bidder in the marketplace. If the farmer wanted to be protected, he should have to hire his grower into an employee. The majority believes that the act did not extend antitrust prohibition to owners of land or untiling the soil: it proves faithful, in spite of the economic realities inherent in Congress' concern for agriculture.",1978-06-12,1.0

Despite the perhaps technically correct observation, ante, at 344 — 345, that the Court is “consider [ing] here for the first time the limitation that the Eighth Amendment . . . imposes upon the conditions in which a State may confine those convicted of crimes,” it obviously is not writing upon a clean slate. See Hutto v. Finney, 437 U. S. 678, 685-688 (1978); cf. Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U. S. 520 (1979). Already, concerns about prison conditions and their constitutional significance have been expressed by the Court.
Jackson v. Bishop, 404 F. 2d 571 (CA8 1968), cited by both Justice Brennan, and by Justice Marshall in dissent here, was, I believe, one of the first cases in which a federal court examined state penitentiary practices and held them to be violative of the Eighth Amendment’s proscription of “cruel and unusual punishments.” I sat on that appeal, and I was *369privileged to write the opinion for a unanimous panel of the court. My voting in at least one prison case since then further discloses my concern about the conditions that sometimes are imposed upon confined human beings. See, e. g., United States v. Bailey, 444 U. S. 394, 419, 424 (1980) (dissenting opinion).
I perceive, as Justice Brennan obviously does in view of his separate writing, a possibility that the Court’s opinion in this case today might be regarded, because of some of its language, as a signal to prison administrators that the federal courts now are to adopt a policy of general deference to such administrators and to state legislatures, deference not only for the purpose of determining contemporary standards of decency, ante, at 346, but for the purpose of determining whether conditions at a particular prison are cruel and unusual within the meaning of the Eighth Amendment, ante, at 349-352. That perhaps was the old attitude prevalent several decades ago. I join Justice Brennan’s opinion because I, too, feel that the federal courts must continue to be available to those state inmates who sincerely claim that the conditions to which they are subjected are violative of the Amendment. The Court properly points out in its opinion, ante, at 347, that incarceration necessarily, and constitutionally, entails restrictions, discomforts, and a loss of privileges that complete freedom affords. But incarceration is not an open door for unconstitutional cruelty or neglect. Against that kind of penal condition, the Constitution and the federal courts, it is to be hoped, together remain as an available bastion.

This means that even if the plaintiff can bring a federal complaint under state law but still maintains an independent right to relief under federal law, there will be no need for the federal court to look beyond the faces of the first pleading when deciding whether a Federal Question is presented.

They are not necessarily immune from suits for violations of the law or constitutional rights. The majority disagrees with Butz's view that all federal officers are entitled to ""absolute immunity."" However, the court rejects the notion that absolute immunity extends to specific functions. For example, a president may deliberately cause serious harm to anyone even though it is obvious that his conduct violates the Constitution or other laws. If the president orders Fitzgerald fired by a reduction in force and does not comply with the civil service rules, he will be immune from any suit against him. He would also be immune whether he ordered an officer to break into home so that he could install a hearing device.

It also means that Congress cannot provide remedies against presidential misconduct and criminal laws as long as the President acts effectively. Finally, there is no argument that the office of the president should be immune only from legislative acts. The Supreme Court has consistently held that the government must be of laws rather than of men. Thus, although the courts have always been guided by common law tradition, their decisions regarding the power of the presidency do not lie solely on the principle of unity of powers. Although the Constitution explicitly states that the presidency is immune from such claims, the case at hand is one of two arguments: 1) absolute immunity is implicit; and 2) absolute immunity requires separation of powers between the executive and legislative branches. Petitioners argue that the Articles of Confederation guarantee absolute immunity to members of Congress. Hamilton defends the impeaching process but points out that the people were concerned about the possibility of having the president impeach himself.

Both sides believe that the independence required by the Constitution was not realized until the first session of the Senate.

Although I do not believe that the “reckless disregard” component of the New York Times malice standard is a question of historical fact, I agree with Justice Rehnquist that the actual-knowledge component surely is. Here, the District Court found that the defamatory statement was written with actual knowledge of falsity. The Court of Appeals thus erred in basing its disagreement with the District Court on its de novo review of the record. The majority is today equally in error. I would remand to the Court of Appeals so that it may perform its task under the proper standard.

Justice Blackmun,
concurring.
I join the Court’s opinion but add a personal observation.
I yield to no one in my profound personal concern about the unwillingness of our national consciousness to face up to — and to do something about — the continuing slaughter upon our Nation’s highways, a good percentage of which is due to drivers who are drunk or semi-incapacitated because of alcohol or drug ingestion. I have spoken in these Reports to this point before. Perez v. Campbell, 402 U. S. 637, 657, and 672 (1971) (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part); Tate v. Short, 401 U. S. 395, 401 (1971) (concurring opinion). See also South Dakota v. Neville, 459 U. S. 553, 555-559 (1983).
And it is amazing to me that one of our great States — one which, by its highway signs, proclaims to be diligent and emphatic in its prosecution of the drunken driver — still classifies driving while intoxicated as a civil violation that allows only a money forfeiture of not more than $300 so long as it is a first offense. Wis. Stat. §346.65(2)(a) (Supp. 1983-1984). The State, like the indulgent parent, hesitates to discipline the spoiled child very much, even though the child is engaging in an act that is dangerous to others who are law abiding and helpless in the face of the child’s act. See ante, at 754, n. 14 (citing other statutes). Our personal convenience still weighs heavily in the balance, and the highway deaths and *756injuries continue. But if Wisconsin and other States choose by legislation thus to regulate their penalty structure, there is, unfortunately, nothing in the United States Constitution that says they may not do so.

He defends the state's Constitution-protected authority to arrest someone without a valid warrant in cases where there is reasonable grounds for making an arrest. Madison police officers arrested Edward Welsh for driving while intoxicating and his driver's license was revocationd for sixty days. The Supreme Court disagreed with the court's interpretation of the Fourth Amendment; however, it recognized that the Wisconsin law violated the constitutional rights of the individual by prohibiting him from being arrested without any warrant. It also rejected the argument that the state should not have had enough evidence against Welsh because its laws were so strict regarding alcohol testing. However, the case does not merit further discussion as to whether the State ought to consider the nature of the offense involved in justifying warrantlessness in-home charges.",1984-05-15,1.0
1448,9429600,111175,020lead,"In March of 1979, a group of taxpayers and co-signers known as the ""Tax Payers for Vincent"" entered into an agreement with a company called Candidates' Outdoor Graphics Servite to post political posters on utility pole crosseswires. The City Council is prohibited from placing signs on public land in any way that would violate the First Amendment; however, it does not prohibit anyone from carrying or displaying political signs on other public property. The Court decides that the prohibition only applies to those who are free to express their views without fear of being subjected to excessive restrictions on their freedom of expression. It also determines that there are sufficient reasons why the prohibition should not be extended to private property because the private citizen's interests in controlling his own property will keep the ban from further restricting expressive activity.",1984-05-15,1.0
1449,9429601,111175,040dissent,"The Court dissents from the majority opinion that the City could ban the use of signs in order to preserve and improve the aesthetic appearance of the city. Because the court's strict approach toward the restriction of speeches for reason of aesthetics is too harsh, the court finds that the ""interest"" behind the ban is sufficient to justify the effects of the ban on speech. In contrast, Los Angeles's total ban on political signs violates the First Amendment because it severely restricts the ability by the government to communicate with its citizens. This paper discusses some of the specific issues involved in deciding whether or not an important medium should be allowed to communicate. Signs are particularly valuable because they can reach a large audience, allow flexible formats, typographys, and graphic images, and convey its message in such a way that is easily understood by its listener or reader. However, there are other alternative means of communication that would serve the needs of the plaintiffs more well than the prohibition on signs. Although the City does not explicitly state this fact, however, courts must carefully examine the justification offered by the City for its ban before making decisions. A law cannot be upheld solely as an interest in artistic judgments; rather, it must be substantial enough to justify restrictions of speech. Thus, when the government asserts that the sign constitutes ""visual clutter,"" the court must first determine whether the particular objective beyond which the restriction is pursued is substantial. If the object is only ""aestheticallydispleasing,"" then the court will have difficulty finding out whether the government actually intends to accomplish the goal. For example: if the City wants to eliminate all public signs throughout the city, but instead decides to reduce the number of them posted, the only solution is to abolish the entire city. Therefore, even if both goals are substantial, the decision may be invalidated since the purpose of banning these temporary signs is simply to erase the visual clutter created by those signs.",1984-05-15,1.0

At the trial, the three named plaintiffs testify that they have no constitutional rights under the Constitution because their cases are so short. However, the court concludes that most of the detained children will either be dismissed before adjudication or are released later after adjudication. This conclusion does not satisfy the Due Process Clever Clause of Article 1, Section 2: ""The combined interest in protection both the community as well asthe juvenile itself from the consequencesof future criminal conduct."" Thus, we must first decide whether the practice conforms with the ""fundamental Fairness"" required by the Due Procedure Clause.

The provision allows a judge to decide whether or not a juvenile should be held for 17 days if there is ""a substantial probability"" that the child will not appear at court on the following day. In these cases, the judge finds that there is sufficient reason to believe that the crime committed by the child would cause serious risk in the future. Although the statute does not explicitly state how likely it is that a young person will commit an act before trial, the fact that such a risk exists makes it necessary for the judge to make decisions regarding the safety of the youth.

However, they argue that the prohibition on pretrial detention only applies to children because the Constitution protects liberty from restraint under the Due-Process Clause. They also argue that even if some of the purposes advanced by the provision are accomplished, the government cannot justify detention of innocent children without a finding as to whether there is enough evidence against the child to warrant further detention.

1453,9429643,111201,020lead,"The case concerns a new authority granted to the Interstate Commerce Commissioner to reject effective motor carrier tariffs. This authority is related to Congress's Motor Carriers Act of 1980, which gives the commission power to approve and deny rate bureau agreements that violate the terms of an approved contract. Although the proposed remedy is not explicitly delegated by Congress, it is closely related to its express powers and is intended to achieve ""objjec356ives"" set for the commission by Congress. In order to receive this immunity from antitrust law, motor carriers must submit collective rate agreements to the commission. However, since Congress passed the MCA in 2000, the federal government has been reluctant to approve rate bureau contracts because they are inconsistent with national policy. Since the original Reed Bulwinkle Act allowed the ICC to determine whether rate bureaus were consistent with American transportation policy, the current legislation allows the ICA to decide which rate bureau agreement conforms to the standards established by Congress under the Motor Cartrier Act of 80. A few years ago, however, Congress changed the rules for rate bureau approval so that rates can be rejected retroactively as long as proof of substantial violations proves to be valid. If proving a serious or continuing violation results in overcharge charges, the affected carriers may bring action against the rejected tariff; otherwise, the rejected rate will become the applicable rate for the period after which motor carriers charge the rejected price. Thus, any proposal submitted by a rate bureau member does not violate the conditions of the agreed-upon agreement. Furthermore, if there is a significant breach of the agreement, the entire amount of the rejected fee will be charged to the injured shipper. Finally, even though the rejection of a certain rate cannot be found, the burden of finding a violator falls on the carrier.",1984-08-02,2.0

Congress enacts the Pacific Northwest Electrical Power Planning and Carbon Reduction Act of 1980, which requires Bpa to issue new contracts to several customers. This case concerns the provision in the contract that makes certain that some portion of power sold to DsIs can be interrupted at any time.

The court disagrees, arguing that the quality of power offered under the new agreements is different than the quality offered under their earlier contracts. In the case of a customer who receives power that is not freely interruptible, it means that the customer receives less power than she was entitled to under her 1975 contracts. Thus, even though the ""quality"" of power provided under the newly-enacted contracts is higher than what the customer received under the previous contracts, the customer still receives greater power than they had been entitled under the75 contracts.",1984-06-05,1.0

Congress, by the three-year statute of limitations that bars assessments of tax deficiencies except (so far as relevant here) in case of fraud, 26 U. S. C. §§ 6501 (a) and (c), has brought into being a “statute of repose” 1 that I would respect more highly than my Brethren. I would respect it by requiring the District Court to be satisfied that the Service is not acting capriciously in reopening the closed tax period. Since the agency must go to the court for process to compel the production of the records for the closed tax period, I would insist that the District Court act in a judicial capacity, free to disagree with the administrative decision unless that minimum standard is met.2
Oklahoma Press Pub. Co. v. Walling, 327 U. S. 186, does not seem to me to be relevant. It dealt with the usual investigative powers of administrative agencies; and as the Court said in that case, Congress set no standards for administrative action which the judiciary first had to weigh and appraise.3 Id., 215-216. Here *60we have a congressional “statute of repose” embodied in the three-year statute of limitations. I would make it, meaningful by protecting it from invasion by mere administrative fiat. Where the limitations period has expired, an examination is presumptively “unnecessary” within the meaning of § 7605 (b) — a presumption the Service must overcome. That is to say, a re-examination of the taxpayer’s records after the three-year period is “unnecessary” within the meaning of § 7605 (b), unless the District Court is shown something more than mere caprice for believing fraud was practiced on the revenue. Without that minimum safeguard the statutory status of repose becomes rather meaningless.

 See the remarks of Senators Smith, Ashurst, and Reed in 67 Cong. Rec. 3852-3853.


 The First Circuit requires the Commissioner to show that “a reasonable basis exists for a suspicion of fraud,” O’Connor v. O’Connell, 253 F. 2d 365, 370; the Ninth Circuit requires that the decision to investigate for fraud appear as “a matter of rational judgment based on the circumstances of the particular case,” De Masters v. Arend, 313 F. 2d 79, 90; the Third Circuit requires that the agent’s suspicion of fraud be “reasonable” in the eyes of the District Court. 325 F. 2d 914, 916.


 The case is more like United States v. Morton Salt Co., 338 U. S. 632, where, as respects the power of the Federal Trade Commission *60to require issuance of “special” reports, the Court reserved the right to prevent the “arbitrary” exercise of that administrative power. Id., at 654.*,

  Mr. Justice Harlan
 

  delivered the opinion of the Court.
 

  In August 1961, Internal Revenue Agent Whelan issued a summons to taxpayer Ryan ordering him to pro-ducé his books for the years 1942 through 1953 inclusive. Ryan appeared but refused to produce the records, claiming that because tax liability for those years was long since barred except for fraud,
  
   1
  
  the agent had no right to examine the records unless he could show grounds for suspecting fraud.
 

  The Government then instituted an enforcement proceeding in a federal district court pursuant to § 7402 (b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.
  
   2
  
  The complaint alleged that on the basis of estimated net worth calcula
   
   *62
   
  tions the agent' strongly suspected fraud, and that examination of the records for the years in question was relevant and material in determining its existence. The taxpayer answered, putting the question of probable cause in issue, and, in addition, stating that he had not received the letter required by § 7605 (b) informing him that the Secretary or his delegate had determined the examination to be necessary.
  
   3
  


  At the hearing the District Judge clearly indicated his opinion that the Government need not show probable cause for suspecting fraud, and ordered Ryan to produce those records which he had available. Although the hearing confirmed Ryan’s assertion that no “necessity letter” had been sent to him, the judge made no mention of this, probably because counsel did not press the point.
 

  The Court of Appeals affirmed, 320 F. 2d 500, on the theory that no full-scale showing of probable cause need be made. Except for the records relating to the year 1945, which appeared to have been once previously examined, the court ruled that no necessity letter was required by § 7605 (b) because the Government had made no previous examination of those years.!
 

  We granted certiorari, 376 U. S.. 904, on the only issue raised by petitioner, whether the Government must show probable cause for its examination of the records.

For reasons stated at greater length in my opinions concurring in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254, 293, and dissenting in Beauharnais v. Illinois, 343 U. S. 250, 267, as well as in the opinion of Mr. Justice Douglas in this case, infra, p.'80, I concur in reversing the conviction of appellant Garrison, based as it is purely on his public discussion and criticism of public officials. I believe that the First Amendment, made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth, protects every person from having a State or the Federal Government fine, imprison, or assess damages against him when he has been guilty of no conduct, see Giboney v. Empire Storage & Ice Co., 336 U. S. 490, 498, other than expressing an opinion, even though others may believe that his views are unwholesome, unpatriotic, stupid or dangerous. I believe that the Court is mistaken if it thinks that requiring proof that *80statements were “malicious” or “defamatory” will really create any substantial hurdle to block public officials from punishing those who criticize the way they conduct their office. Indeed, “malicious,” “seditious,” and other such evil-sounding words often have been invoked to punish people for expressing their views on public affairs. Fining men or sending them to jail for criticizing public officials not only jeopardizes-the free, open public discussion which our Constitution guarantees, but can wholly stifle it. I would hold now and not wait to hold later, compare Betts v. Brady, 316 U. S. 455, overruled in Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335, that under our Constitution there is absolutely no place in this country for the old, discredited English Star Chamber law of seditious criminal libel.

1472,9422885,106935,030concurrence,"In this paper, Douglas defends the First Amendment's guarantee of freedom of speech and argues that it is unrecognizable. The Supreme Court has already held that criticizing an official for his conduct was protected under the First and Fourth Amendments unless there were proof of actual ""malice."" If malice exists, then Congress will be able to punish those who do not act with malice in mind. This means that even if someone does not have actual malice, they can still be punished. Douglas contends that the only penalty drawn by the constitution is between ""speech"" on one side and ""conduct or overt actions on the other,"" which are often blended. For example, Holmes said that the Constitution did not leave the common law as to libe in force. However, Justice Douglas points out that the sedition Act was intended to protect the states from usurping their sovereignties. Madison asserted that the state sovereignties were diminished by powers specific enough to carry them into effect. He also claimed that Congress had the same power of legislation as the federal government; therefore, Congress would have the same authority to pass laws against the free flow of the American people. Thus, we cannot believe that the Articles of Confederation allowed Congress to limit the rights of the states. It was believed that the separation of powers could prevent usurpations from taking place within the country. Therefore, the definition of powers allows Congress to take advantage of the power of the public to enforce its laws. That is, every government has the ability to control itself. So, congress may decide what is wrong with a particular religion, but no one knows how to stop it.",1964-11-23,2.0

Mr. Justice Clark,
with whom Mr. Justice Black joins,
dissenting.
The Supreme Court of Ohio, 175 Ohio St. 73, 74, 191 N. E. 2d 825, 827, “determined” the following facts in this case:
“The Cleveland police had good reason to believe that defendant was regularly engaged in carrying on *98a scheme of chance involving clearinghouse slips. There was testimony that he had previously been convicted on that score. Information was given to the police by an informer that defendant would be in a certain locality at a certain time pursuing his unlawful activities. He was found in that locality, as predicted, driving an automobile. Police officers stopped the car and searched it, without result. Defendant was then arrested and taken to a police station, and his clothing was examined, resulting in the discovery and seizure of the illegal clearinghouse slips, which formed the basis of the charge against him and his subsequent conviction.”
These are the facts upon which Ohio’s highest court based its opinion and they have support in the. record.
The syllabus rule, Rule VI, peculiar to that State and of which the majority speaks, was promulgated in 1858, 5 Ohio St. vii, and provides:
“A syllabus of the. points decided by the Court in each case, shall be stated, in writing, by the Judge assigned to. deliver the opinion of the Court, which shall be confined tti the points of law, arising from the facts of the case, that have been determined by the Court. . . .” (Emphasis supplied.)
As my late Brother of revered memory, Mr. Justice Burton of Ohio, said in the Ohio case of Perkins v. Benguet Consol. Mining Co., 342 U. S. 437, 442, n. 3 (1952), “[a] syllabus must be read in the light of the facts in the case, even where brought out in the accompanying opinion rather than in the syllabus itself.” The good Justice was only following Ohio’s own cases. See Williamson Heater Co. v. Radich, 128 Ohio St. 124, 190 N. E. 403 (1934) ; Perkins v. Bright, 109 Ohio St. 14, 19-20, 141 N. E. 689, 690 (1923); In re Poage, 87 Ohio St. 72, 82-83, 100 N. E. 125, 127-128 (1912).
*99The Court ignores these findings entirely. Where the highest court of a State after detailed and earnest consideration determines the facts and they are reasonably supportable, I would let them stand. And I would, of courste, give the same respect to findings of probable cause by ■ United States district courts when approved by United States courts of appeals. Otherwise, this Court will be continually disputing with state and federal courts over the minutiae of facts in every search and seizure case. Especially is this true if the Court disputes the findings sua sponte where, as here, no attack is leveled at them.
Believing that the Ohio Supreme Court’s findings, set out above, fully support its conclusion that probable cause existed, in this case in support of the arrest and the search incident thereto, I would affirm.

Mr. Justice Frankfurter,
dissenting.
While I agree that the amendatory Rules promulgated by the Federal Communications Commission relating to Multiple Ownership of standard, FM and television stations constitute a reviewable “order” within the meaning of 5 U. S. C. § 1034, my Brother Harlan’s reasoning convinces me that the respondent was not on the record before us a “party aggrieved” under that section. Therefore the court below should not have entertained the petition to review the Commission’s order.
Procedural and jurisdictional limitations on judicial action by the federal courts are not playthings of lawyers nor obstructions on the road of justice. Whether formulated by the Constitution, congressional enactments or settled judicial precedents, they are means designed to keep the courts within appropriate limits and to enforce *214rights according to general standards and not have them depend on the impact of the individual case. To be sure, dealing as we are with general standards, differences of views regarding their scope and applicability are bound to arise from time to time. Who is a “party aggrieved” or a “party in interest” turns on the context, often confused and dubious, of a particular set of circumstances and therefore raises issues on which judges not unnaturally divide, as they do on other unmathematical problems of the law. See Singer & Sons v. Union Pacific R. Co., 311 U. S. 295.
To the laity such matters may seem technicalities in a derogatory sense of the term. But this is only one phase of an attitude of mind that thinks ill of law which does not accord with private wishes. When informed by a legal adviser that to carry out his desires would encounter “technical legal difficulties,” a strenuous President of the United States impatiently observed that “all law is technicality.” But even professionally competent officials are at times impatient with decisions that fail to adjudicate substantive issues on which light is sought. It seems to me important, therefore, not to minimize the function of jurisdictional limitations upon adjudication by expressing views on the merits. There are, of course, exceptional situations where it is proper for a dissenter to go to the merits when a majority of the Court removes from the case threshold objections of procedure and jurisdiction. See, e. g., Ashwander v. Tennessee Valley Authority, 297 U. S. 288, 341. This is not such a case.

In retrospect, Lobus realizes that his employer was worth more than it was worth when he exercised these options. The Company deducted this amount as an expense for its 1946 and47 tax returns but did not report anything as income. The Commissioner leviede a deficientiency assessment under  22-a of the internal revenue code of 1939 which defines gross earnings as including ""gains,profits, and income obtained from . any kind and inwhichever form paid."" LoBuE appeals to the court to reconsider the definition of gross income because the provisions do not allow for gifting or other gifts. The Court concludes that LoBuy had a gain if they were intended as additional compensation but not as compensation provided for services.

However, the time when LoBue acquired the interest on which he is taxed was not in issue either before the Tax Court or the Court of Appeals.

When the employee receives an unconditional or instant-equal value option to purchase stock, it is at least as valuable as the price of the stock at the time of the exercise. If the employee sells his stock after the exercise, then the corporation ""gave"" him nothing; in other words, the employee simply converted his asset into stock. The only difference between the two types of grants is that the employee was granted the right to purchase 150 shares when he was notified that 150 had been offered to him. He was given the first allotted stock by June 30, 1945 because he could not be expected to have received any income until that date. This means that he would have to wait until he got enough stock to pay for the initial allotments and then buy the remaining stock. That way, even if the employee were forced to sell his stock before he reached the end of his term, he will still be able to claim the value of his options.",1956-05-28,2.0

If the Constitution gave me a roving commission to impose upon the criminal courts of Texas my own notions of enlightened policy, I would not join the Court’s opinion. For it is clear to me that the recidivist procedures adopted in recent years by many other States1— and by Texas herself since January 1 of last year2 — are far superior to those utilized in the cases now before us.

1565,9423326,107342,040dissent,"In this paper, Justice Warren argues that the Court's decision to admit prior convictions as evidence of guilty does not violate the due process clause because it prejudices the innocent. It also fails to convince the court that there is any legitimate interest in allowing the state to present prior-crime evidence before the accused is found guilty. The Texas legislature has passed an amendment to the law since January 1st, 1966, which makes it easier for states to show that an accused commits a crime when he has been previously arrested. This means that criminals who have committed previous offenses can now be charged with enhanced punishment without having to prove their guilt or innocence at trial. However, the fact that they have been previously incarcerated does not mean that they are guilty; rather, it means that they may have committed other crimes and therefore deserve greater punishment. Thus, even if the jury finds the accused guilty of another crime, it will still be possible for the State -- under certain circumstances -- to convict him of the crime already charged. Therefore, the only way for the States to avoid prejudicial prejudice is to allow the jury to hear all kinds of information about the defendant's past and his medical and mental health history. If the state refuses to accept such a request, however, then the state cannot justify its refusal by showing that ""the probative value"" of the evidence would outweigh the potential prejudice."" For example, if a prisoner was sentenced to death but refused to cooperate with a plea bargain offered by the state, the state could use these facts to decide whether the prisoner should receive a death penalty. Furthermore, unless the state allows the jury hearing all kindsof evidence relevant to sentenncing, no matter how much the prosecutor wants to do so, the entire burden of proof must be left to the juror. Finally, the Supreme Court rejects the argument that the admission of Prior Convictions Evidence solely for purposes of improving punishment might violate due process: ""I recognize that the conditions for decisions in due process are drawn from the tradition of our legal systems rather than from specific constitutional standards.""",1966-11-21,1.0

The Court of Appeals in McNutt v. Duke Precision Dental Orthodontic Laboratories, Inc., 698 F. 2d 676 (CA4 1983), and again in this case, held that in all claims for which no other limitations period is specifically provided, Maryland’s general 3-year period of limitations is the most appropriate for federal courts to apply in actions under the Reconstruction Civil Rights Acts. The Court of Appeals rejected petitioners’ reliance on Maryland’s 6-month period of limitations applicable to state administrative complaints of employment discrimination. As petitioners have adduced no persuasive reason to doubt that the Court of Appeals correctly decided this question, I agree with the judgment of the Court.

The grandfather clause allows the president to use his power under the Twea when an emergency arises, but it does not allow the president any more authority to use the powers granted to him under the Constitution. Because the President has no authority to declare new states of emergency or to renew existing restrictions without gaining a quidic proquo, the Constitution provides for the president with broad authority to respond immediately to crises outside the normal scope of the national emergency. However, this provision only extends the president's ability to respond to crisis situations within the normal range of the executive branch. In addition, the constitution gives the president wide authority to act in times of national emergency as long as the situation is described as ""an extraordinary one."" Some members of Congress believe that the provisions of the TWea have been used as flexible instruments of foreign policy; others believe that these provisions have become ""essentially an unlimited Grant of authority."" They also believe that some of their actions under the Articles have been too weak to deal with actual emergencies. One of the first arguments against having grandfathering was that the president should not be required to give up ""bargaining chips"" without receiving something from the other countries. Others argue that there must be some form of grandfather clause. The House Committee heard testimony about the need for such a clause. It was believed that the government would not be forced into giving up ""Bargaining Chips"" without getting something back from the country on another side of the negotiation.

As the petitioners argue, the judgment of the Court may well be in the best interest of the United States. The regulations upheld today limit Cuba’s ability to acquire hard currency, currency that the Executive has found might be used to support violence and terrorism. Our role is limited, however, to ascertaining and sustaining the intent of Congress. It is the responsibility of the President and Congress to determine the course of the Nation’s foreign affairs. In this case, the legislative history canvassed by Justice Blackmun’s dissenting opinion unmistakably demonstrates that Congress intended to bar the President from expanding the exercise of emergency authority under § 5(b). Contrary to the Court’s view, the meaning of the word “authorities” in the grandfather clause is not “clear,” see ante, at 237, nor in my view is it contrary to the fair import of this history.

As I read it, the plain language of 26 U. S. C. § 9011(b)(1) confers standing on the Democratic National Committee.

This is because the Sherman Act only requires states to make price fixing laws and therefore does not allow private persons to do so.

Finally, there are three respects which cannot possibly be reconciled: first, the description required by the statute is garbled; second, the expression of the statute must be unambiguous; and third, the Bureau itself interprets the provisions to allow a single-year filing on or after December 30. If Congress wanted to use the word ""prison to December 31,"" then the bureau would have had to change the meaning of its regulation so that it could receive a January 19th filing. This means that the claimants will have to file their mining claims on or before November 30, each year. In addition, the BLM has adopted regulations that do not use this language. It is obvious that Congress intends to treat any filed during the year as if it were a timely one.

Their complaint alleged rights of action under the Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975, 89 Stat. 773, 20 U. S. C. §§ 1232, 1401, 1405, 1406, 1411-1420, 1453, and § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 87 Stat. 394, as amended, 29 U. S. C. § 794. After a lengthy *149trial the District Court issued a “preliminary injunction” requiring the State to conduct additional tests of school grounds to aid in assessment of the school’s seismic safety. Petitioners appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit pursuant to 28 U. S. C. § 1292(a)(1). That court affirmed the issuance of the preliminary injunction on the ground that the lower court had not abused its discretion. 736 F. 2d 538 (1984). The court expressly noted that it was not finally deciding the merits of the action, but only was assessing the District Court’s reasoning to determine whether it had appropriately applied the traditional calculus for granting or denying preliminary injunctions. Id., at 542-543, 546-547, 550.
Petitioners have petitioned this Court for a writ of cer-tiorari to review the judgment of the Ninth Circuit, but in the meantime the tests ordered by the District Court’s preliminary injunction have been completed. We therefore are confronted with a situation nearly identical to that addressed in University of Texas v. Camenisch, 451 U. S. 390 (1981), in which the petitioners had completely complied with the terms of a preliminary injunction by the time the case reached this Court. In Camenisch we concluded that “the question whether a preliminary injunction should have been issued here is moot, because the terms of the injunction . . . have been fully and irrevocably carried out.” Id., at 398. Because only that aspect of the lawsuit was moot, however, we merely vacated the judgment of the Court of Appeals, and remanded the case for further proceedings. Ibid. Here, as in Camenisch, the only question of law actually ruled on by the Court of Appeals was whether the District Court abused its discretion in applying the complicated calculus for determining whether the preliminary injunction should have issued, an issue now moot. No order of this Court could affect the parties’ rights with respect to the injunction we are called upon to review. Other claims for relief, however, still remain to be resolved by the District Court. We accordingly *150grant the petition for writ of certiorari, and vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals, with instructions to remand the case to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

Mr. Justice Murphy,
dissenting:
Mr. Justice Black, Mr. Justice Douglas and I cannot agree with the opinion of the Court. Section 75 (n) subjects to the exclusive jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court all property in which the petitioning farmer-debtor has any equity or right, “including, among others . . . the right or the equity of redemption where the period of redemption has not or had not expired, ... or where deed had not been delivered, at the time of filing the petition.” Conceding that respondents’ equity of redemption was cut off under Indiana law prior to the filing of their petition, the deed had not been delivered at the time of filing. Respondents thus come within the exact terms of § 75 (n), and the property should not have been struck from their schedules.
We have said that doubts in § 75 are to be settled in the debtor’s favor, and that it “must be liberally construed to give the debtor the full measure of. the relief afforded by Congress, lest its benefits be frittered away by narrow formalistic interpretations which disregard the spirit.and the letter of. the Act.” Wright v. Union Central Ins. Co., 311 U. S. 273, 279. But we are now told that the spirit and the letter of § 75 (n),-especially the phrase-“or where deed had-not been delivered,” -may be disregarded upon a *143“fair reading of the entire section” and a consideration of its legislative history, both of which, it is claimed, disclose that Congress did not intend the benefits of § 75 to extend beyond the expiration of the equity of redemption by force of state law, the above-quoted phrase being added, “apparently out of an excess of caution,” to provide for those states in which the equity of redemption survives until the delivery of a deed. If Congress so intended, its words were poorly chosen. Congress could easily have declared that bankruptcy jurisdiction does not survive the ex-tinguishment of the equity of redemption under state law, whether that extinguishment is accomplished by sale, confirmation, or the delivery of a deed. Instead Congress used the disjunctive “or”. That Congress did not so intend is clear from the legislative history of the Act. The true Congressional purpose was “to protect the farmer’s home and property, and at the same time to protect the creditor.” 1 This purpose is best achieved by giving effect to the precise words of § 75 (n). The farmer is given a chance to rehabilitate himself so long as he has any vestige of a right in the property, call it “bare legal title” or what you will. The creditor is protected because the value of the property remains, under adequate safeguards provided by the Act, as security for the debt. “There is no constitutional claim of the creditor to more than that.” Wright v. Union Central Ins. Co., 311 U. S. 273, 278.

This case is important because it shows that there is a fundamental conflict between authority and right. It is clear that the State asserts its power to conditionaccess to public education upon making a sign and profession but at the sametime coerce attendance by punishing either parent or child. Thus, the question is whether officials will be able to force an individual to swear his own belief or engage in a ceremony without believing him. If they do not believe him, however, then they may be unable to enforce the law. Therefore, the First Amendment does not allow official authorities to censor or suppress expression of opinion.

1630,9419380,103870,040dissent,"In this paper, Justice Frankfurter defends the Constitution's due process clause as a guarantee of good citizenship. He asserts that it is not necessary for a judge to decide whether a state or an individual can violate the rights of the people by making laws that violate their consciences. The Court does not have power to nullize legislation in cases where there is a specific provision of the constitution which prohibits certain kinds of government from doing so. However, when Congress attempts to pass laws that are inconsistent with the ""spirit"" of the Constitution and do not conform to the constitutional provisions, the court cannot be allowed to do so. It is important to note that the First Amendment provides for legislative powers to be granted to the courts only when they are asked to make decisions on behalf of the public good. This means that even if legislatures try to pass law that violates religious beliefs, they cannot be prevented from doing such things. If one believes that religion is outside the political system, then his actions may be harmful to the nation. Therefore, any act that promotes good citizenship must be within the jurisdiction of the federal government. A person may believe what she pleases but should not obey a law that contradicts his religious beliefs. Thus, a person may exercise his religion freely but refuses to comply with a particular law because of his conscience. Finally, he denies the right to require all students to attend public colleges. Although some critics claim that these schools offend religious freedom, the Supreme Court has consistently held that school curriculates violate the Due Purity Clause. Furthermore, many states have refused to allow parents to send their children into private schools because of religious concerns.

Me. Justice Douglas,
with whom Me. Justice Murphy concurs, dissenting:
My disagreement with the majority of the Court is on a narrow ground. I agree that the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment should not be distorted to make the federal courts the supervisor of the state elec*18tions. That would place the federal judiciary in a position “to supervise and review the political administration of a state government by its own officials and through its own courts” (Wilson v. North Carolina, 169 U. S. 586, 596)— matters on which each State has the final say. I also agree that a candidate for public office is not denied the equal protection of the law in the constitutional sense merely because he is the victim of unlawful administration of a state election law. I believe, as the opinion of the Court indicates, that a denial of equal protection of the laws requires an invidious, purposeful discrimination. But I depart from the majority when it denies Snowden the opportunity of showing that he was in fact the victim of such discriminatory action. His complaint seems to me to be adequate to raise the issue. He charges a conspiracy to wilfully, maliciously and arbitrarily refuse to designate him as one of the nominees of the Republican party, that such action was an “unequal” administration of the Illinois law and a denial to him of the equal protection of the laws, and that the conspiracy had that purpose. While the complaint could have drawn the issue more sharply, I think it defines it sufficiently to survive the motion to dismiss.
No doubt unconstitutional discriminations against a class, such as those which we have recently condemned in Lane v. Wilson, 307 U. S. 268, and Skinner v. Oklahoma, 316 U. S. 535, may be more readily established than a discrimination against an individual per se. But though the proof is exacting, the latter may be shown as in Cochran v. Kansas, 316 U. S. 255, where a prisoner was prevented from perfecting an appeal. The criteria are the same whether one has been denied the opportunity to be a candidate for public office, to enter private business, or to have the protection of the courts. If the law is “applied and administered by public authority with an evil eye and an unequal *19hand, so as practically to make unjust and illegal discriminations between persons in similar circumstances” (Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U. S. 356, 373-374), it is the same as if the invidious discrimination were incorporated in the law itself. If the action of the Illinois Board in effect were the same as an Illinois law that Snowden could not run for office, it would run afoul of the equal protection clause whether that discrimination were based on the fact that Snowden was a Negro, Catholic, Presbyterian, Free Mason, or had some other characteristic or belief which the authorities did not like. Snowden should be allowed the opportunity to make that showing no matter how thin his chances of success may seem.

In addition, the contract provisions state that in the case of an impassable highway between any two of the railroad stations, the contractor shall notify the railroad immediately so that it may arrange and substitute another service if necessary. The railroad does not operate motor cars either as owner nor under lease or other equivalent arrangement. The terms of the contract stipulate that the motor vehicles must be supplied by these independent contractors and operated according to their directions and control.

The Court is skeptical of this theory because it assumes that Magggio has been tricked into taking possession of the company's property or proceeds after the bankruptcy was final. It also dismisses the contempt orders issued by the Second Court as unjust. Because the court considers the two separate stages of the process to be interdependent, we are concerned that they may not all work together in the same way. The Chapter 11 Bankruptcies act as a sort of legal innovation for the courts to collect and reduce money and distribute their property. The purpose of the Chapter 11 Act is to ensure that the estates belonging to bankrupts are collected and reduced to money so that the trustee can dispose of them. The law does not explicitly create a turnover procedure but instead allows the court to administer the estate through its own collection procedures. The term ""purpose"" means that the debtor will have to pay back his debts. The terms of the chapter 11 include: 1) fine or imprisonment; 2) criminal contempt; and 3) punishment for disobeyment of a Lawful Order. This section deals with the question of whether the court should issue a new order when there is no present ability to produce goods or proceeds. If the evidence supports the previous order, then the court cannot deny the fact that the former owner still has the property. But if the facts support the earlier order, the court can find out where the past possession came from. Thus, even if one had taken possession of something before the bankruptcy, such as some kind of book of account, it might not be appropriate to use the proceeds to repay the debt. Therefore, the only thing the court needs to look at is whether the prior order actually exists. That is, until the person who made the order turns over the property to the other party. When the order becomes final, however, the case doesn't need to be reconsidered again.

If the bankrupt does not comply with the orders, then the court cannot go back and forth on whether or not he actually had the goods. Therefore, the question here is whether the Bankrupt meets his burden of producing evidence so as to prevent the court from ordering him to obey the orders. The only evidence available is proof that Maggio could not perform the order because he believes that the order presumptuously assumes that the banks were in possession at the time they were ordered to turn over their goods.

Me. Justice Harlan,
concurring.
Both the terms of the statute, and the fact that two courts of such special expertise in tax matters as the Tax Court and Court of Claims have sustained the taxpayer’s position,1 leave me doubtful as to whether, under the statutory provisions in question,2 the War Production Board had the right to issue partial certificates. The Court finds ambiguity in the statute, but, in resolving that ambiguity as it has, does little more than point out *312that Congress did not interfere with the authority claimed by the Board.
However, in my view the scope of the Board’s powers need not be reached in this case, because, for the reasons given by Judge Lumbard in his opinion for the unanimous Court of Appeals in Commissioner v. National Lead Co., 230 F. 2d 161, I think it clear that respondent cannot maintain the present action. On that basis I join in the Court’s decision.

 National Lead Co. v. Commissioner, 23 T. C. 988; Allen-Bradley Co. v. United States, 134 Ct. Cl. 800.


 26 U. S. C. § 124 (f)(1), from which the Court quotes, must be read in context with 26 U. S. C. §§ 124 (e) (1) and 124(f) (3). Together these sections provide:
§124 (e)(1). “As used in this section, the term ‘emergency facility’ means any facility, land, building, machinery, or equipment, or part thereof, the construction, reconstruction, erection, installation, or acquisition of which was completed after December 31, 1939, and *312with respect to which a certificate under subsection (f) has been made. . . .”
§ 124 (f). “In determining, for the purposes of subsection (a) . . . the adjusted basis of an emergency facility—
“(1) There shall be included only so much of the amount otherwise constituting such adjusted basis as is properly attributable to such construction, reconstruction, erection, installation, or acquisition after December 31, 1939, as either the Secretary of War or the Secretary of the Navy has certified as necessary in the interest of national defense during the emergency period, which certification shall be under such regulations as may be prescribed from time to time by the Secretary of War and the Secretary of the Navy, with the approval of the President.”
§ 124 (f) (3). . . In no event and notwithstanding any of the other provisions of this section, no amortization deduction shall be allowed in respect of any emergency facility for any taxable year—
“(C) unless a certificate in respect thereof under paragragh (1) shall have been made (i) prior to the filing of the taxpayer’s return for such taxable year, or prior to the making of an election ... to take the amortization deduction, or (ii) before December 1, 1941, whichever is later . . . .”

In return for these terms, each distributor is obliged to maintain an exclusive number of Whitetrucks in his or her territory.

Furthermore, the company cannot allow any other manufacturer or distributor to enter into this territory and scalping the market for white trucks therein.

Although the bankrupt had not paid federal income taxes or social security taxes during the period leading up to the bankruptcy, the tax was still due. The United States claimed the government's claim for principal of the payments but disaloned the claims for penalty and interest.

In this case, the Court examines the provisions of the Constitution prohibiting any school district from engaging in ""discriminating motive or intent"" in its hiring, promotion and assignment of employees. The Court considers the legislative history behind the provision as well as the court's earlier interpretation of the definition of ""disparate-impact"" under the first Clause of 706 d)1B. The House Committee on Labor had originally intended to limit the number of teachers assigned to minority groups but had later decided against it. Congress also recognized that the standard of equality under the second section of the statute was more burdensome than the standard beneath the second clause. Thus, the Senate Committee did not only recognize a distinction among the standards under both clauses but also considered the standard itself as more burdensom to the applicants than the Standard under the Second Clause. This difference is further supported by the historical evidence that some states used demotions/dismissals as appropriate because they were well-documented that such practices led to the wholesale firing at Negro professors. Therefore, the legislature has adopted a strict irrebuttable equal-impact test under the First Clause; however, the Supreme Court does not believe that the Stennis Amendment applies only to escorts into schools where there is an unequally impact standard under the third clause.",1979-11-28,1.0

1752,9427831,110225,030concurrence,"The Court dismisses the petitioner's appeal of class certification as mooted because it does not involve the named plaintiff in the case. Justice Powell dissents, arguing that this is an analogy to United States parole com'n v."" GeraghtY, where the district court refused to grant class certification after four years of lawsuit. The Court finds that respondents retain a ""personal stake"" in sharing the expenses of litigating with members of their putative class; therefore, the only reason for the court to deny class certification is that there is no personal stake involved in the outcome and thus cannot be relied on to make a final decision. In other words, since no class has yet been certified, neither can any party present in the court who seeks relief from the action. Therefore, the court must find mootity in order to ensure that all parties remain interested in the matter. It also recognizes that when a party refuses to accept full relief from a settlement that fully meets his claims, then the court will have no chance to judge whether or not they are entitled to additional relief. Thus, even without evidence against them, courts have always held that a tender of complete relief would eliminate one's stake in the result. However, these cases do not seem to favor either party. Indeed, many federal courts have found that if he fails to accept such a favorable verdict, he loses his stake at the end of the suit. This argument is further supported by the Supreme Court's refusal to grant interlocuatory appeals from denial of Class Certification. Finally, the Court decides to direct a new form of federal class action: lawyers who serve as ""unidentified class representatives"" will serve as class representatives under Rule 23. Although the proposed rule may lead to some difficulties in administering the class actions, the solution seems to be to allow class members to appeal directly from the dedenying of class recognition.",1980-05-12,2.0

Although the District Court finds no breach of Petitioners' duty of fair representative, it does not address the merits on Petitioner's claim. It concludes that there are tensions between national labor policy and collective bargaining when an employee's rights are subject to contract dispute resolution procedures. For example, Congress has passed the Fair Labor Standard Act of 1938 to protect all workers from sub standard wages and oppression working hours. However, because Congress has granted individual employees access to courts, the Federal Court will not be able to deny Floret's right to seek relief through arbitral proceedings. Furthermore, since the Constitution allows individuals to bring their wages and hour claims directly to the courts without exhaustion requirements or other formal barriers set up, these rights do not fall outside the scope of any collective bargain agreement.

Instead, Congress favors grievance procedures as a way to resolve small-scale wage disputes.

For example, a driver's time spent inspecting a vehicle prior to going to work may be considered compensable time under the Civil Right Act.

These companies are entitled to one percent of the gross premiums from their domestic company but cannot reduce it to the same amount paid by other domestic companies. After hearing appeals against the constitution, the court decides that the statute is constitutional because it serves at least two purposes: 1) encouraging the creation of new insurance businesses in Alabama; and 2) encouraging capital invested by foreign insurance corporations in the Alabama property and governmental security set forth in its statute.

When asked, the judges are free to strike jurors whom they believe will be incapable of making a well-planned and well-rehearsed defense of the accused.

He believes that the court misses this point in Garmon because it assumes that courts will make a decision on whether an action is ""essentially protected or prohibited."" In order to do so, the court must first determine whether the activity is actually protected or forbidden. If the activity falls within one of these two broad areas, then the federal law dictates that state courts have jurisdiction over those activities. However, when the question of whether an employee is a union supervisor comes up, the only way to prove that the conduct is indeed protected is to show that there is some sort of dispute between the employer and the union. This case illustrates how difficult it is to find out whether a worker is regarded as a supervisor under the terms of the labor act. It also shows that the task of determining whether an individual is deemed a manager is not easy.

He was arrested under the Houston code of ordinances, ""34-la,"" for ""wilfully and intentionally interrupting"" a City policeman.

The case involves an attempt by the Delaware Valley Citizen's Council for Clean air to obtain a permit from the United States to inspect and maintain vehicle emissions systems within 10 counties in Philadelphia and Pitt County, Pennsylvania. Although the parties entered into consent decrees that required the Commonwealth to comply with the provisions of the act, it failed to implement its program by June 1, 1984. After several months of court work, the plaintiff petitioned for attorney'ses fees and costs. The amount of fee awarded was divided into nine different phases. Each phase involved more than one risk of not paying; the District Court determined the amount according to the risk faced by the plaintiff. When the case is settled, the lawyer assumes the risk of being paid but does not have to adjust the fee. If the case fails, the attorney cannot be paid because there is no time or effort to pay his fee. Finally, when the case involves public importance, delay must be recognized as a factor of public importance. A case may involve issues of public significance, such as the plaintiff's position is ""unpopular in the communities"" or that the defendant is difficult enough to determine whether the risk should be compensationd. However, courts have allowed an upward adjustment on the fee after the risk has been taken into account. Some writers have advocated increasing the fee so as to compensate lawyers for their risk of losing. They argue that judges must retroactiveally calculate the chances of winning against the party who prevails. This creates ambiguity between the judge and the lawyer. For example, a litigious party might expect full compensation only for successful efforts at one case, while another lawsuit might result in loss due to other cases. These cases are particularly important because they do not present any new issues. Congress did not explicitly authorize multipliers or improvements for calculating the cost of fee. Thus, we are not convinced that Congress intended to increase the fee to reflect how much risk the case presents. We believe that the risks of losing are too great for an attorney to take without risk enhancement. Therefore, the court doubled the hourly fee for certain periods of the work. It is believed that these cases will lead to greater expenses for lawyers who lose clients.

The court determined that the evidence in the case was not so overwhelming because it was not enough to establish Miller's guilt beyond reasonable doubt.

The Court then turns to another case, which involved petitioners for sale of marijuana. They had been given warnings but they did not make any postarrest comments about their involvement on the day of their arrest; therefore, they were not impeached. The Constitution does not allow the use of silence as an impeachable offense. It also does not permit the prosecution to call upon the accused's silence during the entire trial. Thus, no due process violations occurred in this particular case.

The plurality ably articulates the Government’s purpose underlying §405: “Section 405 protects employee ‘whistle-blowers’ by forbidding discharge, discipline, or other forms of discrimination by the employer in response to an employee’s complaining about or refusing to operate motor vehicles that do not meet the applicable safety standards.” Ante, at 258. And the employee himself has substantial interest in not being terminated and in being paid his wages or the remuneration. On the other side of the scale is Roadway’s interest in not having an unsatisfactory employee on the job pending a full evidentiary hearing. That interest, however, is protected by requiring a reasonable cause finding by the Secretary prior to the issuance of his order, by notice of the charges, and by the opportunity for Roadway to present its side of the case. That is the balance struck by the statute, and the Secretary’s regulations and due process require no more, even though in most cases the Secretary may voluntarily reveal the evidence supporting the charge. Given the purpose of § 405, I would not ignore the strong interest the Government may have in particular cases in not turning over the supporting information, including the names of the employees who spoke to the Government and who corroborated Hufstetler’s claims, prior to conducting the full administrative hearing.
Because I believe that withholding the witnesses’ names and statements prior to ordering temporary reinstatement did not violate respondent’s due process rights, I find myself in partial dissent from the plurality’s opinion and judgment.

Although the court recognizes that it is necessary for criminal defendants to have adequate assistance from their lawyer, this case does not meet the standards set forth by the Constitution. It is important for defense lawyers to avoid conflicts of interests because they may affect almost all aspects of the lawyer's preparation and performance. In addition to the fact in which both parties are represented, there is also evidence that neither party has ever been directly involved in the crime. Both sides argue against the same cause of death; however, the court finds that the argument on Stevens' behalf was stronger than the one on Petitioner -- ""the lesser cul pagability argument."" Thus, even though the trial judge had tried to reduce the sentence to life prison as a result of the lower culpacy argument, the jury would have found him guilty under the circumstances. This furthermore makes it difficult for the court to question whether petitioner consented with the knowledge or voluntary consent to the involvement of his attorney in the prosecution. Finally, although the court considers the necessity of psychological examinations in capital sentences, its decision to do so fails to satisfy the court's reasonable professional opinion. Furthermore, the failure to conduct an appropriate psychological examination leads to a situation in which no witnesses can testify against petitioner.

1864,9431132,111957,040dissent,"Justice Powell dissents from Justice Brennan's opinion that counsel failed to adequately present evidence at the trial of Burger. He contends that there was no conflict of interest because two law partners, Ste*800vens and Burger, represented both parties in their separate criminal cases. The court does not believe that counsel did not fully develop and present evidence necessary to convict a serious backward minor; rather, it believes that counsel made an error of judgment in refusing to advance evidence that would raise a significant question whether the death sentence should have been set on a young man who had a mental and emotional maturity beyond his chronological age. In order to prove that counsel's performance was so defective, the court must show that the defendant suffered prejudice because she did not perform as promised. If the prosecution cannot demonstrate that the circumstances leading to the execution were good, then the sentence will be reduced. However, if the facts do not support the sentence, the jury must find fault with the prosecutor for failing to provide sufficient evidence. This is especially important when a youthful person is charged with a capital offense. A judge must determine whether a child or adult is mature enough to serve as a sentencing juror. When a youth is accused of a crime, such as murder, the Court considers the fact that children are less mature than adults. For example, Eddings V. Oklahoma has noted that ""defendants who commit criminal actions that areattributable to some disadvantaged background or to emotional problems may be less morally responsible than those who have no excuse"" .

If the domestic manufacturer does not buy these goods, it will be difficult for the domestic maker to compete with the foreign manufacturer because they would have to purchase the goods at a higher price than the domestic owner has already purchased. Two other situations arise when a company owns a subsidiary in the United State and distributes its goods abroad. A third party buys them abroad and imports them back into the U.S.; thus, the two companies compete on the Gray Market. The Federal Government did do not regulate gray-market businesses until 1922, after Congress passed a bill prohibiting such importations.

If the government were to create a restricted public place, then no speaker challenging the denial of permission would ever be compelled to prove that such a limited publicly venue is a private public place.

For example, if the jail were built with only one cell, then the court could conclude that it was no longer ""equitably"" that the judgment had prospective application.

1917,9432453,112679,040dissent,"In this case, the Court argues that it is necessary for the district court to grant petitioners' requests for amending their consent decree. It is important that the court find a way to justify a request for change without violating the constitutional rights of the parties. The District courts have authority to make changes in consent decrees after a trial because they are often ""more intrusive"" than simple orders directing the prisoners to cease or desist from illegal conduct. However, when the Constitution prohibits double celling at the jail, the court has an obligation to enforce the prohibition. After several years, the sheriff file a motion for a large new jail and a modified consent decree; the court grants the request on April 11th, 1985. Although the Boston city council objects to the modified order, it seems to have been made by an agreement between petitioners and responders. The new jail is completed in substantial conformity with the termsof the consent decree as modified and renewed in 1985. This paper discusses some of the key provisions of the consent Decree, which were originally intended to serve only two purposes: 1) to prevent double cellation and 2) to reduce the delay in building the new jail. These provisions were specifically designed to fulfill these purposes. Petitioner appeals to the court to alter the consent deceit so that the increase in the population of pretrial prisons will not be detrimental to the purpose of improving the overall quality of the jail.",1992-01-15,1.0

The Dewsunups loaned Aletha and her husband $116,000 in order to pay off their debt. They had agreed to sell the property at a pre-bankruptcy sale so that they would not have to go through with the bankruptcy proceedings. However, before the bankruptcies could take place, petitioner tried to reorganize under Chapter 11 but was dismissed as soon as the bankruptcy was over. Before the bankruptcy went forward, however, Petitioner filed an adversary proceeding against the Bankruptic Court for the district of Utah seeking to ""avoid"" part of the creditors' liens. Because the court did not want to reduce the entire amount of the debt because it was not an ""allowed secure claim,"" the court refused to grant relief. Instead, the court decided that the only portion of the remaining $3,000 was not allowed secured claim within the meaningof 506, which means that there was no way the debtor could void his liens until the actual value of the mortgaged property was equal to the fair market price of the property. Thus, even though the deed has been abandoned by its owner, the estate cannot be voided by the bankruptcy trustee. Finally, the parties argue that the words ""alarmed secured claim"" need not be used as an idiovisible term of law; rather, the words must be read termby term to refer to all claims that are, first, let, and second, secured",1992-01-15,1.0

The Court believes that Congress has correctly understood the meaning of such terms as ""alened secured claim,"" and therefore does not have to read it as an art. However, the Court recognizes that the words ""alone"" and ""alented claim"" are different in the Bank bankruptcy code. It uses the phrase ""alunted claim' to refer to only that portion where the value of real property is sufficient to cover the claimed claim. The United States seeks to prevent invalidation of this portion by focusing on the phrase: ""securement aclaim."" This means that if the creditor holds a lien against property that is worthless, then the entire amount will be subject to avoidage under 506, even if there is some value left over. If the debtor were holding a mortgage on property that was completely worthless but is also inadequate to cover any disallowed claims, the loan would be voides only to the price of the property at the time when the bankruptcy court evaluates it.

A police officer sued on a false arrest could demonstrate good faith in his own ability to make the arrest. However, the court does not recognize a defense or an immunition because the plaintiff seeks only qualified immunity. In other words, even if the officers were entitled to certain general immunity, they may still be entitled to some kind of specific immunity. Therefore, while the Court has no right to grant qualified immunity now, it must consider how best to defend a private party who invoked state attachment law. Thus, as we discussed earlier, courts have often considered whether their decision will result in greater costs needlessly by recognizing an absence of good faith.

This restriction prevents Lucas from building permanently on his land until a decision is made about what uses can be permitted. However, the court finds that Lucas had no final decision on what uses could be permitted under the provisions of the Beachfront Management Act.

He defends the Constitution's prohibition on deportation for aliens who live in or have reached the border of United States territory under Article 243-h. The Constitution does not allow an alien to seek refugee status outside the territorial sea; however, it does provide for some relief when an alien is brought before the Attorney General about his political beliefs or religious beliefs. If the evidence shows that the alien would be threatened by a particular nation because of his politics or religious belief, the attorney general can grant asylum. However, if the proof proves that the foreigner's life or liberty would be endangered in a specific country due to his political or religion beliefs, then the attorney must not send the alien to that country. After 12 years, the program has prevented many immigrants from reaching the shores of the U.S. and repatraating them. On September 30,1991, the military leaders departed the government of Aristide. Following the military coup, the coastguard suspended repatracations for several weeks. Later, the plaintiffs filed a lawsuit against the Government but were granted temporary relief until February 4,92.

However, the majority believes that Congress should have intended to ban the return of any alien on the basis of race, religiousity, nationality and political opinion. This would have been an extraordinary act for the president to take to the ocean to intercept these fleeing immigrants and force their back into his perscutors. The Constitution clearly states that no contracting state will expel or returns a refugeer in any manner whatever to the frontier where his life nor freedom would be threatend on account of her race, religion; nationality, social group, etc. The term ""refoulers,"" as the majority interprets it, means ""to drive back or repel."" It also implies that the government cannot seize or return such a large number of refugees within its territory. The only exception to this prohibition is that if a nation threatened by a foreigner's very presence can ""expel or returned"" a person to an unsafe place, then the nation may do so. The fact that the Netherlands' delegate made this statement at the convention doesn't change the meaning of what the treaty says. Van Boeteszelaer comments that the Convention applies only to people who are already in the territory but don't want to cross the border.

In particular, the Court rejects Buckley's argument that an absolute immunity applies only to ""the commencement of prosecution and to conduct entering the courtroom."" It is clear that this approach would lead to dismal protection for prosecutors because all decisions to begin a prosecution are predicated upon out-ofcourt conduct. Therefore, it is necessary for the prosecutor not only to prepare for trial but also to consult with witnesses before making a final decision about whether or not to indict a criminal. Thus, Imbler was designed to avoid such situations. The Court disagrees with Buckley: ""A prosecutor neither should consider himself, an advocate prior to he has potential cause to have anybody arrested."" This means that if a magistrate makes a third party decide that a suspect must be innocent, then the magistrate cannot dismiss the civil plaintiff's claims against the prosecuting officer. Furthermore, there is no reason why a lawyer can make a false confession during a trial without being subjected to absolute immunity; therefore, the court does not question Burns's conclusion that absolute immunity attaches to a proctor's conduct before going to trial.

It claims that the different standards regarding proof and the rights of immediate family member and guardians do not violate the equal protection clause or the due procession Clause. However, it does argue that rational basis review should be applied when evaluating the merits of the different treatment options available to the mentally-retarded and the physically disabled.

Specifically, the General House has proposed a plan that includes one majority black district in the state. The AttorneyGeneral objects to the plan because it contains irregularly drawn boundary lines; however, the general assembly creates two majority black districts in the north central region along Interstate85. Although the General Assembly does not object to this plan, many North Carolians do bring suit against the state and federal officials. They claim that the legislature intentionally created two Congressional districts with a minority of black voters concentrated arbitrarilly without regard for any other consideration such as compactity, contigiousness, geographical borders, or political divisions. The court dismisses their claims under the Equal protection clause. It finds no support for the claim that race-consciously redistrictting is prohibited by article I, r. 4, Article I,2, or by the privilegesand immunity clause of the Four fourteenth Amendment. However, the Court recognizes that ""race-conscious redisstricting is unconstitutionality"" only when the state uses traditional districting principle like compactness and conformity. In addition, the Supreme Court considers the use of voting machines designed to reduce or cancel out minority voters' ability to cast a ballot.

The court does not overrule the decision but instead sidesteps UJO by ""glowing over the striking similarities, focusing upon surface differences."" It is clear that the state's plans are intended to segregates minority voters and reduce the voting power for whites. However, the majority believes that the plan should not be limited to such odd shapes as the new district has been created. This paper also discusses the constitutional rights of states to impose certain devices or procedures on their citizens who do not have the right to cast a vote. For example, the Supreme Court has held that two kinds of state voting laws can give rise to claims of unconscional discrimination under the Equal Protection clause. One involves direct deprivations of the Right to Vote; the other involves affects political strength of different groups in violation of equal protection. These cases include White v Regester at 766, which asserts that African Americans had less opportunity to participate in elections than did other people. Finally, the question of whether a group has been unfairly denied access to politics is addressed. Although there are many cases where these claims were unsuccessful, the most compelling evidence against them is UJO. The Court rejects the claim that North Charlotte's rediprehension of blacks was part of reapportioning races across the state. Like New York City, North Carolina fails to prove that its proposed constitution had the purpose nor effect of reducing the votes of black citizens.

1964,9432915,112920,020lead,"In this paper, we examine the constitutional provisions governing military judges. Weiss pleads guilty in a courtmartial and two other petitioners appeal to the Court of Militating Appeals. The Court finds that Congress has appointed military judges as  commission officers without fulfilling the due process clause. However, the courts have rejected Petitioner's due process challenge because they do not have an adequate term of office to fulfill the Appositions Clause. They also reject Petitionor's Appointment Clause challenge because it does not involve a fixed time of office. Although Congress has established several different types of military courts, only one is specifically designated for servicemembers. A general or special court martial can impose punishment over any offense under the Unified Complainance Juice Act; however, there are exceptions to punishing minor offenses with no greater punishment than 6 months of imprisonment, three months hard labor without conviction, partial forfeitures of pay, reduced rank, and dishonorably discharged. There are four courts of military review, each for the Air Force, Navy, Coastguard, and Navy Marine Corps. At the last tier are five civilian judges elected by the President who serve for 15 years. Finally, we discuss the Constitution's Article II section, which states that Congress may by law vest the appointment of inferior Officers ""in the president alone, at the Courtsof Law, or within the heads of departments."" This means that Congress must either re-appoint military judges or else require a third appointment before they become judges. Both parties agree that Congress had intended to create separate offices for military judges but did not want them to be appointed separately. Some critics argue that Congress should have given military judges more authority than other officers since all military judges act as ""officers,"" but both parties disagree on whether such appointments are necessary. For example, Shoemaker was ruled invalid because Congress wanted to increase the powers and duties of existing offices without thereby making it necessary for the new office to be created. Thus, while Congress could create an office through its own force, it cannot choose a particular person to fill the position. Instead, Congress assigns military judges to various positions. These include: commanders, chiefs, naval officers, airmen, captains, superintendents, and so forth. All military judges play a major part in the execution of military justice",1994-01-19,1.0

Justice Breyer,
dissenting.
We must draw a statutory line that either (1) will include within the category of persons authorized to bring suit under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 some whom Congress may not have wanted to protect (those who wear ordinary eyeglasses), or (2) will exclude from the threshold category those whom Congress certainly did want to protect (those who successfully use corrective devices or medicines, such as hearing aids or prostheses or medicine for epilepsy). Faced with this dilemma, the statute’s language, structure, basic purposes, and history require us to choose the former statutory line, as Justice Stevens (whose opinion I join) well explains. I would add that, if the more generous choice of threshold led to too many lawsuits that ultimately proved *514without merit or otherwise drew too much time and attention away from those whom Congress clearly sought to protect, there is a remedy. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), through regulation, might draw finer definitional lines, excluding some of those who wear eyeglasses (say, those with certain vision impairments who readily can find corrective lenses), thereby cabining the overly broad extension of the statute that the majority fears.
The majority questions whether the EEOC could do so, for the majority is uncertain whether the EEOC possesses typical agency regulation-writing authority with respect to the statute’s definitions. See ante, at 479-480. The majority poses this question because the section of the statute, 42 U. S. C. § 12116, that says the EEOC “shall issue regulations” also says these regulations are “to carry out this sub-chapter” (namely, §12111 to §12117, the employment sub-chapter); and the section of the statute that contains the three-pronged definition of “disability” precedes “this sub-chapter,” the employment subehapter, to which § 12116 specifically refers. (Emphasis added.)
Nonetheless, the employment subchapter, i. e., “this sub-chapter,” includes other provisions that use the defined terms, for example a provision that forbids “diseriminat[ing] against a qualified individual with a disability because of the disability.” § 12112(a). The EEOC might elaborate, through regulations, on the meaning of “disability” in this last-mentioned provision, if elaboration is needed in order to “carry out” the substantive provisions of “this subchapter.” An EEOC regulation that elaborated on the meaning of this use of the word “disability” would fall within the scope both of the basic definitional provision and also the substantive provisions of “this” later subchapter, for the word “disability” appears in both places.
There is no reason to befieve that Congress would have wanted to deny the EEOC the power to issue such a regulation, at least if the regulation is consistent with the earlier *515statutory definition and with the relevant interpretations by other enforcement agencies. The physical location of the definitional section seems to reflect only drafting or stylistic, not substantive, objectives. And to pick and choose among which of “this subchapter['s]” words the EEOC has the power to explain would inhibit the development of law that coherently interprets this important statute.

1970,9434608,134744,020lead,"In this case, Justice scales back on the argument that a changing party's citizenship can cure lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The case is a state law suit against a limited partner named Atlas Global G.L.R., who sued a Mexican company called Grupo Da-***569tatflux in the United State District Court for Texas. After three years of trial and discovery, the court dismisses the case because the parties are not diverse at time of the complaint. The Fifth Court disagrees with the Court's interpretation of the general rule: ""An action is brought or removed when Constitution and/or other statutory jurisdiction requirements are not meet."" However, the Court does not apply the general rules to determine whether there is any change of citizenship during the proceeding. It only applies the general Rule and dismissal if it is found that the parties were different at the time they filed the lawsuit. This decision has long been used as an example of how courts must govern cases involving multiple citizens. For instance, Anderson v Watt, 1891, had two New York executors tried to save jurisdiction after finding that one of them was New York citizen. But the plaintiffs did not have complete diversity at their time of removal from the federal court because one of those plaintiffs shared Kansas citizenship with another. When the district court denied reversing the motion to dismiss, the plaintiff settled out of proceedings and was dismissed by the court. The Supreme Court also rejected the Fifth Circuit's opinion that no change of Citizenship could cure the jurisdiction problem. Although the court refused to recognize an additional exception to the Time-of-Filing rule, the dynical dissent points out that such an exception would be unnecessary since all cases involve changes in the partners' identities.",2004-05-17,1.0

This precedent applies to cases when there is a postfilling changes in the parties' identities. For example, two limited partners who are Mexican citizens initially claim that they do not have complete diversity. However, as soon as the trial begins, however, they lose all their claims. At the end of the six day trial, the Court grants Dataflux's motion to dismiss the lawsuit for lack jurisdiction. The district court dismissed the case on the grounds that Liberty Mutual did not settle its claim before Whayne supply became a defendant. The Court reverses the district court's decision and orders the statute of limitation to stay from November 18, 2000 until tendays after the date of the first filing of the case. Newman Green appeals to the Fifth Court, but the Supreme Court disagrees with the Court's interpretation of the Constitution's provision for federal jurisdiction.

The court disagrees with the district court's interpretation of  17,82; however, it does not categorize the assistance requested by AMD as an interested person within 1782-a. It is clear that Congress did not intend to limit the aid provided by the United States government through a foreign law provision. However, we do note that Congress had originally intended to provide for federal court assistance in gathering information for use in international tribunals. This legislation was passed in 1855 and replaced the word ""civil action"" with the phrase ""judicial proceeding."" Congress also added provisions for criminal investigations before formal accusations. Thus, there are no restrictions on discovery made by a federal court. Although the European Commission is responsible for conducting antitrust enforcement under the Articles of Confederation, its primary responsibility is to enforce the treaty.

Finally, although neither party can be designated as an interested person, they have significant procedural right. A complainant who invokes a national or international tribunal has certain rights. For example, he may submit information to the Governing Committee regarding the complaint. He may also seek judicial reviews of the DG Competition's decisions.

  In
  
   Lawrence, et al.
  
  v.
  
   St. Louis-San Francisco Railway Company, supra,
  
  the court said: “ The importance of an opinion to litigants and to this Court in cases of this character was pointed out in
  
   Virginian Ry. Co.
  
  v.
  
   United States,
  
  272 U. S. 658, 675. The importance is even greater where the decree enjoins the enforcement of a. state law or the action of state officials thereunder. For then, the respect due to the State demands that the need for nullifying the action of its legislature or of its executive officials be persuasively shown.”
 

  In the present instance this Court should have the aid of appropriate findings by the District Court of the facts which underlie its conclusions.
 

  The decree is set aside, and the cause is remanded to the District Court, specially constituted as provided by the statute, to state its findings of fact and conclusions of law and enter a decree thereon, the restraining order entered in this suit to be continued pending further action by the District Court.

  Mr. Justice Butler
 

  delivered the opinion of the Court.
 

  Respondent was a seaman employed as a fireman on the American steamship Alpha navigating the high seas. The corporation petitioner owned and operated the vessel and the other petitioners were in possession of her. Respondent sued petitioners in the federal court for the Southern District of New York to recover damages for personal injuries caused by an assault upon him by his superior, one Jackson, an assistant engineer in charge of the engine room. The complaint charged and the evidence was sufficient to warrant a finding that Jackson was authorized by defendants to direct plaintiff about his

  work and that, for the purpose of reprimanding him for tardiness and compelling him to work, Jackson struck plaintiff with a wrench and seriously injured him. That was the basis of fact upon which the jury under the charge of the court was authorized to find for plaintiff. The jury returned a verdict in favor of plaintiff for $12,000 and the judgment thereon was affirmed in the Circuit Court of Appeals.
 

  That court expressed the opinion, 35 F. (2d) 717, 721, that § 33 of the Merchant Marine Act, 46 U. S. C., § 688, and the Federal Employers’ Liability Act, 45 U. S. C., §§ 51-59, did not apply and held defendants liable under the general maritime law without regard to these Acts. But in

Mr. Justice'Van Devanter,
Mr. Justice McRey-nolds, Mr. Justice Sutherland and Mr. Justice Butler concur in this disposition of the case, upon the rehearing, for the following reasons: The state court found that the petitioners here “did not make a bona fide effort to make the street railway business a success,” but planned to discontinúe ,it. and pursued a course tend*193ing to depress the business and make it unremunerative; that “ if the street car system had been properly maintained, as it could and should, have been, the same would have been patronized by the public generally”; and that the “ street railway system can be made to yield a fair return if properly managed and properly maintained.” These findings,.although opposed to part of the evidence, have such support in other parts that they should be accepted here. In the presence of such findings, so supported, it is apparent that on the present record petitioners are not in a position to maintain that enforced operation of the street railway system will be in contravention of rights secured by the due process of law clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. An essential basis in matter of fact for the right sought to be asserted under that constitutional provision is wanting; and as this is true regardless of whether the electric street' railway franchise be independent or so unified with other franchises as to be interdependent, there is no present need to consider or determine its status in that regard.

  v.
  
   Swift & Company, ante,
  
  p. 468, controls the decision of this case.
 

  Here the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, upon audit of petitioner’s income and excess-profits tax return for 1918, found an overpayment, and at the same time found an underpayment of similar taxes for the, years 1916 and 1917. On January 22, 1926, he made, additional .assessments of the underpayments for 1916 and 1917;
   
   *480
   
  and on January 29 he approved a schedule of overassess-ments which embraced the overpayment for the year 1918. The schedule was transmitted to the Collector of the. appropriate district with the Usual instructions and authority to check the overassessment against the taxpayer’s account and determine whether the amounts in which the tax liability had been reduced should be abated in whole or in part, and if any part of the overassessment was found to be an overpayment to apply the same against taxes due, if any, making the appropriate entry in his accounts.
 

  After this had occurred, petitioner inquired in writing • of the Collector as to the status of its account. He replied by letter dated February 23, 1926, stating that he had applied the oyerassessment to close out the accounts of 1916 and 1917, thus extinguishing the taxpayer’s liability as shown by his books. On February 27, 1926, he returned the schedule of overassessments to the Commissioner together with the usual subsidiary schedule of credits and refunds showing how he had credited the over-assessment and that there remained a balance of 1918 taxes refundable to the taxpayer amounting to $21,152.12. On April 15, 1926, the Commissioner approved the schedule, thus authorizing the issuance of checks covering the amount to be refunded.
 

  The question is whether interest should be allowed the petitioner under § 1019 of the Revenue Act of 1924 (43 Stat. 346) or under § 1116 of the Revenue Act of 1926 (44 Stat. 119). The latter act took effect February 26, 1926. The Court of Claims held that the act of the Commissioner in approving, the schedule of refunds and credits and authorizing the issuance of checks on April 15, 1926, constituted the allowance of the claim for credit, and that interest on credits for 1916 and 1917 taxes should be calculated under the Act of 1926, which had then become effective'. The petitioner argues that credit was allowed

The first order was issued in December 1926 for an investigation about the use of passenger-traincars, including so called office cars. The second order was entered on July 30,29, amending the regulations governing form and recording passes. The court finds that the practice condemnated by the commission was a subject within its jurisdiction and that, after hearing the carriers, there was no argument as to whether or not the practice was lawful. The district court found that the practices condemned by the commissioner were a matter inside its jurisdiction but that it was not powerless to interfere. In the report before the commission, the returns showed that a considerable portion of the entire miles of private train cars,including so-called offices cars, were on the lines other than those owned the cars. Private cars are often moved without charge; however, these carriages are frequently used for other purposes by railroad officials, their relatives and friends. The courts find that this practice violates the provisions of section 1 and 22 with respect to transportation of passengers. The appellents argue that because the movement of ""private"" cars is not subject to discrimination under the Act, they are not violating the provision regarding free transportation. They contend that the only difference between the charges provided by the carriers provides for certain minimum fare and revenue for the movements of the private automobiles of individuals and corporations other than others who are other carriers. However, the ruling lacks sufficient support. The plaintiffs claim that the move of private cars is unjust because the transportation does not involve any physical movement of the vehicle over another line. The case also rests on the fact that railway officers spend much time traveling over their own lines while working at other railroad companies. This convenience is evident in the factthat many members of the railroad board attend meetings and hearings where the conduct of business is important. Furthermore, even though the travel of private car owners may be considered incidental to such free transportation, the terms of Section 3 do not allow them to give tickets to anyone except the principal officer of railroad companies and his employees. It is furthermore claimed that the transport of a privately owned car is treated as incidental rather than property transported. Thus, the carrier must treat the private car as if it belongs to another company. The conclusion is that when the carriage is being transported solely for revenue purpose, it is handled for revenue reasons in the interest",1931-02-25,2.0

  Mr. Justice Holmes
 

  delivered the opinion of the Court.
 

  The Commissioner of Internal Revenue determined that there was a deficit of $3,378.89 in the petitioner’s income tax for the year 1925 under the Revenue Act of 1924. The petitioner claimed a deduction from income of $22,400 as a bad debt. The deduction was disallowed by the Commissioner, by the Board of Tax Appeals and, in
   
   *141
   
  review, by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. 42 F. (2d) 158. A writ of certiorari was allowed by this Court.
 

  The petitioner’s tax return was on the cash basis. The facts of the transaction concerned were that the petitioner and his partner were joint endorsers of notes issued by a corporation that they had formed. There remained due upon these notes $44,800, that the corporation was unable to pay. In 1925 the petitioner and his partner in settlement of their liability made a joint note for that sum to the bank that held the corporation’s paper, received the old notes, marked paid, and destroyed them. The petitioner claims the right to deduct half that sum as a debt “ ascertained to be worthless and charged off within the taxable year,” under the Revenue Act of 1926, c. 27, § 214 (a) (7); 44 Stat. 9, 27.
 

  It seems to us that the Circuit Court of Appeals sufficiently answered this contention by remarking that the debt was worthless when acquired. There was nothing to charge off. The petitioner treats the case as one of an investment that later turns out to be bad. But in fact it was the satisfaction of an existing obligation of the petitioner, having, it may be, the consequence of a momentary transfer of the old notes to the petitioner in order that they might be destroyed. It is very plain we think that the words of the statute cannot be taken to include a case of that kind. We do not perceive that the case is bettered by the fact that some of the original notes years before were given for property turned over to the corporation by the partnership that-formed it. For the purpose of a return upon a cash basis, there was no loss in 1925. As happily stated by the Board of Tax Appeals, the petitioner “merely exchanged his note under which he was primarily liable for the corporation’s notes under which he was secondarily liable, without any outlay of cash or property having a cash value.” A deduction may be per
   
   *142
   
  missible in the taxable year in which the petitioner pays cash. The petitioner says that it was definitely ascertained in 1925 that the petitioner would sustain the losses in question. So it was, if the petitioner ultimately pays his. note. So was the tax considered in

The only federal matter ruled upon by the court below (District Court of Appeals), and the only one there submitted, arose upon the general demurrer to the Information. Did this adequately set forth an offense for which the defendant could be punished without violating the Fourteenth Amendment?
Section 403a, Penal Code of California, provides—
“Any person who displays a red flag, banner or badge or any flag, badge, banner, or device of any color or form whatever in any public place or in any meeting place or public assembly, or from or on any house, building or window as a sign, symbol or emblem of opposition to organ*371ized government or as an invitation or stimulus, to anarchistic action or as an aid to propaganda that is of a seditious character is guilty of a felony.”
And the Information charged that the plaintiff “did wilfully, unlawfully, and feloniously display a red flag and banner in a public place and a meeting place ás a sign, symbol, and an emblem of opposition to organized government and as an invitation and stimulus t.o anarchistic action and as an aid to propaganda that is and was of a seditious character.”
Below, counsel definitely “ stated that he was satisfied that the instructions [to the jury] were correct, and waived any claim of error on that account.” Accordingly, decision was not requested upon any question arising out of the charge; no such question was decided. The instructions were properly disregarded and are now unimportant.
The sole matter of a federal nature considered by the Court of Appeals was the claim that the provisions of § 403a of the Penal Code were in conflict with the Fourteenth Amendment. It held the statute divisible and that as petitioner stood charged with violating all of the inhibitions therein, some of which were certainly good, the conviction could not be upset even if one paragraph were invalid. The conclusion seems plainly right and, I think, the challenged judgment should be affirmed.

  The trustee in bankruptcy gets the title to all property which has been transferred by the bankrupt in fraud of creditors, or which prior to the petition .he could by any means have transferred, or which, might have been levied upon and sold under judicial process against him. Act of July 1, 1898, c. 541, § 70; U. S. Code, Title 11, § 110. By § 67, Code, Title 11, § 107 (a), claims which for want of record or for other reasons would not have been valid liens as against the claims of the creditors of the bankrupt shall not be liens against his estate. The rights of the trustee by subrogation are to be enforced for the benefit of the estate. The Circuit Courts of Appeals seem generally to agree, as the language of the Bankruptcy Act appears to us to imply very plainly, that what thus is recovered for the benefit of the estate is to be distributed in “ dividends of an equal percentum on all allowed claims, except such as have priority or are secured.” Bankruptcy Act, § 65, Code, Title 11, § 105.

Furthermore, the agreement did not involve any attempt to change ownership of the company assets or the management of it. It was Leininger's interest that produced the income. The only argument against the assignment of half of the partnership's gross income to his wife does not concern her. Instead, she agrees to make good upon the losses incurred by her husband as a result of his involvement in the enterprise. The statute dealing with partners as such deals explicitly with their liability. Thus, the Congress could impose taxes directly on the partnership but would not allow those who earned the money to escape the taxation by contracting to prevent the payment of the salary and other expenses.

The plaintiffs appeal to the district court of appeal for an order prohibiting them from using any amount of naturally-produced natural gas as is reasonably necessary to produces oil therefrom without exceeding a certain proportion to each well.

  The facts are agreed. The plaintiff has a trunk line of pipe extending from gas fields in Louisiana through Mississippi and back to Louisiana; 72.42 miles having a diameter of 22 inches, 8.11 miles having a diameter of 12 inches and 4.99 miles a diameter of 10 inches. It sells daily to distributors in Louisiana about 70,000,000 cubic feet of natural gas in summer and'about 75,000,000 feet in winter. In Mississippi it sells as will be explained from 204,000 to 520,000 feet according to the season. The gas flows continuously from the gas fields in Louisiana and obviously, for much the greater part at least, in interstate commerce. But the appellants rely upon business done under two' similar contracts made in New York to show that there was intrastate commerce in Mississippi that may be taxed without burdening the main activity that the State cannot touch.

This result causes the plaintiff to pay more than he should have been since he was previously liable for debts.

The.'Secretary of State, invoking the provisions of Article I, section 4, of the Constitution of the United States, and those of the Act of Congress of August 8, 1911, c. 5, 37 Stat. 13, and also the requirements of the constitution of the State in relation to the enactment of laws, alleged that the concurrent resolution in question was ineffective, as it had not been submitted to the Governor for approval and had not been approved by him. The Court of Appeals of the State, construing the Federal constitutional provision as contemplating the exercise of the lawmaking power, sustained the respondent’s defense and affirmed the decision of the lower courts refusing the writ. 258 N. Y. 292; 179 N. E. 705. This Court granted a writ of certiorari.

Three interveners claimed ownership of the automobiles, but none of them had notice of the improper use or intended illegal uses of the car. They appealed against the judgment roll by the government, asking whether the provisions of section 26 of the national prohibition act apply when the driver is caught driving intoxicating liquids across the border. The court answers these questions as follows: 1) Does Section 26 repeal by imply and render inoperable in liquor importations and transportation cases? 2) Does the mandatory provision of Section 26 apply when it is discovered that each automobile has been engaged in mucking dutiably merchandise into the US in violation of customs laws therein? 3) Is the records in the criminal trial wherein the defendant pleaded innocent of violating any customs law admissible under the separate forfeitures proceedings whereinthe intervener is not the only party appearance, for the purposes of showing unlawful Importation by the motorcar or for other purpose? The answer to the first question, ""Do Section 26 of title II of the federal prohibition act repealby implication and rendering inoperaculature in liquor importation and transportation lawsuits?"" responds directly to the second question, asks whether the authorities can arrest the driver without paying duty and then forfeit the automobile.

  delivered the opinion of the Court.
 

  Three corporations, Planters Cotton Oil Co., Inc., Waxahachie, Planters Cotton Oil Co., Inc., Ennis, and Farmers Gins, Inc., were organized under the laws of Texas in August and September, 1924. Two joint stock associations, Planters Cotton Oil Company, Waxahachie, and Planters Cotton Oil Company, Ennis, which had been organized in earlier years, retained their separate existence. One man, H. N. Chapman, was the owner of 98% of the shares of the unincorporated associations. He caused the assets of those associations, or substantially all of them, to be transferred to the newly organized corporations, and received in return substantially all the shares of stock.
 

  For the fiscal year ending June 30, 1925, the three corporations and the two joint stock associations filed a consolidated income tax return wherein the corporations, which had earned a net income of $147,636.25, claimed a deduction of $78,399.25 for loss suffered by the associations during the year preceding the affiliation. The deduction was disallowed, and suit was brought by the corporation and the associations for the refund of the tax to the extent of the overpayment claimed. The District Court dismissed the petition, 47 F. (2d) 659; the Court of Appeals affirmed, 53 F. (2d) 825; and by certiorari the case is here. .
 

  The controversy is ruled by our judgment in
  
   Woolford Realty Co.
  
  v.
  
   Rose, ante,
  
  p. 319, unless the fact that in this case one shareholder, Chapman, was the owner of substantially all the shares of the five affiliated companies supplies an essential element of difference. We think it does not. Chapman was free, if he desired, to continue to do business in an unincorporated form. Preferring the
   
   *334
   
  privileges of corporate organization, he brought into being three corporations and did business through them. These corporations are not identical with the unincorporated associations to whose principal assets they have succeeded, and the losses of the associations suffered in an earlier year are not the losses of the corporations that came into existence afterwards.

The Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Van Devanter, and Mr. Justice Cardozo,
dissenting.
We are of the opinion that the courts of the District of Columbia, as this court has repeatedly declared, are *552not courts established under § 1 of Article III of the Constitution, but are established under the broad authority conferred upon the Congress for the government of the District of Columbia by paragraph 17 of § 8 of Article I. Hence, the limitations, imposed by § 1 of Article III, with respect to tenure and compensation, are not applicable to judges of /these courts. The special authority conferred for the. government of the District of Columbia necessarily includes the power to establish courts deemed to be appropriate for the District (Kendall v. United States, 12 Pet. 524, 619), including the power'to fix and alter tenure and compensation. It is a power complete in itself and derives nothing from § 1 of Article III. It is' a ..power not less complete, but essentially the same as that which is conferred upon the Qongress for the government, of territories. American Insurance Co. v. Canter, 1 Pet. 511, 546; McAllister v. United States, 141 U.S. 174. It is not a dual power in the sense that it is derived, from two sources, that is, both from Article III and also from the constitutional provision for the government of the District, but is dual only in the sense that the latter provision confers an authority so broad that it enables the Congress to invest the courts of the District not only with jurisdiction and powers analogous to those of federal courts within the States but also with jurisdiction and powers analogous to those which States may vest in their own courts. As the courts of the District do not rest for their creation .on § 1 of Article III, their creation is not subject to any of the limitations of that provision. Nor would those limitations, if considered to be applicable, be susceptible of division so that some might be deemed obligatory and others might be ignored. If the limitations relating to courts established under § 1 of Article III applied to the courts of the District of Columbia, they would necessarily prevent the attaching to the latter courts of jurisdiction and powers of an adminis*553txative sort. It is only because the Congress, in establishing the courts of the District of Columbia, is free from the limitations imposed by § 1 of Article III that administrative powers can be, and are, conferred upon them.

2332,9418781,102116,020lead,"Justice Roberts defends the Texas Carload Commodation Act of 1932. The plaintiffs appeal to the commission that their carload cargo rates are unreasonable and preferential to New Orleans. Both carriers file bills in the district court, enjoinning the enforcement of these orders except for so far as one exempts them from finding preference or prejudice. The order does not prohibit any carrier from making or giving any unjust or unreasonable preference nor advantage to anyone particular person, firm, company, corporation, locality or any particular descriptions of traffic; in any respect whatever, or subject any particular persons, company's firm, corporations, or localness, or any specific description of traffic shall be subjected to any unduly favor or prejudice in any regard whatsoever. The complaint is twofold: first, the plaintiffs claim that the ports are not localties preferred or prejudiced by the terms of the Act because they do not pass through with their own rail lines; second, the complainants assert that the acts of the carriers on both sides violate Article I section 9 of the Constitution which prohibits ""any regulation of commerce providing preference to ports of one state over those of other."" The parties agree upon authority for the orders to be found in Chapter 3 of the Federalist Papers. They argue that the railroads may adjust their prices within the reasonableness prescribed by the Act but that such actions do not amount to unequal discrimination. In contrast, the act allows carriers to adjust their rates directly to competitors without having to resort to unfair competition. Although Congress did not intended to forbid this practice, it was believed that there would be no difference in principles between export and import trades routed through Ports. It also recognized that the word ""localities"" could be involved in an act of discrimination when used to denoting origin or destination. However, since the term has been used only to refer to points of origin/destination, the fact that ships can pass through either port or way station makes it seem unlikely that the same kind of traffic will be treated differently at different ports. Finally, the argument against equalization of rate applies to all kinds of traffic including shippers who have paid higher prices to New York and Philadelphia. The Court concludes that although the laws were intended to protect shippers and conignees who would otherwise desire all possible roads for foreignshipments, the orders cannot be justified on any theory that its purpose was protecting merchants and consigneesses.

Wells created five trusts, one number 1, two and three, and two additional ones; all five were irrevocable at the time they were created. The income was to be paid on a life insurance policy for $100 per year. After the death ofthe grantor, any excess income would be accrued until an amount adequate to pay an extra annual premium had already been reserved. In the event of her death, she would receive the remainder of the money as she might want it. All of the other trusts carry out similar plans, except for the use by other beneficiaries. The Grantor makes his returns of his personal income for 1924, 1920, 1926, and 1927, which do not include any portion of the income that the trusts have been applied to payment of taxes. The Commissioner of Internal revenue assesses deficiencies against the extent of the funds used to pay off the insurance policies. The Court of Appeal upholds the Commissioner's assessment but does not allow the creator of such a trust to take his property without an unreasonable assessment. The court furthermore dismisses the taxation of the entire income of thetrusts because there is no difference between its validity in the past and its validity now. It is clear that the government has tried to reduce the burden of taxes on estates through the creation of multiple ownerships. A power-of-revocation was introduced in Congress to prevent evasion from occurring. This device allowed the grantor to ""reverse"" his title to another person who did not belong to the trust. However, the courts have held that these devices are invalid since they violate the rights of the owner. They have also held that certain types of contracts are susceptible of ownership. Life insurance is subject to interruption and forfeiture when the contract is renewed.

All the other notes are subject to interest. The amount of the money left over after the trust is terminated is equal to the sum of the overpaid debts. If the beneficiary were to receive more than the amount actually owed, it would be clear that the burden and benefit were exact equivalents; otherwise, the recipient would have to show that there was a duty on the part of the trustee to collect the money. The California court had approved the payment of the entire amount as long as the remaindermen did not deprive the trustee of any obligation to repay.

After hearing testimony from many witnesses, the court ruled that the practice was unfair and ordered the respondants to cease selling their product under the name "" California white pine"" or ""Pinus Ponderosa."" The orders were dismissed by the Ninth Court. This paper provides an overview of the different types of pine trees in the United States as well as the confusion caused by the confusing names of these trees. The term ""white pine"" has been used for lumber since 1880; however, it is now common knowledge that this term refers to other pine species such as pinus strubus, sugar pine, Idaho white pine, and ponderosea. These terms have become increasingly important in the lumber market because they lead to confusion and confusion among buyers and sellers alike. Many retailers receive orders for wood from customers who mistakenly purchase the inferior product instead of the real product. They also mislead consumers into believing that the products are superior to those sold under the incorrect name. The court found that the wood supplied by the responders is not nearly as good as either the genuine pine nor would sales underneath the wrong namebefitting if it had been. However, the evidence does support the claim that the true pine is superior to the substitute. It furthermore supports the argument that the merchants may have lower their own price so as to pass on the savings to the customer. Finally, even though the manufacturer's name was originally adopted thirty years ago, there is still no evidence that the company made up its mind to use the new name.",1934-01-08,1.0

A Japanese citizen is a ""free white person"" within the definition of citizenship; a Caucasian or African-American naturalization is not allowed. White persons are excluded from naturalization because they are members of one of the Caucassian races. There are exceptions to certain privileges granted by treaties between the U. S. and Japan. For example, a Chinese man may have been born in United States but can still claim his American citizenship under the terms of the treaty. This means that if a foreigner commits a criminal act, it will be easier for him to prove his innocence.

2379,102191,102191,010combined,"In this case, the Court argues that the term ""distribution"" means any kind of distribution made to its members or shareholders out of profits or earnings accumulated since March 1, 19,13. The respondent and petitioner are California stockholders who have been taxed as their respective share of a Dividend paid by the West Side Lumber Company on April 14. 1923. They argue that the company's losses from January 1, 1913 through February 28, 1915 were not considered sufficient to reduce the amount of the surplus left on March 1st because they were charged against the next year's profits. If these expenses were not treated as reductioning the excess of March 1,19 13 but rather charging against the future profits, the company would be free to distribute the remaining portion of the money after the profits had been distributed in order to pay back the previous years' losses. The court disagrees with this theory; it is clear that the actual losses must have been actual. However, the fact that only part of the profit was lost does nothing to alter the question. It is obvious that the companies continued in business during the period between March 1, 1912 and February 28, 1914 so that the total amount of capital held by the company was not reduced. This argument is supported by the Supreme Court's decision in Canfield and Thorsen. The Supreme Court has decided that the Articles of Confederation did not create two separate periods for taxes purposes: one fixed amount and one static amount. Thus, the statute created both periods without changing the results of business activities. The Congress intended to avoid taxation on such a distribution when there were no subsequent losses.",1934-01-15,2.0

The trustees collect royalties from the mine and distribute what remains among the beneficiaries in proportion to their respective interests. The court disagrees with the Commissioner on the claim that each beneficiary has the right to pay back his share of the total depletion; however, the Board ofTax Appeals rejects this argument. The Constitution allows for the deduction of the entire amount of proceeds from a mine without regard to its actual depletions. This is because the statute does not explicitly allow the owner of an economic interest to be burdened by taxes. It also means that the lessor's rights to deplet the property do not depend upon the particular form of ownership held by the moreor. Thus, the lesslor's right to deplete the property does not depend on his retention of any other kind of legal interest therein. Therefore, the only way that the shorteror can make such a payment is by leasing out the land. If the lease was signed before the mine was even started, the longeror could have acquired legal control over the mineral content at the time of the lease. Furthermore, the loweror cannot use his physical possession as a basis for imposing a tax on the whole estate or trust.",1934-01-15,1.0

In 1891, Congress acquired land for naval use and consented by the state to acquire it. This consent was obtained through a state law passed in 1892. At this time, there was no state statute authorizing the heirship or personal representatives who died as a consequence of negligence to keep suit against the rightdoer; instead, the state had adopted a federal insurance law known as the Workmen&s Compensation Act.

The answer is yes. If the judge's salary is increased after his appointment by law, then the judge will be reduced to an amount less than the amount fixed by law before he leaves office. This is because the Constitution prohibits judges from declining their pay during their continual service in office as long as they remain in office without any diminution of their wages. Judges who have served continuously since 1897 are not allowed to decline their pensions under the Articles of Confederation. A judge who wishes to retire can either call upon the senior judge or the chief justice to perform legal duties in another court.

Mr. Justice Stone,
concurring.
I concur in the result.
The statute, in words, authorizes the Commission to grant a hearing as to the reasonableness and lawfulness of the proposed rates and divisions, if complaint is filed, and the Commission has plenary power, upon consideration of the complaint, to postpone the effective date of *465the order and to suspend the rates after the order becomes effective. §§ 15 -(7), 16 (6),’Interstate Commerce Act.
As respondents have failed to invoke these administrative remedies by filing a complaint with the Commission, it seems plain that their rights, constitutional or otherwise, have not been' infringed, and I see no occasion for speculation as to what the statutory duty of the Commission may be in .the event a complaint is filed, or to resort to concessions of counsel in brief and argument to-define that duty, or to suggest that the statute falls short of constitutional requirements if it fails to command the administrative action which it permits. The mere power, unexercised, to withhold constitutional right is not a denial of it. It is enough that respondents have filed no. complaint with the Commission designed to secure a hearing. Before administrative action which respondents may invoke, but have not, it cannot be said that there is any infringement of their constitutional rights to a hearing or to protection from the rates pending a hearing. Compare Pacific Telephone & Telegraph Co. v. Seattle, ante, p. 300; Porter v. Investors Syndicate, 286 U.S. 461, 470, 471.
Further, there is no intimation in the record that upon resort to the administrative remedies which the statute permits any relief to which respondents are justly and equitably .entitled will be Withheld. And there is no contention that the proposed rates will not yield a fair return or that they otherwise infringe constitutional rights. At most it appears that the interest sought to be protected is a prospective share in future traffic which it is feared may be diverted to.the Barge Line, an interest to which the Constitution plainly affords no protection. Edward Hines Trustees v. United States, 263 U.S. 143, 148; Atchison, T. & S. F. Ry. Co. v. United States, 279 U.S. 768, 780; Sprunt & Son v. United States, 281 U.S. 249, *466Thus, regardless of what the statute commands, there is no such showing of threatened ""denial of a hearing or of injury'to a property right as would warrant resort to .the equity powers of a federal court.

I think the judgment should be affirmed.
If “ participation ” means cooperation in the transportar tion, more than is involved in presence on the transporting vehicle with the knowledge that an explosive is being carried, I can perceive no ground for saying that there was participation here. That deceased had made the journey to deliver the caps and, as a “business invitee,” had a right to return on the vehicle on which he had placed it, seems to me as irrelevant as though the deceased had embarked as a passenger on a railroad train on which the explosion occurred after he or his firm had shipped dynamite upon it. By the terms of the policy, participation, to exclude liability, must be at the time of the injury. After the return journey began, deceased did nothing to facilitate the transportation. He neither controlled nor had the right to cor rol it. He was merely present. The distinction drawn between this case and that of mere presence, so difficult of statement and application, appears to me to obscure rather than to,define the meaning of the term and to violate the cardinal principle .that, so far as their language reasonably admits, insurance contracts are to be interpreted most favorably to the insured.

Mr. Justice Van Devanter, Mr. Justice McReynolds, Mr. Justice Butler and I concur unreservedly in the judgment of the court holding the Arkansas statute void as in contravention of the contract impairment clause of the Federal Constitution. We concur thus specially because we are unable to agree with the view set forth in the opinion that the differences between the Arkansas statute and the Minnesota mortgage moratorium law, which was upheld as constitutional in the Blaisdell case, are substantial. On the contrary, we are of opinion that the two statutes are governed by the same principles and the differences found to exist are without significance, so far as the question of constitutionality is concerned. The reasons set forth in the dissenting opinion in the Blaisdell case, and the long line of cases previously decided by this court there cited, fully support this conclusion. We were unable Then, as we are now, to concur in the view that an emergency can ever justify, or, what is really the same thing, can ever furnish an occasion for justifying, a nullification of the constitutional restriction *435upon state power in respect of the impairment of contractual obligations. Acceptance of such a view takes us beyond the fixed and secure boundaries of the fundamental law into a precarious fringe of extraconstitutional territory-in which no real boundaries exist. We reject as unsound and dangerous doctrine, threatening the stability of the deliberately framed and wise provisions of the Constitution, the notion that violations of those provisions may be measured by the length of time they are to continue or the extent of the infraction, and that only those of long duration or of large importance are to be held bad. Such was not the intention of those who framed and adopted that instrument. The power of this court is not to amend but only to expound the Constitution as an agency of the sovereign people who made it and who alone have authority to alter or unmake it. We do not possess the benevolent power to compare and contrast infringements of the Constitution and condemn them when they are long-lived or great or unqualified, and condone them when they are temporary or small or conditioned.

  The petitioner filed a return on May 28, 1918 under the Revenue Act of 1917 for the fiscal year ending March 31, 1918. The Revenue Act of 1918 (40 Stat. 1057) became a law on February 24, 1919, with retroactive provisions as of January 1, 1918. Thereafter the petitioner filed an additional return in accordance with Treasury Decision 2797 (approved March 11, 1919 and quoted in our opinion in Nos. 37 to 39), showing an additional tax of $50,638.75. The Act of 1918 provides (§ 250d) that except in the case of fraud,
  
   “
  
  the amount of tax due under any return shall be determined and assessed by the Commissioner within five years after the return was due or was made.” See also § 250d, Revenue Act of 1921. A deficiency assessment was imposed in May, 1921, which is admitted to have been timely, and another on May 26, 1926, which is contested as too late. There is also a contest in respect of both deficiencies growing out of delay in the collection. True, written waivers were in existence, adequate in form, which extended the date for assessment and collection until December 31, 1926. The taxpayer asserts, however, that they were procured by misrepresentation and signed without authority, and must therefore be ignored.

  In an action to recover the tax paid by the petitioner under the two assessments in controversy, the District Court held (1) that irrespective of any waiver the term of limitation ran from the date of the additional return, and (2) that the waivers were valid and binding. 3 E.

  For the reasons stated in our opinions in Nos. 37 to 39, and in Nos. 35 and 36, the first ruling is erroneous. The second ruling we do not consider, the question of the validity of the waivers being still open for determination in the court below.

  The Court of Appeals of the State of New York reversed an order of the Special Term of the Supreme Court which enjoined the Superintendent of Insurance from making any payments for expenditures incurred in connection with plans of reorganization promulgated under Chapter 745 of the Laws of 1933 relating to guaranteed participating certificates sold by the New York Title and Mortgage Company. The motion for injunction, denied by the Court of Appeals, was made in advance of the promulgation of a plan by the Superintendent of Insurance applicable to the interests of the appellants. Whether, if ,a plan of reorganization is promulgated by the Superintendent of Insurance it will be approved by the Court as required by the statute, or whether, if so approved, it will be opposed by certificate holders, or will receive the assent of the present appellants, or will operate to deprive them of any asserted constitutional right, are matters of conjecture.

  Petitioner brought this .action at law as beneficiary of several policies of insurance issued by respondent. The policies were alleged to have been issued in April, 1932, upon the life of petitioner’s father, who died in July, 1932. The policies were to be incontestable after two
   
   *387
   
  years from date of issue. The action was brought in a state court in Pennsylvania and was removed to the federal court in February, 1933. Respondent’s affidavit of defense set up as new matter that the insured had made false answers and declarations in his application with respect to a surgical operation he had undergone and to the treatment he had received by physicians and at hospitals; that the insured knew that these answers and declarations were false; and that they had been made by the insured
  
   “
  
  fraudulently with the intent of deceiving the defendant into issuing to him the policies of insurance in litigation, when the facts were such that if he had answered said questions truthfully and had made a full and honest disclosure, the defendant would not have issued any of said policies, but would have declined his application.” Respondent tendered judgment for the amount of the premiums received by it, with interest, and prayed that the policies be cancelled. Petitioner replied, denying the allegations of fraud.
 

  Respondent asked that the equitable issue raised by its affidavit of defense should be heard under § 274b of the Judicial Code (28 U. S. C. 398)

  The petitioner contests the validity of a deficiency assessment for 1929 income taxes. It maintains that the transaction out of which the alleged gains arose amounted to a reorganization within the intendment of § 112 (i) (1) (A), Revenue Act, 1928.

  The court below was of opinion that the transaction involved amounted to a sale of the assets and business of the taxpayer. In November, 1929, petitioner transferred what the Board of Tax Appeals seems to have assumed was substantially all of its assets to the Kraft-Phenix Cheese Corporation and received therefor $200,000 in cash and 17,250 shares common stock of the purchaser, then worth possibly thirty dollars per share. After the trans
   
   *391
   
  fer, the taxpayer remained in existence and continued to do business. It also retained assets of undisclosed value, namely, shares of certain subsidiary corporations and some other property. If the claim of the taxpayer that the transfer included substantially all its property is correct, then we think what was done amounted to a reorganization within the statute. The facts in respect of this were not found by the Board of Tax Appeals, and the cause must be returned there in order that the omission may be supplied. The mere fact that the taxpayer and its subsidiaries continued actively in business would not defeat the claim of reorganization. The ownership of the stock in the Kraft-Phenix Cheese Corporation gave the taxpayer a substantial and continuing interest in the affairs of that corporation.
 

  The judgment of the court below is reversed. The cause will be remanded to the Circuit Court of Appeals with direction to that Court to remand the case to the Board of Tax Appeals for determination of the value of the retained assets and such further proceedings as may be necessary.

  Petitioner — Bus and Transport Securities Corporation — challenges a deficiency income tax assessment for 1929, and says that the transaction from which the alleged taxable gain arose was reorganization within § 112, Rev.

  Jacobus owned practically all shares of two corporations, herein designated “A” and
  
   “ B,”
  
  which operated bus lines. The Public Service Corporation of New Jersey— the projector — desired to control these lines; and to that end engineered the following plan.
 

  Public Service Coordinated Transport Company, affiliated with the projector, caused the organization of C. Easman Jacobus, Inc., took all the stock and paid therefor by transfering 2500 of the projector’s shares.
 

  Jacobus caused petitioner to be organized and acquired all its stock in exchange for all shares of “A” and “ B ” corporations. Thereafter petitioner transferred to Public Service Coordinated Transport Company these “A” and “ B ” shares and took all shares of C. Easman Jacobus, Inc.
 

  Thus, petitioner, through Jacobus, Inc., came to control 2500 of the projector’s shares. And Public Service
   
   *393
   
  Coordinated Transport Company became owner of all shares of
  
   “A”
  
  and
  
   “
  
  B ” corporations. Through these manipulations, the projector obtained indirect control of corporations
  
   “A”
  
  and “ B ” and the lines which they operate.
 

  The Commissioner, the Board of Tax Appeals, and the Circuit Court of Appeals all rightly concluded that petitioner was not party to a reorganization within the statute. Certain corporate shares owned by it were exchanged for shares which another corporation owned. Neither party to the exchange acquired any definite immediate interest in the other. Nothing here, we think, even remotely resembles either merger or reorganization as commonly understood.

The purpose of this act is to restore purchasing power to agricultural products at a price that will equal the current average farmer price and give farmers an equal purchasing power. Section 8 allows the Secretary of agriculture to make agreements for reduction of lands or production in order to protect consumers' interest. Section 9 also provides for taxation on any basic agricultural product which must be reduced by contracting with producers or other voluntary methods. In addition, section 9 grants the Secretary authority to issue licenses to permit processors, association of producers and others who engage in interstate trade or foreign commerce. Section 10 authorizes the Secretary to levy a tax as long as it does not exceed the difference between farm prices and fair exchange value. On July 14, 1934, the President proclaims that rental and benefit payment should be made according to cotton. However, the Federal Court reverses the judgment against the millers. The federal government asserts that the law is only a revenue-levying measure intended to raise revenue for support of government; however, the responders are seeking to separate the two parts of the act into two: one levies an excisage on certain commodities and the other approving the public money independently of the original. The Constitution states that the tax cannot be sustained by disregarding the ""avowed Purpose and Operation"" of the Act. The tax acts as part of the plan to regulate American agriculture. It is used to accomplish two things: 1) to help farmers attain parities prices and 2) to aid those who need to reduce their errands during the time required to bring about crop reduction and price raising. The taxes are levied when the Secretary determines that rent or benefit payments shall be made for cutting acreage. If the rate is changed, the merchant may exempt his product. The entire program is to become operational when the national economic crisis ends. The whole revenue raised from the tax is appropriately directed to control agricultural production. Although the petitioners claim that the bill is uncollectible, the court disagrees.

  Appellant is a sub-lessee of lands leased by the State of Louisiana in 1924 to the Terre aux Boeufs Drainage District. The lands had become the property of the State by an adjudication for unpaid taxes of 1911 to 1923.

By á subsequent statute, Act No. 161 of 1934, the. legislature of Louisiana permitted redemption on different and less onerous terms, that is, by the payment, on ah installment basis, of the actual taxes for which the property had been adjudicated to the State. Under that statute, certificates for the redemption of the lands in question were issued by the Register of the State Land Office. Appellant then sought
  
   mandamus
  
  to compel the cancellation of the certificates, upon the ground that the Act of 1934 violated the Constitution of the United States in that the act impaired the obligation of appellant’s contract of lease, deprived appellant of its property without due process of law, and denied to appellant the equal protection of the laws. Judgment against the appellant was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the State. That court decided that there was no impairment of the contract as the clause in the original lease, making it subject to redemption, was “free of ambiguity and without limitation as'to the conditions under'which the properties embraced in the lease might be redeemed or sold, or the price to be paid therefor.”

  p. 216, is one as to the meaning of the words “equity receiverships” in the statute for the reorganization of debtor corporations. Bankruptcy Act, § 77 B (a); 11 U. S. C., § 207 (a).
 

  A mortgagee brought suit against Granada Hotel Corporation in the Superior Court of Cook County, Illinois, to foreclose a second mortgage upon real property of the corporation located in that state. A receiver was appointed to collect the rents and profits. Thereafter a-prior mortgagee, the trustee under a deed of trust' to
   
   *226
   
  secure an issue of bonds, brought suit to foreclose the prior mortgage, and in accordance with the law of Illinois laid claim to the possession of the property as owner after condition broken. In response to.,that claim the state-court made an order discharging the receiver, and directing that the prior mortgagee be let into possession.
 

  While possession was so hele], respondents brought a proceeding under Bankruptcy -Act, § 77 B, contending that the possession of the mortgagee was that of an equity receiver or' at least equivalent thereto. The District Court upheld that contention, denying a motion by petitioners, who had intervened in the proceeding, to dismiss the application, 9 F. Supp. 909; and the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed. 78 F. (2d) 409. A writ of certiorari issued from this court.
 

  An equity receivership within the meaning of the statute does not result from the appointment of a receiver for the .collection of the rents in a suit to foreclose a mortgage.

Mr. Justice McReynolds,
dissenting.
Mr. Justice Van Devanter, Mr. .Justice Sutherland, Mr. Justice Butler and I think the challenged judgment should be reversed.
In Nebbia v. New York, 291 U. S. 502, 539, we stated reasons in support of the conclusion that the New York Milk Control Act of 1933 infringed the due process clause. We adhere to what we there said.
The present cause raises a distinct, although subordinate, question. Assuming that the general price fixing provisions of the Control Act are valid, do the provisions *265which permit other dealers to sell below the minimum price prescribed for appellant deprive it of the equal protection of the laws? The answer should be in the affirmative.
Rational classification, based on substantial differences, is within legislative power. An act which permits dealer. A to sell at less than the price fixed for dealer B obviously denies equality; and in the absence of some adequate reason for different treatment, the enactment' is invalid.
Here appellant differs from favored dealers only in that it possesses a well- advertised brand, while they do not. And solely because of that fact, the-Legislature undertook to handicap it and thus enable others profitably to share the trade. There is no question of unfair trade practices or monopoly.
By fair advertisement' and commendable service, appellant acquired the public’s good will. The purpose is to deprive it of' the right to benefit .by this and thereby aid competitors to secure the business. This is grossly arbitrary and oppressive. ■
To support the legislation, it is said the Legislature believed that a fixed minimum price to stores would not preserve the existing economic method of attaining equality of- opportunity. Apparently, this means that a dealer, who through merit has acquired a good reputation, can be deprived of the consequent benefit in order that another may trade successfully. Thus the statute destroys equality' of opportunity — puts appellant at a disadvantage because of merit.
Merely-because on a given date there were differences in prices under open competition, offers no rational'reason for legislation abolishing competition and perpetuating such differences. The status existing under competitive conditions certainly is not preserved by destroying competition. Formerly, appellant' had the right to adjust prices to meet trade exigencies and thus protect itself *266from loss of business. Now it must stand helpless while adversaries take possession of the field. It may suffer utter ruin solely because of good reputation, honestly acquired.

  These suits were brought to restrain the enforcement of a statute of West Virginia known as the “Chain Store Tax Act,” imposing a graduated license tax upon “stores,” which are defined as including any mercantile establishments “which are owned, operated,' maintained and/or controlled by the same person, firm, corporation, copartnership or association.” Acts of 1933, c. 36.

   Gulf Refining Co.,
  
  295 U. S. 75.
 

  The question, in the case of the Gulf Refining Company, related to 568 filling stations operated under particular arrangements with “Authorized Licensed Dealers.” These arrangements were evidenced by a lease of the premises from the dealer to the company, a. license by the company to the dealer for retail sale of the company’s products on the premises, a contract for sales by the company to the dealer, and various receipts for 'equipment and forms of riders. On considering the terms and effect of these agreements, the District Court, of three judges,
   
   *383
   
  decided that the stations were controlled by the Gulf Refining Company within the meaning of the statute. 11 F. Supp. 425.
 

  ■ In the case of the Ashland Refining Company, the question related to 82 filling stations. The company conceded that by the original leases and agency agreements covering these stations the dealer was made the agent of the company and sold its products on a consignment basis. But the company contended that, before the taxing statute was enacted, the parties had abandoned that arrangement and that the company was selling its products outright to the dealers and was not exercising control over the stations. The modification of the earlier agreements was not in writing, but was shown by a stipulation of facts. The District Court considered the nature, and effect of the stated modification and'decided that the stations were still operated or controlled by' the company within the meaning of the act. 11 F. Supp. 431.

The state law regulates fishing only within the state; there are no restrictions on the movement of fish beyond the three mile limit set forth by the legislature. The act governs only the manufacturing within the State. If the products are consumed within the boundaries of the state nor shipped outside in foreign commerce, those matters with which this act is not involved are matters with whom the act isn't concerned.

  Appellant, a convict, was convicted of the felonious killing of one Alton Leonard, a prison guard, in whose custody appellant was working. The jury fixed his punishment at death. The conviction and sentence were pursuant to §§ 5049 and 5051 of the Virginia Code, 1930, providing, so far as pertinent, as follows:
 

  “§ 5049.. A convict confined in the penitentiary, or in custody of an officer, shall be deemed guilty of felony if he kill, wound, or inflict other bodily injury upon an officer or guard of the penitentiary; . . .”
 

  “§ 5051. A convict guilty of such killing as is mentioned in section five thousand and forty-nine, or of any act therein mentioned, from which death ensues to such officer or guard, shall be punished with death.”
 

  Appellant challenged these provisions as being repugnant to the due process and equal protection clauses

  We take the statute as construed by the state court and applied in the instant case. Appellant defended the killing of Leonard upon the ground of self-defense. The evidence in support of that defense, with all the circumstances of the case, was submitted to the jury under appropriate instructions which recognized the admissibility of the defense under the statute. The trial court, defining with care the right of self-defense, charged the jury that if appellant had acted in the exercise of that right, the jury should find him not guilty. The Supreme Court of Appeals refused to review the judgment upon the ground that it was “plainly right.”

  Prior to its insolvency, the Lonoke County Bank was the duly designated depository for the public funds of Lonoke County, Arkansas. In November, 1934, the County Court entered an order compromising the liability of the sureties on the depository bond. In December, 1934, appellant, a taxpayer of the county, brought this action, in the first count, against the county treasurer and her bondsmen, and in the second count, against the bondsmen for the depository, seeking to recover the amount of public funds on deposit in the bank when it closed.
 

  The defense relied upon A.cts No. 16 and No. 325 of the Acts of Arkansas of 1935. Act No. 16 released county treasurers and their bondsmen from liability where deposited funds had been lost by reason of the insolvency
   
   *37
   
  of the bank and not through defalcation of the county-treasurer. By Act No. 325 similar relief was given to the bondsmen for a county depository. Appellant contended that the legislation impaired the obligation of contracts in violation of Article I § 10, of the Constitution of the United States.
 

  The trial court sustained the plea of the county treasurer and her bondsmen, under Act No. 16, and overruled the plea of the bondsmen for. the depository, and rendered judgment accordingly. On appeal and cross appeal, the Supreme Court of the State affirmed the judgment with respect to the county treasurer and her bondsmen, and reversed the judgment and dismissed the cause with respect to the bondsmen for the depository, construing and sustaining the legislation invoked. The Supreme Court of the State decided that the individual taxpayers had no vested interest in the public funds in question and hence that there was no impairment of the obligation of contracts.

The question of confiscation is whether the legislature has power to make such decisions directly or through an agent.

See the cases collected by Brandéis, J., dissenting, in Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 285 U. S. 393, 407, 408. If the challenged doctrine is to be reconsidered, we are unwilling to approve it.

The court granted petitioners' motion for reexamination of the evidence, but denied their request for a direct verdict. The state supreme court held that assume-of risk is not sufficient to defend a claim under the Jones act because it does not relate to the specific circumstances of the case. However, the court did find that there was evidence that the clutch could not be engaged without the presence of abrace between the decks near the engine; that the brace would prevent the wear of the clutch from disengaging during the operation; and that this delay was the cause of the accident and death. It also found that the absence of the braces prevented the use of levers at the Winch to disengage its clutch so as to stop the drums.

  The petitioners were convicted and sentenced in the District Court under an indictment, the second count of which charged them with conducting the business of wholesale liquor dealers without having paid the special tax imposed by the federal revenue laws.

  was to reenact all such laws in existence when national prohibition became effective, save such as were in direct conflict with any provision of the National Prohibition Act or the Willis-Campbell Act.
  
   5
  
  The statutes taxing the business of conducting a wholesale liquor business and imposing the penalties for so doing without the payment of the tax

   7
  
  The difficulty of paying the excise upon the privilege of carrying on a business which is prohibited does not preclude the prescription of sanctions for non-payment.
  
   8
  
  Petitioners insist it is a contradiction in terms to say the laws of the United States at the same time prohibit and license an occupation. The contention is based on misconception of the nature of the exaction. The United States has not licensed the liquor business but, as is clearly within its power, has laid an

   et seg.,
  
  effective February 27, 1933, the Superintendent of Building and Loan Associations of the State of Ohio took possession of the assets of the above-mentioned associations, respectively, for the purpose of liquidation. The Superintendent sought authority to borrow money from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation to pay off claims alleged to be prior to the shareholders’ claims against such associations and to pledge the assets as security. Appellant shareholders, on behalf of all the shareholders of the respective associations, through their counsel, successfully opposed the Superintendent’s applications. Thereupon appellants filed applications for the allowance of their counsel fees and expenses out of the assets of the associations. The Common Pleas Court of Montgomery County, on motion of the Superintendent, struck these applications from the files upon the ground that under the Ohio statutes the court did not have jurisdiction to consider or allow such fees. Motions for new trial and rehearing were overruled. The Court of Appeals of Montgomery County sustained the ruling of the Court of Common Pleas. Appellants then appealed as of right to the Supreme Court of Ohio and that court dismissed the appeals on the ground that “no debatable constitutional question” was involved. 131 O. S. 330; 2 N. E.

The tax is on income. I am of opinion that the rents received by appellant for the use of real estate in New Jersey may not be included in her taxable income.

New Jersey, in addition to tax on the land measured by its value, may lay a tax upon the income received by the owner for its use. Lake Superior Iron Mines v. Lord, ubi supra.
Appellant’s right to own, or to collect rents in New Jersey for the use of, lands in that State was not given and is not protected by New York law. Neither of these rights is enjoyed in New York or has any relation to appellant’s privilege of residence in, or to the protection of, that State. Ability of taxpayers to pay may be taken into account for apportionment of the tax burdens that it is authorized to impose. But the financial means of those to be taxed cannot be made to generate for the State power to tax lands, or rents -paid for use of lands, beyond its borders. I would exclude the item.

If the petitioner were employed by a public entity under a publicly-franchised public franchise, then his salary would not be subject to federal tax. Instead, he would be forced to pay higher wages as a result of the increase in outlays caused by the tax.

  Acting under Pennsylvania statutes, October 5, 1931, William D. Gordon, Secretary of Banking, (respondent Harr is his successor) closed the Franklin Trust Company, a banking institution in Philadelphia, and took control of its business and assets.
 

  Thereafter in the United States District Court, Eastern District of Pennsylvania, petitioner, a New York corpora
   
   *434
   
  tion, presented a bill against Gordon, setting up an agreement by which it undertook to keep on deposit with the Trust Company a sum specified, and the latter undertook either directly or through correspondent banks to accept deposits of cash, checks, etc., and to forward the proceeds therefrom to petitioner in New York. Also that when closed the Trust Company had in its assets $49,690.17 received under this agreement, and its correspondent banks had on hand deposits likewise acquired amounting to $32,403.26.
 

  The bill prayed for a decree declaring petitioner owner of the $32,403.26 and that a trust existed in its favor in respect of the $49,590.17 deposit; also for general relief. The answer suggested some qualifications of the alleged agreement and denied that there was no adequate remedy at law. Otherwise, the allegations of the bill were generally admitted.
 

  The District Court took jurisdiction of the controversy; held petitioner was not owner of the $32,403.26; also that no ground existed for impressing a trust upon assets because of the $49,590.17 deposit; and dismissed the bill.
 

  The Circuit Court of Appeals concluded the District Court had no jurisdiction and should have dismissed the bill without adjudicating other questions. It accordingly approved the dismissal but directed that the cause be referred to the state court for proper procedure there.

The fact that Texas was not actually the owner when the oil was taken into its custody does not make it impossible for the court to prove that the person who owns the oil has any right to claim it back. It is also not correct that Texas did not own the oil when it was brought into its possession.

Mr. Justice McReynolds,
concurring.
The challenged judgment, I think, should be affirmed upon the theory that subsequent to the enabling amendment of June 25, 1930, both parties recognized an existing obligation to observe the terms of the pledge agreement, and on this understanding maintained the relationship of debtor and creditor. Discussion of other questions seems unnecessary.
Prior to June 25, 1930, the Perry National Bank obtained deposits of public funds by undertaking to hypothecate certain of its assets to secure their payment. This went beyond the corporate power theretofore conferred. Texas & Pacific Ry. Co. v. Pottorff, 291 U. S. 245; Marion v. Sneeden, 291 U. S. 262; Lewis v. Fidelity & Deposit Co., 292 U. S. 559.
The amendment empowered the bank to secure such deposits by a pledge of assets. For more than three months thereafter the securities originally hypothecated were allowed to remain in the keeping of the trustee without suggestion of change in the outstanding agreement. And during that period prior deposits were allowed to remain with the bank. It closed October 18, 1930. Earlier insolvency is not relied upon.
The receiver claims that as the hypothecation was unlawful when made he became entitled to the assets free of lien.
After the amendment the bank had full power to do what it had undertaken to do. For three months it *375accepted the benefits of the agreement and allowed the assets to remain with the trustee. All parties assumed the validity of the arrangement and acted in reliance upon it. The result was the same as if the assets had been repossessed by the bank after June 25, 1930, and again hypothecated under an agreement identical with the original one.

Mr. Justice Butler,
dissenting.
Carter v. Carter Coal Co., 298 U. S. 238, decided that Congress lacks power to regulate terms and conditions of employment of those engaged in local production of commodities sold and about to be shipped in interstate commerce. The circuit court of appeals found two questions for solution. One was whether upon that point the Carter case, in 1936, has been overruled by our decision in 1937 in Labor Board v. Jones & Laughlin, 301 U. S. 1. The second was whether the power extends to cases where only 39% of goods locally produced are shipped in interstate commerce. The court, one judge dissenting, upheld the order. Each of the judges wrote an opinion; two held this Court has overruled the Carter case.
If the decision of the Carter case upon the point stated stands, the Board’s order cannot be upheld. The lower court made its decision depend upon that question. Save authoritatively to decide it here, there was no reason for granting the writ. But the opinion just announced does not refer to the question.
*470In the Jones & Laughlin and companion cases, four dissenting Justices thought the Court then departed from well-established principles followed in the Carter case and quoted (p. 96) a passage from it expounding what it meant by “direct” effect on interstate commerce as distinguished from what is “indirect.” And the dissenting opinion insisted (p. 97) that, under the Carter decision, the facts in those cases did not disclose any direct effect upon interstate commerce, and said: “A more remote and indirect interference with interstate commerce or a more definite invasion of the powers reserved to the states is difficult, if not impossible, to imagine.”
But the dissent failed to elicit from the Court any statement as'to whether it meant to overrule the Carter case. The opinion does not discuss that case. It does, however, contain the following (p. 41): “In the Carter case . .. the Court was of the opinion that the provisions of the statute relating to .production were invalid upon several grounds,—that there was improper delegation of legislative power, and that the requirements not only went beyond any sustainable measure of protection of interstate commerce but were also inconsistent with due process. These [meaning the Schechter and Carter] cases are not controlling here.” The later decisions of this Court involving the power of Congress to deal with labor relations in local production do not refer to the Carter case. At least until this Court definitely overrules that decision, it should be followed.
Upon the authority of that case, I would reverse the order of the circuit court of appeals on the ground that, as applied here, the Act is unconstitutional.

The First Question concerns the very foundation of the action of Administrative Agencies enttrusted by Congress with broad controls over activities which cannot be dealt directly by the legislature. The Constitution requires a ""full hearing,"" or fair hearing, whereby the Secretary can make his decisions on behalf of the public. In this case, the petitioners are asked to give a written summary of their arguments and evidence. They do not provide any further information until they are served with the ordering. The final order does not require a formal hearing; instead, it allows the Secretary to hear all the evidence presented in the brief. However, there is no opportunity for the parties to present their arguments at the hearing. Finally, the Federal Court rejects the claim that the proceeding was not an adversary since it was only a general inquire. It ignores reality. The government responds that some of these agencies will be left without compensation after the rate for their services has been set. Furthermore, the former secretary of agriculture had issued an order making changes in the prices before the date of the order. Because of such changes, the new order must be rehearsed.",1938-04-25,1.0

  Mr. Justice McReynolds
 

  delivered the opinion of the Court.
 

  Appellants, nineteen railroads operating within what is known as Central Territory — Ohio, Indiana, Illinois and Michigan — by their bill filed iii the District Court, Northern District of Illinois, July 22,1936, challenged the validity of two Interstate Commerce Commission orders affecting the rate structure on coke moving into that territory from southern points. Questions in respect of these rates have often been before the Commission. The court made findings of fact upon the evidence and dismissed the bill without opinion.
 

  The first challenged order, dated March 11, 1935, followed an earlier suspension of certain proposed schedules and an investigation. It cancelled these schedules and determined what thereafter would be maximum reasonable rates upon a mileage basis. Subsequently, the proceed
   
   *60
   
  ings having been reopened, this order was modified and reaffirmed. In the circumstances, we think the court below properly declined to pass upon its validity.
 

  The second challenged order, April 30, 1936, followed one entered April 15, 1936, which upon petition and replies reopened the proceedings for reconsideration on the record as it then stood. The later order affirmed former findings that the schedules suspended by the one of March 11, 1935, had not been justified, and prescribed future maximum rates upon a mileage basis. These were lower (some ten per cent.) than those authorized prior to 1935.
 

  Here, counsel specially insist this second order exceeded the jurisdiction of the Commission since it undertook to determine rates concerning which there 'had been, no proper notice or opportunity for hearing. But this contention rests upon an assumed construction of the order not obviously correct. The Commission has not so construed it, nor has that body been asked so to do, or for any further action in respect of it. Another construction brings the- order clearly within the jurisdiction assumed by the Commission. In the circumstances appellants canno.t prevail on this point.
 

  Appellants further urge that the order is -contrary to the weight of the evidence, not supported by substantial evidence, disregards ordinary standards for determining reasonableness of rates, is not supported by necessary findings, and represents a mere attempt to equalize geographical and transportation disadvantages, fortune and opportunities. The findings by the court below we think are adequately supported by the record. They negative these claims and leave no sufficient basis for our interference with the action there taken.

The first issue concerns whether the rate should be confiscatory or unjust. The second issue concerns how the rate was calculated.

It was passed by Congress on December 5, 1933 and became effective on January 1, 1935. The Minnesota Foreign Liquor Act took effect on February 29, 1935. This law prohibited the manufacture and sale of liquor in Minnesota except for brands which had been registered in the United States. The business of Triner Corporation involved selling many brand names of liquors with more than 25 percent of alcohol content. To prevent the Liquour Control Commissioner from interferring with the business as well as to protect the rights of the State officials, the court brought suit against the Minnesota legislature. The lawsuit claimed that the statute ""violated the equality clause"" and violated the constitutional guarantee of equal protection. The court held that the provision is reasonable regulation of drinking traffic because it clearly discriminates between imported liquors and those produced within the state.

2832,9418980,103049,020lead,"In this case, the petitioners seek a declaratory judgment that the tax collected on tickets to athletic games in which students participate constitutes an ""unconsstitutional burden"" upon the state government. The court decides that the exaction does not burden a public function of the state because it produces revenue. It also challenges the petitioner's ability to keep a suit against the collector for collection and substitute as the successor in power. The respondant is a publicly owned public corporation created by Georgia as an instrument of the State having control and manage both the University Athletic Association andthe Georgia School of technology. Athletic contests are conducted under its authority by two companies, the U.G. AthleticAggregate and the Georgiatech Athletic Association. Each ticket shows on its face: the admission price; the amount of money paid for admission; and the total at which each ticket is sold. The university collects the entire amount but refuses to return it. The association appeals to the court to stop collecting the portion of the tax demanded by the collector. The district court dismisses the appeal after finding that the former collector was not privy with the acts of his predecessor. However, Congress has adopted a provision authorizing the new collector to be substituted when he dies or ceases to serve in office. This provision allows the current collector to continue collecting the tax without being subjected to further action from the previous collector. If the question were whether the tax was collected by the patrons of the games who did not pay it, the answer is yes. The bill states that no person could claim refund of the payment made by the purchaser of the tickets since the agent had no interest in paying the tax. The statute does not allow the collector to force a purchase of tickets where the amount collected must belong to the buyer. The owner of the ticket cannot recover the full amount due to the sale of tickets. The law does not apply to this case. The only remedy necessary is to determine whether the excises required by the statute are valid. The response asserts that there is no need for a remedy because the tax is not a tax but a penalty charged for failing to collect it. Finally, the merits of these arguments are presented. The first argument is that the activity performed by the state governments is governmental. The second argument assumes that such activities do not fall under the category of a private business.

dissenting.
I am of opinion that the District Court had jurisdiction. •
So far as concerns the validity of the tax, the^University is the State. It is an instrumentality carrying on the state’s program of public education. The holding of the athletic contests in question is an integral part of that program and does not cease to be such because it produces income. The tax is imposed directly on and bur-, dens that activity of the State. The Court assumes the facts above stated and decides the case on that basis. The tax is laid on the charge paid for admission, is, to be borne by the person paying for admission, and is to be collected by the State and handed over to the tJnited States. It is hard to understand how the collection by the State of fees for the privilege of attendance brings, even for the púrpose^of federal taxation, its work of education to the level of selling intoxicating liquor, South Carolina v. United States, 199 U. S. 437; Ohio v. Helvering, 292 U. S. 360, operating a railway, Helvering v. Powers, 293 U. S. 214, or conducting any other commercial activity. The tax seems plainly within the rule of state immunity from federal taxation as hitherto understood and applied. I would affirm the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals.

They allege that the alcoholic beverage control act applies within the park and that they must apply for permits or sell licenses. The plaintiffs argue that the Act is not enforceable because it does not allow them to collect taxes. The court dismisses the complaint on the ground ""the Park is within exclusive jurisdiction of United States."" The district court granted a temporarily injunction and later granted an injunition.

The Supreme Court held that the Constitution did not allow the national government to exercise exclusive authority over land cedes to it by another state. The Federalist Papers furthermore suggest that the American government may make mutual arrangements as to how its territory will be managed. However, there is no question whether the federal government has the constitutional power to acquire land without consent or through cession. It is decided that the rights of persons and corporations are not sufficient to justify the prohibition on sale and use of alcohol beverages. The legislature had originally intended to grant exclusive jurisdiction over certain portions of the park but then changed the terms of the agreement so that only exclusive jurisdiction could be granted. The lower courts were concerned that the savings of the right-to tax persons and companies, their Franchises and property were not sufficiently broad enough to justify prohibiting the sale of beer and wine. Finally, the legislative provisions regarding excise taxes do not seem to fit into the definition of liquor sales. Thus, the laws required by the Act cannot be applied directly to those licensed; instead, they require express exception from such provisions.

The court disagrees with this conclusion because the trust was not intended to make provisions for the beneficiaries after his death; instead, it was meant to ensure that the property could be used for His daughter and her grandchildren after his demise.",1938-11-07,1.0

  On an appeal from a judgment for the plaintiff in an action at law, in which a jury was waived, the Circuit Court of Appeals refused to consider certain assignments of error upon the ground that they related to findings requested by the defendant after the trial had been concluded. The judgment was affirmed, 90 F. 2d 644, and certiorari was granted. We were unable to accept the conclusion of the Circuit Court of Appeals that when the trial court ordered “that judgment be entered for plaintiff, with interest and costs, upon findings of fact and conclusions of law to be presented,” it was thereafter “too late adequately to present special findings of fact.” It was not necessary to treat the first order for judgment as ending “the progress of the trial.” 28 U. S. C. 875. The qualifying words in the order were appropriate to suggest a “reservation of opportunity for further action.” Accordingly, the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals was reversed and the cause was remanded to that court for further proceedings in conformity with the opinion of this Court.

  On application of the defendant, this Court issued a rule directing the judges of the Circuit Court of Appeals to show cause why the judgment should not be vacated and the court be required to consider the assignments of error. The judges have made return to the rule.
 

  While it appears from the bill of exceptions that the defendant “served and lodged its proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law,” and the transcript contains a paper described as defendant’s proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, that paper is not included in the bill of exceptions and hence is not properly authenticated. 28 U.

  Plaintiff sought judgment declaring invalid a statute imposing a tax on “the receipt of cosmetics in the State by any Kentucky retailer,”
  
   1
  
  as applied to articles purchased from manufacturers and dealers in other States and transported to plaintiff at its place of business in Kentucky. Plaintiff contended that the tax was on “the act of receiving” and hence was a direct burden upon interstate commerce. The Court of Appeals of Kentucky thus construed the statute:
 

  “The word
  
   ‘receipt’ is not
  
  used in a limited sense, but in the sense that it has already been received by the retailer and is now in his use. . ‘. . That word 'receipt’ pre
   
   *381
   
  supposes that the cosmetics were now in use and after the sale had been consummated.
 


   “ . . .
  
  It, therefore, follows that the imposition of the tax against the retailer is not on the act of receiving the cosmetics, but on the sale and use thereof, after the retailer has received them, that constitutes the excise tax. When we apply the intended and correct meaning of the word ‘receipt’ as used in the act, it is conclusive to' our minds that the tax of the retailer, referred to, is paid when the articles are in his possession and when the merchant has unlimited control and dominion over the cosmetics.”

The federal court dismisses the suit on the grounds that it had been granted permission to bring the suit against the Indians without consent. The state court has no jurisdiction over the matter since the United States does not have any authority to condemn the land. The district court reverses the judgment with directions to dismiss.

2856,9418998,103118,020lead,"In this case, the question is whether a suit for part of an unpaid 1920 tax is barred because of a lapse of time. Duggan was the principal owner of Johnson City and Big Muddy Copper and Mining Company in 1921. He had been forced to pay back his taxes by delaying payment on December 6, 1926. The amount proposed by him was not sufficient to satisfy his claim. On February 14, 1932, the board ordered that there be no further assessment until the amount proposed was determined. This decision was not reviewed; however, it was decided that the amount should be collected within six years from the date of the original assessment. The court granted leave to amend its complaint. The first section of the law governs collection of taxes: ""A transferee"" of property must be assessed immediately after the due date. If the collector believes that the assessor will be delayed by delay, he shall promptly assess the debt and demand the collector for payment. However, if the collector does not believe that the burden of collecting the debt will be passed on to the collector, then the collector may only collect the balance found on the return of the bill. The period of limitations on collection of the debt also applies to transfers of property. It is necessary for the collector to make such a determination before the lawsuit is brought.",1939-01-03,1.0

The second ""transformee,"" as we now call him, is a property owner and his tax liability is subject to assessment, distraint, and collection. The limitation period for collecting the tax from an initial transferee expires six years after the date of the original tax payment. However, the statute of limits for collection of taxes from the first-transferor is extended until March 1932, at least as the opinion in the court states. This means that by virtue of the fact that the property receives money, it becomes subjects to the tax burden of the first transferor.",1939-01-03,1.0

The veteran who brought suit against his policy claims that it was not renewed because of the provisions in  30 but because of special provisions under  507. The court acquiesces to the claim. Congress had originally passed a law providing for government insurance with medical examination for people engaged in war service. However, after September 9, 1921 congress added a second provision giving veterans the right to reinstate their yearly term insurance even if they were physically disabled. This first section allowed veterans to revive their accumulated term insurance when they were suffering from any kind of physical or mental disability.

The court dismisses the appeal as unworthy of merit since the question presented does not seem to be lacking merit. It is decided that the carrier must maintain the switch track on land owned by the gas-551 company and other companies who serve the industry. The carriers agreement to pay $300 annual fee for the maintenance of an elevated part of the tracks across the streets or alleys but refuses to accept additional burden when the city passes an order authorizing use only for 20 years. On December 10, 1923, the city passing an order Authorizing Use of the Streets for 20 Years from Expiration of the 1901 Ordinance, increases the annual fee at $1,400 per year, and requires a bond so that the contract will not be forfeited. Since 1903, the carrier has continued to operate the track. However, there is no profit made from using the track; instead, it seeks an order demanding payment of costs of maintenance and new equipment. The state Supreme Court disagrees with the court's interpretation of the Due Process Clause: ""As between the private and the railroad,"" the track is openly used for industrial purposes. A track that has been built for industrial uses on and across publicly thoroughfares becomes part ofthe main line of railway system which joins and subject to government regulation in the national interest.""

This is an important distinction since the legislature of Porto Rica did not explicitly allow the collector to sue for refund in the 1921 law. Furthermore, the legislature also omitted section 76, which prohibits any suit made by a voluntary taxpayer who pays without protest.

Petitioning for an allowance of attorney's fees and expenses beyond the regular tax costs, the court denied it. The district court granted the petition because it was not allowed to grant such costs after the Supreme Court or the circuit court had already passed a decree disallowing them. Both courts refused to grant the request because they believed that the award of these costs would be beyond the authority of either court. However, both courts held that the petition was ""further limiter by restrictions"" which terms of law may impose. Although both courts deemed the petition disallowance as a consideration of cost outside the powers of the district court, they decided that the amount of the loan was more than sufficient enough to discharge all of its debts. In this case, neither party could establish a class of claims against the same bonds; instead, the parties established their claims through staredecisis rather than with a binding decree. This means that the claim for the loan cannot be directly implied in the original lawsuit. It can only be implied if there is some kind of implied contract between the parties involved. Therefore, the question of whether the loan is explicitly covered by the original order or by the mandate is entirely different from the issue presented here.

Mr. Justice McReynolds and Mr. Justice Butler,
dissenting.
We are of opinion that the decree below should be affirmed.
In our view the challenged order of the Secretary must succumb to two manifest objections. It is unnecessary for us to dissect the record in search of other impediments.
First. Congress possesses the powers delegated by the Constitution — no others. The opinion of this Court in Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States (1935), 295 U. S. 495 — noteworthy because of modernity and reaffirmation of ancient doctrine — sufficiently demonstrates the absence of Congressional authority to manage private. business affairs under the transparent guise of regulating interstate commerce. True, production and distribution of milk are most important enterprises, not easy of wise execution; but so is breeding the cows, authors of the commodity; also, sowing and reaping the fodder which inspires them.
Second. If perchance Congress possesses power to manage the milk business within the various states, authority so to do cannot be committed to another. A cursory examination of the statute shows clearly enough the design to allow a secretary to prescribe áccording to his own. errant will and then to execute. This is not government .by law but by caprice. Whimseys may displace delibér*583ate action by chosen representatives and become rules of conduct. To us the outcome seems wholly incompatible with the system under which we are supposed to live.

He defends the provision for cooperative and proprietary handlers to sell milk in the marketplace at an arbitrary rate.

Hood and Sons, a manufacturer of dairy products in the Massachusetts market area, and Noble's Milk Company, an association of milk sellers. The lawsuit is brought before the District Court on October 1, 1937 to enforce the terms of order No. 4 under theAgricultural Marketing Act. The court finds that the purchase power of milk cannot be determined for the postwar period because of the lack of available statistics from the Department of Ag. On February 6, 1936, the secretary makes a determination as to whether or not to issue an Order. After hearings, the orders are finally issued. A price fixing provision is added to the order. The value of milk is calculated by multiplying quantities used by each handler according to the class price. Each handler receives payment less than the amount required to be calculated for such handlingr. The plaintiff also contends that the Constitution does not allow amending orders without finding out how long the base period is. The Secretary may conduct a Referendum among producers who have been engaged in selling milk in the marketplace during the Representative Period. This means that some of the farmers who shipped cream to the Boston market area could not sell their milk at all. They were allowed to vote only through ballots made by their board of directors.

2945,103232,103232,010combined,"In this case, the Court argues that a donor who retains the right to change the terms of his trust is not subject to tax until the power to do so is relinquished. The court concludes that the gift must be made ""complete and taxable"" at the time when the power has been reserved to the grantor. It was in 1913 that decedent created an inter-vivos trust where he had the power either to terminate it or to amend it. He did not relinquish the power but only relinqueshed it after the death of his son. After the date of the law's first gift tax, deterred by the Board ofTax Appeals, the Trust became complete and untaxed upon the final reversion of the power on August 20, 1924. This decision was followed by two other cases: one concerning the transfer of property with power reserved for the donor; and another dealing with transfers at death which are subject to the same tax as gifts made in consideration of death. Both cases were based on the fact that Congress had no purpose to tax such gifts before the recipient had fully parteded with his interests in the property. The government concedes that there is nothing specific in the statute regarding the powers of revocating the power of the donor. However, the courts have consistently interpreted the provisions of the federal tax laws to apply to both types of transfers. For example, the 1832 Act allows a gift to be treated as if it were a transaction between the donor and the beneficiary. Thus, the gift cannot be considered complete because the donor has given up his power to alter the title of the property without making any further contribution to the estate. If the gift does not become complete, then the tax will be levied even though the new beneficiaries are not entitled to receive the property from the original owner. Finally, the petitioner asserts that these provisions provide sufficient control over the amount of money that the donor can use to pay the tax. The question remaining remains whether the constitution should be modified according to the force of legislative regulation or administrative practice",1939-12-04,2.0

Although the courts have generally accepted the doctrine that a foreign company must reside in the same place as its creation and cannot move to another state, the fact that it is required by Congress to designate an agent who can serve as a mediator in return for consent to be brought in federal courts has led to some confusion. For example, the 1887 act prohibiting foreign corporations from being sued in any other state than the one in which the company is located makes it impossible for the company to be sued outside the state. Thus, the House of Representatives' provision restricting the growth of civil lawsuits to the national courts was intended to affect the significance of the clause ""he shall befound"" under the 1886 act. However, the legislature did not explicitly include the clause in the bill; instead, it contained a section specifically designed to limit the growing number of civil cases that could be brought before the federal courts through the use of the fiction of citizenship. Therefore, even though the House removed the word ""he will be found,"" the legislation still allowed foreign corporations with their consent to go to the United States courts.

  On March 25, 1935, Heitmeyer, respondent here, applied for a permit from the Federal Communications Commission under § 319 of the Communications Act of 1934, c. 652, 48 Stat. 1089, 47 U. S. C. 319, to construct a broadcasting station at Cheyenne, Wyoming”. His application and a competing one were heard by an examiner. The Commission, on May 1, 1936, denied respondent’s application on the sole'ground that he was financially disqualified. He appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia and the Commission’s decision was reversed.

  The only relevant difference between the two cases is that here the Commission proposed on remand not only to reconsider respondent’s application on oral argument with subsequently filed rival applications, but to reopen the record and take new evidence on the comparative ability of the various applicants to satisfy “public convenience, interest, or necessity.” But the Commission’s duty was to apply the statutory standard in deciding which of the applicants was to receive a permit after it fell into legal error as well as before. If, in the Commission’s judgment, new evidence was necessary to discharge its duty, the fact of a previously erroneous denial should not, according to the principles enunciated in the

Mr. Justice Roberts,
dissenting:'
The petitioners’ proration order is challenged not merely as unfair or unreasonable but as confiscatory of the respondent’s property. Upon the allegations of the bill, the District Court had jurisdiction. Although the problem of proration presented technical and difficult questions, and although the Commission was vested with a broad discretion in dealing with them, these facts could not justify the court’s abdicating its jurisdiction to test the Commission’s order. The case was tried de novo and neither the full record made before the Commission nor its findings appear in the evidence, except for what is contained in the Commission’s orders. After a painstaking trial, and upon detailed and well supported findings of fact, the court reached the conclusion that the order worked a confiscation of respondent’s property.1 The court said: “The respondents’ [petitioners’] engineers frankly admitted that the present scheme of proration is nothing more or less than one on a per well basis.” Referring to such a basis, the court added: “It is sufficient to say that it takes no account of the difference in the wells, of the richness or thickness of the sand, of the *585location upon the structure, of the porosity or permeability of the sand, of the estimated oil reserves, or of the acreage upon which the respective wells are situated. The worst property is raised to the level of the best and the best is lowered to the level of the worst.” The court concluded that the order operated to appropriate, for the benefit of others, the respondent’s oil without compensation.
The Circuit Court of Appeals approved and adopted the findings and conclusions of the District Court.2
The opinion of this court, in my judgment, announces principles with respect to the review of administrative action challenged under the due process clause directly contrary to those which have been established. A recent exposition of the applicable principles is found in the opinion of Mr. Justice Brandéis, written for a unanimous court, in Thompson v. Consolidated Gas Utilities Corp., 300 U. S. 55, dealing with a proration order affecting gas, entered by the same commission which entered the order here in issue.

  The State of Tennessee brought this suit to enforce payment of privilege taxes measured by premiums on policies -of insurance issued while appellant.was doitig business /. Within the State, but upon1 which the premiums were paid . after its withdrawal from the State. Appellant contended that since its withdrawal it had transacted no business within the State; that the policyholders there had mailed their premiums on unmatured policies to the home office of appellant in another State; and that to hold it liable for •thetaxes demanded would deprive it of its property in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution pf. the United States.
 

  ' The Supreme Court of Tennessee sustained the tax. It construed the statutory provisions to mean “that the tax is levied upon the right to do business in the state, measured by a percentage of annual premiums to the éxclusion of all. other taxes, the tax on the annual premiums to be paid throughout the life of policies issued”; that though “measured by two and a half per cent of premiums received oil policies issued by the company while exercising its license from the state, the tax was levied upon the privilege of entering the state ánd engaging in the insurance business, and not upon the annual premiums”; and that the appellant “by its compliance with the statute adopted and agreed to-the construction we have given it; and cannot now. repudiate its provisions.” 137 S.

The separate opinion of
Mr. Justice McReynolds.
The facts were stipulated. In the. opinion of the court below the issues are thus adequately stated—
“The petitioner owned a number of coupon bonds. The coupons represented the interest on the bonds and were payable to bearer. In 1934 he detached unmatured coupons of face value of $25,182.50 and transferred them, by manual delivery to his son as a gift. The coupons natured later on in the same year, and the son collected the. face amount, $25,182.50, as his own property. There *121was a similar transaction, in 1935. The petitioner kept his. books on a cash basis. He did not include any part of the moneys collected on the coupons in his income tax returns for these two years. The son included them in his returns. The Commissioner • added the moneys collected on the coupons to thé petitioner’s taxable income and determined a tax deficiency for each year. The Board of Tax Appeals, three members dissenting, sustained the Commissioner, holding that the amounts collected on the coupons were taxable, as income to the petitioner.”
The decision of the Board of Tax Appeals ivas reversed, and properly so, I think.
The unmatured coupons given to the son were independent negotiable instruments, complete in themselves. Through the gift they became at once the absolute property of the donee, free from the donor’s control and in no way dependent upon ownership of the bonds. No question of actual fraud or purpose to defraud the' revenue is presented.
Neither Lucas v. Earl, 281 U. S. 111, nor Burnet v. Leininger, 285 U. S. 136, support petitioner’s view. Blair v. Commissioner, 300 U. S. 5, 11, 12, shows that neither involved an unrestricted completed transfer of property.
Helvering v. Clifford, 309 U. S. 331, 335, 336, decided, after the opinion below, is much relied upon by petitioner, but involved facts very different from those now before us. There no separate thing was absolutely transferred and put beyond possible control by the transferror. The Court affirmed that Clifford, both conveyor and trustee, “retained the substance of full enjoyment of all the rights which previously he had in the 'property.” “In substance his control over the corpus was in all essential • respects the same after the trust was created, as before.” “With that control in his hands he would keep direct *122command over'all that he needed to remain in substantially the same financial situation as before.”

Mr. Justice Stone
delivered the opinion of the Court.
This is a companion case to Helvering v. Horst, ante, p. 112, and presents issues not distinguishable from those in that case.
Respondent, a general life insurance agent, after the termination of his agency contracts and services as agent, máde assignments in 1924 and 1928 respectively of renewal commissions to become payable to him for services' which had been rendered in writing policies of insurance under two of his agency contracts. The Commissioner assessed the renewal commissions paid by the companies to the assignees in 1933 as income taxable to the assignor in that year under the provisions of the 1932 Revenue Act, 47 Stat. 169, § 22 of which does not differ in any respect now material from § 22 of the 1934 Revenue Act involved in the Horst case. The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the order of the Board of Tax Appeals sustaining the assessment. 110 F. 2d 737; 39 B. T. A. 583. We granted certiorari October 14, 1940.
No purpose of the assignments appears other than to confer on the assignees the power to collect the commis*125sions, which they did in the taxable year. The Government and respondent have briefed and argued the case here on the assumption that the assignments were voluntary transfers to the assignees of the right to collect the commissions as and when they became payable, and the record affords no basis for any other.
For the reasons stated at length in the opinion in the Horst case, we hold that, the commissions were taxable as income of the assignor in the year when paid. The judgment, below is

The answer is that the debter must have a ""reasonable hope or expectation"" of repaying the loan within three years.

Me. Justice Frankfurter,
dissenting:
On January 3, 1939, this Court unanimously decided that the “actual damage or injury” caused the lessor through the disaffirmance by the trustees of the New Haven of the lease now in controversy was a provable claim. Connecticut Ry. v. Palmer, 305 U. S. 493. If Congress had intended to rule out the legal provability of a claim for damages arising through the disaffirmance of what remains of a 999-year lease it could easily have done so, instead of providing for proof of the damages flowing from the termination of such an unexpiréd lease. And if, upon the prior consideration of the status of this very lease, this Court had intended to rule that loss due to the disaffirmance of the unexpired term of 969 years is in the nature of things beyond rational proof, it surely would not have taken twelve pages to avoid saying so. Both Congress and this Court have thus sponsored the conviction that proof of some damage is not outside the adjudicatory process.
But what is to be assessed is the value of a terminated long-term lease and not the value of an included short-term. Therefore, neither the decision of the district court nor that of the circuit court of appeals in reversing it seems to me satisfactory. Although the two courts reached contradictory conclusions, their views appear to suffer from the same intrinsic vice. Starting with man’s inability to pierce into a future of 969 years, both courts *563deemed the present value of a leáse running for such a period beyond calculable, forecast. Therefore, Judge Hincks said in effect, when an end is put to the benefits accruing from such a lease, the loss to the lessor cannot be translated into dollars and cents. Judge Patterson, on the other hand, treated the lease as though it were a lease for an ascertainable, included short term,- and deemed eleven years as the limit for sure judgment. Since the lease is not a short-term lease, it is, according to the district court, nothing for purpose of giving rise to damages. Since the lease is for too long a term, we will snip off an included short term as though it were a short-term"" lease, concluded the circuit court of appeals.
Both these dispositions result in avoidance, through over-simplification, of an extremely complicated problem 'which Congress has put up to the courts. Since neither the district court nor the circuit court of appeals applied the directions of this Court in Connecticut Ry. v. Palmer, supra, however difficult and subtle they may have been, neither disposition should stand. The case should.be sent back to the district court where an opportunity should be given to make proofs appropriate' to the nature of the problem to be solved, namely, ascertainment on a tough business basis of the damage that sprang into existence from the disaffirmance of the remaining 969-year term rather than from the disaffirmance of a supposed 11-year lease.

In contrast, the court does not believe that an 11-year term will be sufficient to satisfy the claimant because it does not cover the entire term.

  delivered the opinion of the Court.
 

  The question here is the same as that in
  
   Guggenheim
  
  v.
  
   Rasquin, ante,
  
  p. 254. Consequently the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals holding that cash-surrender value on the dates of the gifts was the proper method of valuing single-premium life insurance policies for gift-tax purposes (114 F. 2d 150) must be reversed, unless the elapse of time between the issuance of the policies and the making of the gifts calls for a different result. The single-premium policies here involved were taken out by the insured in 1928 and 1929. They were assigned as gifts in December, 1934, when the insured was 79 years old. The cost of the policies was less than their cash-surrender value at the dates of the gifts. But the cost of replacing the policies at the then age of the insured would have been in excess of their cash-surrender value. We think that such cost of replacement, as held by the District Court, is the best available criterion of the value' of the policies for the purposes of the gift tax. The elapse of time between issuance and assignment of the policies does not justify the substitution of cash-surrender value for replacement cost as the criterion of value. We cannot assume with respondents that at the dates of the gifts the policies presumably had no insurance, as distinguished from investment, value to the donor. Here, as in the case where the issuance of the policies and their assignment as gifts are simultaneous, cash-surrender value reflects only a part of the value of the contracts. The cost of duplicating the policies at the dates of the gifts is, in absence of more cogent evidence, the one criterion which reflects both their insurance and investment value to the owner at that time. Cf. Vance on

  Insurance (2d ed.) pp. 332-333;
  
   Speer
  
  v.
  
   Phoenix Mutual Life Ins. Co.,
  
  36 Hun 322. The fact that the then condition of an insured’s health might make him uninsurable emphasizes the conclusion that the use of that criterion will result in placing a minimum value upon such a gift.

The Supreme Court supports the injuntion on the grounds that violence was considered an essential aspect of the decision. However, the Illinois supreme court does not support the indictment on the basis that the state Supreme Court justified its decision by reference to violent behavior.

Although the petitioners claim that they will be punished for writing or publishing anything about the matter, the indenture prohibits them from doing so. If the newspaper publishes any mention of the issue, then the publisher may be subject to punishable contempt.

  The members of the Guild involved in this case are designers and manufacturers of women’s hats. Their Guild operates a plan modelled after that of the Fashion Originators’ Guild of America, Inc.
 

  It was stipulated by the parties that “The capacity, tendency, purpose, and result of the plan . . . and the acts and practices performed thereunder . . . have been, and now are, to restrain commerce by eliminating manufacturers of stylish hats ... as to the outlets of their products and by limiting the retail dealers ... as to their source of supply, and to deprive the public of the benefits, if any, of competition as to price or otherwise among retailers of stylish hats in this respect . . .” Pursuant to the evidence and to the stipulation containing this statement, the Commission found that the effect of the plan was “unduly to hinder competition and to create monopoly in the sale of women’s hats in interstate commerce.”
 

  The respects in which the plan of the Millinery Creator’s Guild differs from that of the Fashion Originators’ Guild are not material, and need not be set out in detail. Nor need the findings of the Commission be enumerated here. The Commission did find that the Millinery Creator’s Guild had tended to hinder competition and create monopoly “By depriving the public of the benefits of normal price competition among retailers of stylish hats for women,” a finding not made in the other case, but the presence or absence of such a finding is not determinative here.

The court overrules the plea on three grounds: petitioner did not sworn during the hearings or testify against himself; no evidence was presented by petitioner; and each of the trial hearings complained about was recessed just after the plea of immunity. In addition, the Government attaches an afficidavit that the United States Attorney told the court that they have the transcripts available in the proceedings. The Court overruled the plea but granted petitioner permission to crossexamine. The case is appealed to the Supreme Court. It is decided that it is necessary for petitioner to show proof of his crimes because of his identity and his relationships to the companies involved in the fraudulent scheme.

  “The taxpayer transferred securities to a third party in trust to pay the income to his wife. At the end of five years, or earlier if the beneficiary consented, the securities were to be transferred back to the taxpayer. The Board of Tax Appeals held that the grantor was not

   “2.
  
  Whether, on the merits, the trust income was taxable as income of the grantor under Section 22.”

It is clear that the amount of unfinished business should be determined as soon as the death occurs. This means that the balance of the funds collected during the period of the execution of the contract must be calculated.

  On July 31, 1037, appellant filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission a passenger tariff establishing a fare of 10 cents for interstate transportation on its downtown line in lieu of the existing fare of 6 cents. The Commission suspended the tariff and after full hearing found that the revenue results to appellant would be more favorable under an 8-cent fare than under a 10-cent fare and further determined that the proposed 10-cent fare would be unreasonable under §§ 1 and 15a of the
   
   *99
   
  Interstate Commerce Act and that an 8-cent fare had been justified.
 

  The Commission directed the cancellation of the schedule filed, without prejudice to the establishment of an 8-cent fare, and accordingly, in July, 1938, appellant canceled its proposed tariff and put into effect a fare of 8 cents. The Commission refused a rehearing.
 

  In June,1939, appellant brought this suit to set aside the Commission’s order. The case was heard in the District Court by three judges upon the record made before the Commission, and the court rendered its decision in June, 1940, holding that the findings of the Commission were based upon substantial evidence and that the order was within the Commission’s authority, was not confiscatory, and did not deprive appellant of its property without due process of law. 33 F.

The Company refuses to bargain with representatives of its workers in all six plants that are located in five states; the Crystal City Plant is excluded from the entire division because it does not have a majority among the employees there. The Board decides that the Production and maintenance employees at all six plant of its flat-glass division constitute the appropriate group for collective bargainment. The Crystal city union is not named as party in the original complaint against the company. The Federal of Flat Glass Workers, an affiliate under the Congress of industrial organization, has dominated all the employees within the flat glass unit except Crystal City. This decision was made on January 13, 1938, after hearing testimony about the history of Collective Barting. The board finds that the production/maintenance employees throughout the whole flat glass division constitute an appropriate part of the proper unit. The crystal city union cannot be included in any proceeding regarding the choice of representatives since the Union is not regarded as a member of the company's employees. The court also dismisses the petitioners' request for additional evidence concerning the Crystalcity union. It is decided that the Crystal Cleopatra Union will be the bargainer representative for all members of the employee body. The Constitution allows the Board to determine whether the worker should be represented by a union. However, the fact that no one else can represent the employer directly makes it impossible for them to present evidence supporting their claim that the union would be the best bargaining representative. The only evidence available supports the conclusion that they must choose the appropriate unit according to the needs of the workers. The record shows that the Federation tried to organize the Company on three different levels: 1) through local union meetings, 2) through written labor agreements, and 3) through direct negotiations with the Company.

Mr. Justice Douglas:
While I agree with the opinion of the Court, I think an elaboration of the point, which is the nub of the case, is desirable in view of certain observations in the dissenting opinion.
Appellant is a corporation formed under § 141 of New York Railroad Law, which provides for consolidation of railroad corporations. On the filing of the articles or agreement of consolidation, the several constituent companies “shall be one corporation by the name provided in such agreement.” And § 141 also provides that “such act of consolidation shall not release such new corporation from any of the restrictions, liabilities or duties of the several corporations so consolidated.” By § 143 all debts of the constituent companies “shall thenceforth attach to such new corporation, and be enforced against it and its property to the same extent as if incurred or contracted by it.” We are pointed to no provision of the New York law which would permit the creation of the new consolidated corporation without the attachment of the debts of the constituent companies.
Snyder v. New York, C. & St. L. R. Co., 118 Oh. St. 72, 160 N. E. 615, aff’d 278 U. S. 578, held that authority from *374the Commission was not necessary to create this consolidated corporation. A necessary and inherent incident of its creation was the attachment of these obligations. Hence, I do not see how we can say that, although authority from the Commission was not necessary to create appellant, such authority was necessary in order for this consolidated corporation to meet the requirements which the New York law exacted as conditions to its creation. But if we held that an attachment of liability under the New York Consolidation Act was an “assumption” of liability within the meaning of § 20 (a), we would be doing just that. Hence, I feel forced to conclude that, in case of this type of consolidation, “assumption” in § 20 (a) does not include attachment of liability by virtue of the filing of articles of consolidation under a state statute, though it would, of course, include the issuance of any security or the incurrence or extension of any obligation subsequent to consolidation. Such is one consequence of the failure to follow Commissioner Eastman’s views in Acquisition and Stock Issue of N. Y., C. & St. L. R. Co., 79 I. C. C. 581. But I do not see how, in all fairness, we can reopen at this late stage the unfortunate decision in the Snyder case.

3138,9419193,103569,030concurrence,"Justice Jackson defends Duckworth's transportation of liquor to the states. He argues that the Constitution's twenty-first amendment allows for state control over alcohol as a matter of interstate commerce, and this creates a distinction between state powers over interstate trade and state powers about commerce in general; the people of the U.S. knew that liquor was a lawless unto itself, and they decided that it should have a specific constitutional provision. They didn't let the courts devise special laws to curb liquor's ""tendency"" to get away from legal bounds. The Court dismisses the Arkansas prohibition on liquor entering the territory by consignment under contract. It is clear that the court believes that Congress has the power to regulate such laws beyond what the Court has approved.

In particular, the Federal Bankruptcy Act of 1920 did not have a priority on debtors who had borrowed money under the authority of Congress.

  Petitioner, the Royal Italian Ambassador, seeks leave to file in this Court a petition for writs of prohibition and mandamus, directed to the United States District Court
   
   *511
   
  for the District of New Jersey. The basis of this application is petitioner’s allegation that a vessel and its cargo of oil, the subject of litigation in the District Court and now in its possession, are the property of the Italian Government and are entitled to the benefit of Italy’s sovereign immunity from suit.
 

  After the motion was filed, there occurred on December 11, 1941, the declaration that the United States is at war with Italy. Section 2 (b) of the Trading with the Enemy Act, 40 Stat. 411, defines “enemy” to include the government of any nation with which the United States is at war. Section 7 (b) contains the following provision, 40 Stat. at 417:
 

  “Nothing in this Act shall be deemed to authorize the prosecution of any suit or action at law or in equity in any court within the United States by an enemy or ally of enemy prior to the end of the war, except as provided in section ten hereof” [which relates to patent, trademark and copyright suits] “. . .
  
   And -provided further,
  
  That an enemy or ally of enemy may defend by counsel any suit in equity or action at law which may be brought against him.”
 

  This provision was inserted in the Act in the light of the principle, recognized by Congress and by this Court, that war suspends the right of enemy plaintiffs to prosecute actions in our courts. See S. Repts. Nos. 111 and 113, pp. 21, 24, 65th Cong., 1st Sess.;

The court finds that the applicant's predecessor, on June 1, 1935, has been in bon- fide operation since then as common carriers by motor vehicles throughout the territory covered by the Grandfather Clause of the Act. The district court disagrees with the decision. It says that it is reasonable to restrict the certificate to certain types of service rendered during the grandfather term and to limit its territory to those within which substantial services of that type have been rendered. However, the District Court believes that such restrictions are not authorized by Congress because they do not apply regularly route carriers. Furthermore, there is no distinction between regular route carriers like Appellee and irregular route travelers like appelleus. The only restriction allowed by the statute is that the carriage of certain specified goods must be carried out at designated points. Although the definition of ""complainant"" does not specify specific classes of goods, the fact that some items may have been transported before but not yet after June 1, 1938 makes it clear that the burden of proof rests on the person who actually performs the transportation service. In this case, however, the question of whether or not an applicant is ""in bona Fide operation"" for the purpose of transporting passengers or property over irregular routes is similar to that of any other carrier. Thus, even if one can prove that his prior activities were ""inbona fides operation,"" the test of whether he was ""in Bona fide Opera"" depends on the particular product being transported. For example, if a manufacturer had previously carried a large number of products, he would not be permitted to carry more than a few; if another manufacturer had carried many kinds of products from one place to another, the test would be different. Finally, the issue of whether an individual could travel southbound on a northbound trip is decided by the same stricter test used for railroad carriers.",1942-03-02,2.0

3171,103628,103628,010combined,"In this case, the United States and New York seek a judgment from the Second Circuit Court reaffirming part of an order for distribution of the bankrupt's assets. The amount is insufficient to satisfy all of the claims asserted against the federal government and state governments as well as certain taxes not covered by the bankruptcy. The State appeals to the court again but rejects the district court's decision. First, the claim under title VIII is based on ""a tax that every individual equal to 1 percentum of the wage received by him during 1938."" The District Court disagrees with the argument made by the Supreme Court; it states that the burden of collecting the tax must rest upon the employer rather than on the employee. It also contends that there are two distinctions between these cases: one is that the tax ""shall be collection by the employer"" and the other is that both Title VIII and the Social Security act are designed to levy two distinct taxes. For example, Section 801 provides that employers can collect the tax without deducting it from wages. Under section 901, however, the employer can credit against the income tax incurred by the worker. This allows the employer to make a contribution to the unemployment fund. However, because the employer cannot contribute directly to the fund, the amount required to pay the bill is determined. If the employer fails to make any contribution to its unemployment fund, then the employer has no choice but to take advantage of the fact that the funds will not be enough to pay off all of his remaining claims. Finally, the courts have accepted an algebraic formula which reduces the amount due to the total amount allowed to the U.S. on each claim.

The court reverses the charges because it believes that the jury failed to instruct them properly regarding the exception to the definition of ""bona fide"" employees. The government contends that the exception applies only when a person has enjoyed the privilege of being an employee before the date of the purchase or attempted to obtain wages. However, the law does not specifically define bona fides employees as those who have attained status after the time they obtain or try to obtain the pay of wages. In fact, Congress did not intend to prohibit such activities but rather set up severe punishments for these activities. This bill, however, contained no mention of wages nor any mention of labor.

However, the court does not believe that such payments should be considered wages since they are made only to protect victims from violence. The jury finds that all the conspirators were rightfully convicted. All of the charges against them were for conspiracy under the anti-robbery act. If the defendants were accused of having obtained money through force and violent activity, then there is no penalty for the crime.

*609Mr. Justice Feankfubtee,
concurring:
I wholly agree with the opinion of the Chief Justice.
Congress has in the Natural Gas Act specifically cast upon courts the duty to review orders of the Federal Power Commission fixing “just and reasonable” rates. The constitutional scope of judicial review of rate orders where Congress has denied judicial review is therefore not in issue in this case. Discussion of the problem is academic, especially since we all concur in the Chief Justice’s conclusions on the rate order here made by the Commission. But since the issue has been stirred, I add a few words because legal history still has its claims.
While the doctrine of “confiscation,” as a limitation to be enforced by the judiciary upon the legislative power
to fix utility rates, was first applied in Chicago, M. & St. P. Ry. Co. v. Minnesota, 134 U. S. 418, that decision followed principles expounded in Stone v. Farmers’ Loan & Trust Co., 116 U. S. 307, especially at 331. See 134 U. S. at 465-56. Mr. Chief Justice Waite, who delivered the opinion in the Stone case as well as in the earlier decision in Munn v. Illinois, 94 U. S. 113, was therefore the author of the doctrine of “confiscation” and its corollary, “judicial review.” His view was shared by such stout respecters of legislative power over utilities as Mr. Justice Miller (see Fairman, Mr. Justice Miller and the Supreme Court, passim), Mr. Justice Bradley (see his dissent in Chicago, M. & St. P. Ry. Co. v. Minnesota, 134 U. S. 418, 461), and Mr. Justice Harlan. The latter, indeed, agreed with Mr. Justice Field' that the regulatory power exercised in the Railroad Commission Cases, 116 U. S. 307, constituted an impairment of the obligation of contract. By no one was the doctrine of judicial review more emphatically accepted, and applied in favor of a public utility, than by Mr. Justice Harlan in the decision and opinion in Covington & Lexington Turnpike Co. v. Sandford, 164 U. S. 578, especially at 591-95.
*610But while this historic controversy over the constitutional limitations upon the power of courts in rate cases is not presented here, if it be deemed that courts have nothing to do with rate-making because that task was committed exclusively to the Commission, surely it is a usurpation of the Commission’s function to tell it how it should discharge this task and how it should protect the various interests that are deemed to be in its, and not in our, keeping.

It is argued that Fortunana Estates was granted rights to draw water from the river below the irrigation system in order to improve the quality of the system and to prevent future losses by non-utility. The contract between the two parties stipulated that Fortuntaa would receive an amount of ""fair equivalent"" of water for irrigation purposes. However, this agreement did not allow Fortuna to take any more water than it had been entitled to under the contract. In 1921, the legislature adopted an act fixing a tax on certain lands using water obtained from the Southern coast public irrigation system. The petitioner brought suit against the government for several years because the taxes were too high. The court disagreed with the judgment but ultimately upheld the decision. The Constitution recognized the need to provide a way for land owners who fell within the proposed irrigation district to release their rights and be paid fair value. The owner of lands falling within the new irrigation district could surrender their rights or be declared entitled to receiving an amount equal to the price of water delivered to them. Although the contract does not explicitly state that the respondent will receive the same amount of water as Fortunans predecessor, the courts hold that the contract cannot be violated since it contains no covenant prohibiting the payment of such amounts.",1942-04-13,1.0

However, the Supreme Court interprets these contracts as meaning only that respondent receives certain quantities of water in return for its water right.

  Petitioner brought this suit in the district court to recover damages and for an injunction restraining trademark infringement and unfair competition. There was diversity of citizenship, and the bill of complaint alleged that “this suit arises under the Trademark Laws of the United States” and that petitioner’s wrapper design “was registered in the United States Patent Office by the plaintiff on May 1, 1936, under the No. 47748.” It prayed treble damages “in accordance with the provisions of the Trademark Law of 1906,” and was amended to allege registration of a second wrapper design in the Patent Office under the No. 46862.
 

  A decree for petitioner, 36 F. Supp. 730, was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. 122 F. 2d 318. Both courts below having failed to consider or apply local law, we granted certiorari, 314 U. S. 603, in order to determine whether local law or federal law should

  The opinions below, the printed record and the petition for certiorari give no indication that the suit was not founded upon a trademark registered under the 1905 Act, as the bill of complaint had made it appear. But an examination of the original exhibits, not printed in the record, and of petitioner’s brief on the merits here, discloses that the registration referred to is that of petitioner’s labels under the Copyright Law of the United States, and not registration under the Trademark Law. It thus appears that petitioner has alleged no cause of action under the Copyright Law and is not entitled to the benefits of registration under the Trademark Law. The only cause of action that this record could possibly support is for unfair competition and common law “trademark infringement,” to which local law applies. See

3196,103643,103643,010combined,"In this case, the employer, the electric vacuum cleaner company, is attempting to secure union members through a ""closed shop agreement"" that does not allow new employees to join. The petitioners are United Electrical and Railroad Workers of America, or Affiliates, which have been recognized as the agents of the workers since June 22, 1935. Since then, they have been given authority to conclude all agreements for hours of labor wages and other work conditions. On April 3, 1937, the plant is reopened under an extended contract. Only those employees who belong to the crafts will be allowed to work. This closed shop clause appears in a bi-monthly contract. Article III, entitled ""The Employer approves to employ sole members of the unions in good Standing in their respective unions,"" states that the employer may secure such employees elsewhere if the Unions cannot provide them with more employees. The refusal by the company to reinstate certain members gives rise to charges against unfair labor practices. The Federalist Papers defends the decision on the grounds that there was no further agreement between the employers and the affiliates. However, the Board disagrees with the argument that old employees were required to remain unimpaired during the year. The Court finds that the oral provisions did not change the circumstances where old employees could become members of another union. It also found that some old employees had to renew their membership prior to the open shop contract. Finally, the Company ordered a shut down of the entire factory from March 22rd to April 5; it was intended to prevent ""further proelting"" among the employees of the Affiliate's union. The answer to the question of whether assistance was granted to the Affiliates when the bargaining representatives were selected freely by majority of the employee is denied. The Proviso section reads: ""Nothing in this Act shall preclude An employer from making any agreement with / A labor organization / not established, maintained nor assisted by any actions defined in this act as an unfair labour practice."" Thus, the prohibition on interference at the time of closing the shop is violated. Furthermore, the invalidation of both the closed shop contract and the earlier contract means that the latter contract was invalid because the former contract was made without help from an assisted labor business. Therefore, the only evidence supporting the claim that the April-3rd arrangement would be invalid is that the previous contract was abandoned because of the efforts of the parties involved.

  In this case the National Labor Relations Board found that respondent, in refusing to reemploy a number of its former employees and to employ two new applicants, had discriminated against them in order to discourage membership in a labor union in violation of § 8 (1) and (3) of the National Labor Relations Act, 49 Stat. 449, 29 U. S. C. § 151. The Board made its order directing employment of these individuals with back pay. The Circuit Court of Appeals refused to enforce the Board’s order on the ground that its findings were without substantial support in the evidence. 122 F. 2d 687.
 

  Examination of the record discloses that there was substantial evidence from which the Board could have concluded that respondent’s refusal to employ the men was motivated by its belief that they had engaged or threatened to engage in destruction of respondent’s property and had threatened to injure some of respondent’s managerial employees and members of their families. There was also substantial evidence from which the Board could have concluded, as it did, that respondent’s motive for refusing the employment was discouragement of membership in a labor union. The possibility of drawing either of two inconsistent inferences from the evidence did not prevent the Board from drawing one of them, as the court below seems to have thought.

The court reduces petitioner's claim to $154,51.28; however, there are further provisions in the Constitution that require the government to pay interest only to the members who have been benefiting from the payment. This means that even if the government had known that the council was corrupt, they would not have paid the entire amount at once. Thus, the court does not find fault with the government's conduct toward the American Indians. Instead, it makes evidence as to whether or not the council knew about the corruption and venality of the officials responsible for the management of Indian affairs during the period involved.

The district court further finds that the absorption practices were wholly at odds with the General Purpose of the grain rate structure to bringabout an adjustment under which the prices would be on fairly the same level or an adjustment Under which the ratesto and from all west markets would approximate parity. The federal court enters the order challenging the authority of the commission to enforce the provisions of the interfederalist law. It finds that Section 1(6) of the Act prohibits common carriers from giving ""any unduly prefer or advantage to anybody particular person, locality, region, district territory, or anything specific description of traffic.""

If we had here only the question as to whether the issues framed by respondent in this suit could be litigated in the statutory garnishment proceeding in Missouri, I would agree with the views expressed by the Chief Justice. But there is the further, and for me the controlling, question whether, as stated by the majority, the claims raised by respondent had been “previously foreclosed” under Missouri law. It is a fair inference from this record that respondent, like Central, received notice and had an opportunity to defend the suit brought against Cooper-Jarrett, although all of the attendant circumstances do not clearly appear. Under Missouri law the general rule seems to be that notice and opportunity to defend binds the reinsurer on judgments against the reassured. See e. g. Strong v. Phoenix Ins. Co., 62 Mo. 289; Gantt v. American Central Ins. Co., 68 Mo. 503; City of St. Joseph v. Union Ry. Co., 116 Mo. 636, 643, 22 S. W. 794; Finkle v. Western Auto. Ins. Co., 224 Mo. App. 285, 300, 26 S. W. 2d 843. By statute (6 Mo. Stat. Ann. §§ 5898, 5899) the liability of the insurance company becomes absolute when loss occurs; and judgment against the insured establishes privity between the injured party and the insurer. See Schott v. Auto Ins. Underwriters, 326 Mo. 92, 31 S. W. 2d 7; Lajoie v. Central West Casualty Co., 228 Mo. App. 701, 71 S. W. 2d 803; Taverno v. American Auto Ins. Co., 232 Mo. App. 820, 112 S. W. 2d 941. The problem is whether by reason of the insurer’s liability under the policy and the statute, and *499respondent’s liability under its reinsurance contract (see e. g. Homan v. Employers Reinsurance Corp., 345 Mo. 650, 136 S. W. 2d 289), notice and opportunity to defend the earlier suit were sufficient (Schott v. Auto Ins. Underwriters, supra) to bind respondent as reinsurer. Respondent’s charges of fraud center on the adequacy of the notice which it received and the failure of the insured and the insurer to defend. That seems to be but one phase of the question whether under Missouri law respondent was bound by the judgment in the earlier suit.
The exercise of jurisdiction under the Federal Declaratory Judgments Act is certainly not compulsory; it is discretionary. Borchard, Declaratory Judgments (2d ed.), p. 312. If it may fairly be said under Missouri law that respondent was bound by its failure or refusal to defend the earlier suit after notice, then it would clearly be an abuse of discretion for the District Court to take or at least to retain jurisdiction of the cause in case it appeared after a hearing on that issue that respondent was so bound.

concurring:
I join the Chief Justice in holding that the hearings provided are too limited in the context of the present Act to afford due process of law. I also agree with the opinion of Mr. Justice Douglas that the scheme of classification set forth in the Act denies equal protection of the law. I disagree with the opinion of each in so far as it rejects or minimizes the grounds taken by the other.
Perhaps to employ a broad and loose scheme of classification would be permissible if accompanied by the individual hearings indicated by the Chief Justice. On the other hand, narrow classification with reference to the end to be accomplished by the Act might justify limiting individual hearings to the issue whether the individual belonged to a class so defined. Since this Act does not present these questions, I reserve judgment on them.
I also think the present plan to sterilize the individual in pursuit of a eugenic plan to eliminate from the race characteristics that are only vaguely identified and which in our present state of knowledge are uncertain as to transmissibility presents other constitutional questions of gravity. This Court has sustained such an experiment with respect to an imbecile, a person with definite and observable characteristics, where the condition had persisted through three generations and afforded grounds for the belief that it was transmissible and would continue to manifest itself in generations to come. Buck v. Bell, 274 U. S. 200.
There are limits to the extent to which a legislatively represented majority may conduct biological experiments at the expense of the dignity and personality and natural powers of a minority—even those who have been guilty of what the majority define as crimes. But this Act falls down before reaching this problem, which I mention only to *547avoid the implication that such a question may not exist because not discussed. On it I would also reserve judgment.

It is alleged that respondent has violated the Fair Labor Standard Act by contracting with its employees to pay their wages at different rates than they were previously paid. In order to comply with the provisions of the act, respondent negotiates contracts with each employee except those in mechanical departments. After the passage of the fair labor standards act, however, respondient attempts to adjust its wage system to meet requirements of the law by negotiating new contracts with all its employees except for those in the Mechanical Department. These contracts are written in the letter form of letters which are agreed to by an employee. The terms of these contracts are set at a fixed hourly rate. If an employee receives an increase in his pay, the hours will be adjusted accordingly. When an employee becomes entitled to more time, the weekly wage is adjusted. However, the court finds that the contracts are bona fides contracts of employment and that they were intended to fix the regularly rate at which each individual was employed. The question then arises whether the employer and employee can establish the regular rate by contract. The parties agree that as long as the agreement does not involve fluctuation in the amount of hours worked, it must be assumed that both parties intend to guarantee the same weekly wage. They argue that this arrangement is inconsistent because the intention to make the monthly wage equal or exceed the actual weekly wage cannot be so easily determined. Finally, the Court decides that the pre-payment plan is lawful but that the standard rate is too high.",1942-06-08,1.0

In this case, the Court decides that the contract must contain a specific amount of time and one half of the regular rate required by the law. This means that employers may not be allowed to contract with their employees at hourly or weekly rates without complying with the requirements of the Fair Labor Standard Act. However, the courts do not believe that these contracts are necessarily limited only by salary. Instead, they are bound to meet certain requirements. For example, Missel's contract contains both hourly and fixed-weekly wage contracts. If the employer wants to hire a worker who works more than 54% hours per week, the employer must pay the employee a flat rate. But if the employee cannot work more than five4% hours, then the employer will have to pay extra money. Therefore, the owner of the factory would have to make up for the fact that the employee has to work beyond the agreed-upon number of hours to earn the full weekly wage.

The jury found petitioners guilty of seven counts of conspiracy, each charged with violating a separate section of the criminal code. On the trial, there was evidence that petitioners, along with others, conspired to manufacture, distribute, transport, and distribute distilled spirits. At the end of the trial however, petitioners asked the government to elect one count of the seven-count charge because it could not and didn't establish more than One agreement. The Government's attorney countered that the count of seven would be sufficient to convict the petitioners as ""guilties as charged."" The court ruled that only he or she committed the offenses they were accused of. However, both courts disagreed that a singular agreement to commit a crime does not become multiple conspiracieses; rather, it continues over an extended period of time. Both courts have held that single agreements to commit crimes do not become many but are simply part of a larger conspiracy. For example, Bannon had previously argued that if a single contract is entered into, then the conspirators may be guilty of all kinds of offenses as long as the agreement contains criminal objects. But here, the court has decided that even when a particular agreement is signed, the individual who commits the crime cannot be punished by the same punishment as the other party. Thus, although the specific nature of the conspiracy depends on the agreement which defines its object, the fact that such an agreement exists doesn't mean that the whole thing is a fraud. It means that the entire deal is different from successive acts that violate a similar piece of legislation. Therefore, since the single agreement embraces itscriminal objects, it also differs from subsequent acts which violate another law.

He also asserts that if a person does not return all of the money in terms of political contributions, it would be evidence of his willful attempt to deceive the government. The court dismisses petitioner's crossexamination as improper because it bore directly onto credibility. However, counsel for petitioner advises him that his constitutional privilege may be invoked when asked questions are asked about the number of dollars he received during the previous year. The trial concludes with an exception. On the morning of the trial, the court declares that there were many other matters referred last night but decides that they should reconsider. The next day, the jury makes several objections to the prosecuting statement that the claims of privilege could only be considered incriminating. They do not deny the charge; however, the Court considers the question of whether petitioner has received any money from the figures game during November andDecember 1937. It is clear that the charges against him relate to the amount of money withdrawn from the numbers-gaming company during those two months. In addition, the fact that petitioner failed to report the money indicates that unless he did indeed receive the money, he would likely be accused of evading the tax. If the court grants claim of privilege without giving the accused the opportunity to make a choice between granting or refusing the privilege, the accuser might well be disloyal.",1943-03-15,1.0

Mr. Justice Frankfurter,
concurring:
In reviewing criminal cases, it is particularly important for appellate courts to re-live the whole trial imaginatively and not to extract from episodes in isolation abstract questions of evidence and procedure. To turn a criminal appeal into a quest for error no more promotes the ends of justice than to acquiesce in low standards of criminal prosecution.
An examination of the entire record of the proceedings leaves me without doubt that Judge Maris conducted the trial with conspicuous fairness, and that he committed no error in the rulings complained of unless it be one in favor of the defendant. In allowing the defendant to withhold testimony regarding gambling receipts for 1938, the trial court, in recognizing the threat of future prosecution of the defendant for evading taxes in that year, was exercising a merciful discretion. For this avenue of inquiry plainly was relevant to the truth of the charges against Johnson in the present proceeding. In view of all that took place at the trial, to have denied the jury an opportunity to consider the significance of the defendant’s desire not to testify regarding gambling receipts in 1938 would have been to withhold from them a factor relevant-in determining whether Johnson’s explanation of what he did with the “protection” money received by him in 1936 and 1937 was the truth or just a cock-and-bull story.
*203That the defendant’s senior counsel, a lawyer of long experience in federal criminal practice, did not take exception to the manner in which Judge Maris tempered concern for the proper administration of justice with solicitude for the rights of the defendant, indicates not “waiver” of a right which had been denied but recognition that the action of the trial judge was unexceptionable. The claim that the trial was conducted improperly is obviously an afterthought. Only after conviction and in an effort to upset the jury’s verdict on appeal was the fair conduct of the trial court sought to be distorted into an impropriety.

The taxpayer, Sabine Transportation Co., Inc., is a Delaware corporation doing business in Texas. Its stock is held in equal amounts by two other corporations, Sabine Towing Co., Inc., and The Pure Oil Corporation. In 1937, a dividend of $53Q,000.00 was declared, amounting to $35.33% per share on the common stock. The dividend was paid to the two corporate owners by execution of ten year, eight per cent notes. The taxpayer then claimed and was allowed a “dividend paid credit” under the 1936 Act on its 1937 tax. In 1938 the taxpayer paid to its two corporate stockholders the full face value of the ten year notes. It is now given a second “dividends paid credit” under the 1938 Act on its 1938 tax.
This $530,000.00 has left the corporate treasury only once. Bookkeeping devices and paper contrivances should not be permitted to make two payments out of one; and if two deductions are permitted, why not three or more? The possibilities of manipulation of notes, bonds, stocks, and every other cash substitute imaginable, are particularly apparent when, as here, the taxpayer and its stockholders are so closely interrelated. Congress has passed no tax statutes which compel me to conclude that it intended to reward ingenuity in paper work by granting multiple tax reductions for a single money payment to discharge a single corporate obligation.

  After we denied, without prejudice, petitioner’s previous application for leave to file in this Court a petition for habeas corpus, 317 U.

Petitioner now alleges that he has filed an appeal from that court to the Supreme Court of Indiana. He also alleges that his request that a transcript of the coram nobis proceeding be furnished free of charge, because he is a poor person, has been denied. He contends that in the absence of a transcript of the coram nobis proceeding, he is left without a remedy by appeal in the courts of Indiana. But we cannot assume that the Supreme Court of Indiana will refuse to use its process to bring before it such parts of the record as may be necessary for a decision of the case, or that, in that event, it will refuse to enter an order finally disposing of the appeal. Until the Supreme Court of Indiana has acted upon an application for an order finally disposing of the appeal — which, if adverse to petitioner, he could make the subject of a petition for certiorari to this Court — the remedies afforded by state appellate procedure have not been fully exhausted.

On the same day, that court sent to the Superior Court from which the appeal was taken a rescript which contained the following order: “Ordered, that the clerk of said court . . . make the following entry under said case in the docket of said court: viz., Final Decree to be modified by the insertion of a clause to the effect that the
   
   *582
   
  bill is dismissed on the ground that the questions raised have become moot; decree as so modified is affirmed with costs.” The rescript was filed that day in the Superior Court, which, on January 7, 1943, entered a decree as had been directed.
 

  Applications for the allowance of an appeal to this Court, presented within three months after December 4th, were denied by the Chief Justice of the Superior Court of Massachusetts and by an Associate Justice of this Court. An application presented to another Associate Justice on March 6th was allowed. But this last application was not timely if the time to take an appeal ran from December 4th.

I concur in the Court’s opinion, except for the suggestion, if that is intended (as to which I make no assertion), that the courts have no power to review any action a military officer may “in his discretion” find it necessary to take with respect to civilian citizens in military areas or zones, once it is found that an emergency has created the conditions requiring or justifying the creation of the area or zone and the institution of some degree of military control short of suspending habeas corpus. Given the generating conditions for exercise of military authority and recognizing the wide latitude for particular applications that ordinarily creates, I do not think it is necessary in this case to decide that there is no action a person in the position of General DeWitt here may take, and which he may regard as necessary to the region’s or the country’s safety, which will call judicial power into play. The officer of course must have wide discretion and room for its operation. But it does not follow there may not be bounds beyond which he cannot go and, if he oversteps them, that the courts may not have power to protect the civilian citizen. But in this case that question need not be faced and I merely add my reservation without indication of opinion concerning it.

dissenting:
The Tax Court applied the correct rule of law in determining whether the gifts to charity were so uncertain as to disallow their deduction. That rule is that the deduction may be made if on the facts presented the amount of the charitable gifts are affected by “no uncertainty appreciably greater than the general uncertainty that attends human affairs.” Ithaca Trust Co. v. United States, 279 U. S. 151, 154. In that event the standard fixed by the will is “capable of being stated in definite terms of money.” Id., p. 154. The mere possibility of invasion of the corpus is not enough to defeat the deduction. The *264.Tax Court applied that test to these facts. 45 B. T. A. 270, 273-274. Where its findings are supported by substantial evidence they are conclusive. We may modify or reverse such a decision only if it is “not in accordance with law.” 44 Stat. 110, 26 U. S. C. § 1141 (c) (i). See Wilmington Trust Co. v. Helvering, 316 U. S. 164, 168. The discretion to pay to the wife such principal amounts as the trustee deems proper for her “happiness” introduces of course an element of uncertainty beyond that which existed in the Ithaca Trust Co. case. There the trustee only had authority to withdraw from the principal and pay to the wife a sum “necessary to suitably maintain her in as much comfort as she now enjoys.” But the frugality and conservatism of this New England corporate trustee, the habits and temperament of this sixty-seven year old lady, her scale of living, the nature of the investments — these facts might well make certain what on the face of the will might appear quite uncertain. We should let that factual determination of the Tax Court stand, even though we would decide differently were we the triers of fact.

By MR. Justice Jackson:
I concur with the opinion of the Ci-iief Justice.
If the Court were to reconsider Williams v. North Carolina, 317 U. S. 287, in the light of the views expressed by Mr. Justice Black, I should adhere to the views I expressed in dissent there. Until we do so, I consider myself bound by that decision. Whatever might be the law if that case had never been decided, I am unable to see why the controlling principles it announced under the full faith and credit clause to reverse the North Carolina decision therein do not require reversal of the Louisiana decision under review. I agree with the dissent that Louisiana has a legitimate interest to protect in the subject matter of this litigation, but so did North Carolina in the Williams case. I am unable to see how Louisiana can be constitutionally free to apply its own workmen’s compensation law to its citizens despite a previous adjudication in another state if North Carolina was not free to apply its own matrimonial policy to its own citizens after judgment on the subject in Nevada. Is Louisiana’s social interest in seeing that its labor contracts carry adequate workmen’s compensation superior constitutionally to North Carolina’s interest in seeing that people who contract marriage there are protected in the rights they acquire? It is true that someone might have to take care of the Louisiana citizen who is injured but inadequately compensated in Texas, as it was true in the Williams case that someone might have to care for those deprived of their marriage status by the foreign divorce decree.
*447Overruling a precedent always introduces some confusion and the necessity for it may be unfortunate. But it is as nothing to keeping on our books utterances to which we ourselves will give full faith and credit only if the outcome pleases us. I shall abide by the Williams case until it is taken off our books, and for that reason concur in the decision herein.

I concur in the result and in the opinion of the Court except in one respect. Petitioner claims the local board’s order of classification was invalid because that board refused to classify petitioner as a minister on the basis of an antipathy to the religious sect of which he is a member. And, if the question were open, the record discloses that some evidence tendered to sustain this charge was excluded in the trial court. But petitioner has made no such charge concerning the action of the appeal board which reviewed and affirmed the local board’s order. And there is nothing to show that the appeal board acted otherwise than according to law. If therefore the local board’s order was invalid originally for the reason claimed, as to which I express no opinion, whatever defect may have existed was cured by the appeal board’s action. Apart from some challenge upon constitutional grounds, I have no doubt that Congress could and did exclude judicial review of Selective Service orders like that in question.

The question is whether the company is a ""personal holding company"" within the definition of the revenue act. The answer is negative. The penalty for not filing was 25 percent. The president who executed the returns did not do so because he believed the company was not merely a personalholding company within the term of the Act; it was actively engaged at the pawney shop business. The court affirmed the penalty but denied the petition for reconsideration. However, in February 1943, a dispute developed between the courts. Petitioner sought leave to file a petition after the expiration date of the 25 day period allowed by the rule in which we had granted petition for review. On June 7th, we granted permission to grant rehearsing. We also asked counsel about the provisions dealing with when the decision of either the Board or the Supreme Court becomes final. Section 1141 of the internal revenue code states that the decision shall become final upon any appeal or on the expirations of 30 days since the decision became final. This provision does not apply to cases where the board's decisions are modified or dismissed by the circuit court or the supreme court.

I can find no warrant in § 1140 of the Internal Revenue Code for saying that the decision of the Tax Court becomes “final” only after the expiration of the 25-day period within which a petition for rehearing may be filed. The section contains no such provision. The 25-day period for rehearings is prescribed by our Rule 33. But our authority to grant petitions for rehearing during the Term rises from the same source. See Wayne United Gas Co. v. Owens-Illinois Glass Co., 300 U. S. 131, 136-137; Art Metal Construction Co. v. United States, 289 U. S. 706; Bronson v. Schulten, 104 U. S. 410, 415. Hence I see no basis for saying that one, but not the other, qualifies that provision of § 1140 which states that the decision of the Tax Court becomes final “upon denial of a petition for certiorari.”

  Mr. Justice Jackson
 

  delivered the opinion of the Court.
 

  Petition for rehearing in two of the four cases decided together on December 20,1943 states that these contained an issue not present and not considered in the main case. In these two cases the Tax Court held that recoveries by these taxpayers in 1939 did constitute taxable income. It held, also, that the recovery was taxable as ordinary income, despite taxpayer’s contention that it should be taxed as capital gain under § 117 of the Internal Revenue Code. This contention, the petition says, presents questions of law to be determined by this Court, rather than of fact finally to be determined by the Tax Court.
 

  The weakness of taxpayers’ position lies in the fact that not every gain growing out of a transaction concerning
   
   *232
   
  capital assets is allowed the benefits of the capital gains tax provision. Those are limited by definition to gains from “the sale or exchange” of capital assets. Internal Revenue Code § 117 (2), (3), (4), (5).
 

  We certainly cannot say that the items in question were as matter of law proceeds of the “sale or exchange” of a capital asset. Harwick asserted a claim, and the three other taxpayers involved in these cases filed suit, against the National City Company, demanding rescission of their purchases of stock. Their claims were compromised or admitted; the taxpayers seek to link the recoveries resulting therefrom with their prior sales of the stock, which resulted in losses. The Tax Court did not find as matter of fact, and we decline to say as matter of law, that such a transaction is a “sale or exchange” of a capital asset-in the accepted meaning of those terms. Cf.

It is an appeal to the Judician because of the fact that the state court has rested its judgment and judgment on two independent grounds but only one error assigned by appellant as error. The question here is whether the district court's decision and judgment are supported by two independent reasons, each sufficient to support the other. In this case, Appels, children, and sole delegates of Wiener were brought before the Louisiana District Court to collect their inheritance tax. They had been asked to pay the entire estate tax in order to avoid being subjected to the same tax as the decedent. Both courts disagreed with them; however, they held that the federal law did not violate the due process guaranteeing uniformity under the Article I Constitution. On appeal, the Attorney General was allowed to argue that the constitution does not rest upon the validity of Congress's Act No.119. However, the State Supreme Court ruled that the act violated the Fifth Amendment since it ""imposes the taxes on property not belong to decedent or acquired by afflicted spouses under the Will."" Thus, the argument presented by the Appellant is that the Louisiana statute violates the fifth amendment because it imposes a burden on all those who share in the community property. Therefore, even though the claim made by the petitioners against the Louisiana legislature is limited to the issue of how much the tax should be imposed, there is no doubt that the Texas government cannot impose the entire burden on these people.",1944-02-28,1.0

If the Supreme Court cannot find a valid state statute, then the case could come before the Court only if there is an assignment of error. However, if the appeal is dismissed, the case will still have to go to the Louisiana State Supreme Court.

Although the Court has held that there can be some situations in which individuals cannot enter into individual deals, such as during a period of time when no collective bargaining exists, the courts have taken care to hold that ""individual contracts may not be available to defeat or delays the procedures prescribedby the National Labor relations Act.""

My understanding of this Court’s opinions in Murdock v. Pennsylvania, 319 U. S. 105, and Jones v. Opelika, 319 U.

These opinions are now the law of the land.
As I see no difference in respect to the exercise of religion between an itinerant distributor and one who remains in one general neighborhood or between one who is active part time and another who is active all of his time, there is no occasion for me to state again views already rejected by a majority of the Court.

On June 5, 1941 she was traveling in her automobile when she came upon a road that would likely have led her to her mother's house. She was found dead on her head and Petitioner William Ashcraft was tried and convicted of the crime. Both were charged with having employed Ware to execute the murder. The trial court did not believe their confessions were ""freely and voluntary made."" However, the state Supreme Court held that they were ""solely and solely made."" This decision is supported by the fact that both are sentenced to 9ty-Nine years in penitentiary. Although neither party denies any involvement in the crime, it is clear that these two men had no intention of confessing. It is furthermore determined that they must be adamant that they do not commit the crime because they fear punishment or hope for reward.

Finally, we begin to examine the case of Ashcraft: He was born an Arkansas farm; at age eleven he became a farmer; and later became able to become a dragline and Steam Shovel operator. After his wife's death, Ashcraft began working as a laborer. His earnings were modest enough to allow him to live comfortably.

The legal question on the record before us lies within a narrow compass. Section 7 of the Fair Labor Standards Act commands the payment of compensation at a rate of not less than one and one-half times the regular rate for every employee under the statute who is engaged “for a workweek” longer than forty-four or forty-two hours during the first or the second year, respectively, after the effective date of the section and forty hours thereafter. 52 Stat. 1060, 1063, 29 U. S. C. § 207. Congress did not explicitly define “workweek” and there is nothing in the available materials pertinent to construction that warrants a finding that “workweek,” as applied to the workers in the iron ore industry, had so settled a *604meaning at the time of the enactment of the Fair Labor Standards Act as to be deemed incorporated by reference. As a result, “workweek” in this statute, as applied to workers in this industry and on this record, has no technical meaning, that is, a meaning so well known to those in this particular industry as to be applied by courts in enforcing the statute when invoked by men in the industry. For purposes of this case, in any event, when Congress used the word “workweek,” it used it colloquially— the term carries merely the meaning of common understanding.
An administrative agency for preliminary adjudication of issues arising under the Wages and Hours Law, like that established by the National Labor Relations Act, was not provided by Congress. And so, the application of this colloquial concept “workweek” to the multifarious situations in American industry was left by Congress for ascertainment by judicial proceedings. These facts are to be found either by a jury or, as in this case, by a judge sitting without a jury. And so here it was the judge’s duty to determine what time and energy on the part of the employees involved in this suit constituted a “workweek” of these employees of the petitioners. After a trial which lasted for about three weeks, during which testimony covering 2,643 pages was heard and voluminous exhibits were introduced, the District Court made its findings of fact. A judgment for the employees based on these findings was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 40 F. Supp.4; 135 F. 2d 320.
We have then a judgment of two courts based on findings with ample evidence to warrant such findings. Affirmance by this Court is therefore demanded.

  v.
  
   United States, post,
  
  p. 634. When Cornell attacked the Commission’s order in the District Court, Boston again intervened. 53 F. Supp. 349. Its petition for intervention, granted by the District Court, alleged that it operated tugboats in and about Boston harbor which rendered services somewhat similar to those rendered by Cornell in New York harbor; that Division 4 of the Commission had held it, Boston, covered by the Act; that it was aggrieved by the Commission’s decision against Cornell “insofar as said decision holds that towers for hire are carriers and subject to the terms and provisions of Part III of the Interstate Commerce Act”; and that it desired to participate in the District Court proceedings “solely for the purpose of asserting ... its said contentions regarding such jurisdictional issue.” Boston’s petition did not allege, and the record fails to show, that it had any financial interest in Cornell, or was engaged in competition with Cornell, or that its interests would be adversely affected by a decision against Cornell except insofar as that decision might establish a precedent holding tugboats subject to the Commission’s jurisdiction under Part III of the Interstate Commerce Act. Boston’s brief in this Court asserts that it has pending in the District Court for the District of Massachusetts a suit to enjoin and set aside the Commission’s order holding Boston covered by the Act. In its brief Boston expressly seeks to reserve the right to contend in the Massachusetts proceeding “that the facts underlying its own towing operations are such as to bring the question of its status outside the scope of that of a carrier.”
 

  We are of opinion that Boston’s interest in the outcome of the Cornell litigation is insufficient to entitle it to take a separate appeal. See Judicial Code, §§ 210, 212, as
   
   *634
   
  amended, 28 U. S. C. §§ 47a, 45a. Whether Boston had sufficient interest to intervene as of right before the Commission and in the District Court we need not decide, the issue here being only whether Boston has such an “independent right which is violated” by the decision against Cornell as will support an independent appeal.

Mr. Justice Reed :
As I understand McNabb v. United States, 318 U. S. 332, as explained by the Court’s opinion of today, the McNabb rule is that where there has been illegal detention of a prisoner, joined with other circumstances which are deemed by this Court to be contrary to proper conduct of federal prosecutions, the confession will not be admitted. Further, this refusal of admission is required even though the detention plus the conduct do not together amount to duress or coercion. If the above understanding is correct, it is for me a desirable modification of the McNabb case.
However, even as explained I do not agree that the rule works a wise change in federal procedure.
In my view detention without commitment is only one factor for consideration in reaching a conclusion as to whether or not a confession is voluntary. The juristic theory under which a confession should be admitted or barred is bottomed on the testimonial trustworthiness of the confession. If the confession is freely made without inducement or menace, it is admissible. If otherwise made, it is not, for if brought about by false promises or real threats, it has no weight as proper proof of guilt. Wan v. United States, 266 U. S. 1, 14; Wilson v. United States, 162 U. S. 613, 622; 3 Wigmore Evidence (1940 Ed.) § 882.

Mr. Justice Jackson,
dissenting:
This decision authorizes in my opinion an unwarranted extension of the power of a state to subject persons to its taxing power who' are not within its jurisdiction and have not in any manner submitted themselves to it. The General Trading Company is, in the language of the opinion, made “the tax collector for the State.” We have heretofore held, and I think properly, that the state may make tax collectors of those who come in and do business within its jurisdiction, for thereby they submit themselves to its power. Such was the situation in both Monamotor Oil Co. v. Johnson, 292 U. S. 86, and Felt & Tarrant Mfg. Co. v. Gallagher, 306 U. S. 62. These are the only authorities cited by the Court on this point, and they clearly are not precedents to support this decision.
In this case, as the opinion points out, the General Trading Company never qualified in Iowa and has no office, branch, warehouse, or general agent in the State. From Minnesota it ships goods ordered from salesmen by purchasers in Iowa. Orders are accepted only in Minnesota. The transaction of sale is not taxed and, being clearly interstate commerce, is not taxable. McLeod v. Dilworth Co., ante, p. 327. So we are holding that a state has power to make a tax collector of one whom it has no power to tax. Certainly no state has a constitutional warrant for making a tax collector of one as the price of the privilege of doing interstate commerce. He does not get the right from the state, and the state cannot qualify it. I can imagine no principle of states’ rights or state comity which can justify what is done here. *340Nor does the practice seem conducive to good order in the federal system. The power of Iowa to enforce collection in other states is certainly very limited and the effort to do so on any wide scale is unlikely either to be systematically pursued or successfully executed.
I recognize the pressure to uphold all manner of efforts to collect tax moneys. But this decision, by which one may not ship goods from anywhere in the United States to a purchaser in Iowa without becoming a nonresident tax collector, exceeds everything so far done by this Court. In my opinion the statute is an effort to exert extraterritorial control beyond any which a state could exert if there were no Constitution at all. I can think of nothing in or out of the Constitution which warrants this effort to reach beyond the State’s o^wn border to make out-of-state merchants tax collectors because they engage in interstate commerce with the State’s citizens.

Mr. Justice Douglas:
I would decide this case differently. I think this decision and Vinson v. Washington Gas Light Co., 321 U. S. 489, pretty well emasculate the provision of the Act of October 2, 1942 (56 Stat. 765) which prohibits “any general increase” in utility rates unless notice is given to the federal agency in charge of inflation control and that agency is allowed to intervene in the proceedings. As I stated in my dissent in Vinson v. Washington Gas Light Co., supra, Congress intended by that provision that there should be as great an accommodation as possible between established standards for rate-making and existing wartime necessities. General rate increases were not to be allowed unless, for example, it was shown that they were necessary to preserve existing facilities under war conditions. I agree with Judge McLaughlin and Judge Meaney of the three-judge court that this emergency legislation *525required the Commission “to give full effect to wartime conditions and the stabilization legislation.” It was that policy which was reflected in Executive Order 9328 promulgated by the President on April 8, 1943 (8 Fed. Reg. 4681,4682) and providing as follows:
“The attention of all agencies of the Federal Government, and of all State and municipal authorities, concerned with the rates of common carriers or other public utilities, is directed to the stabilization program of which this order is a part so that rate increases will be disapproved and rate reductions effected, consistently with the Act of October 2, 1942, and other applicable federal, state or municipal law, in order to keep down the cost of living arid effectuate the purposes of the stabilization program.”
That policy is once more disregarded. The Interstate Commerce Commission proceeds to grant rate increases on the basis of peacetime standards. It justifies the increase under the Act of October 2, 1942, by saying that the increase per consumer is negligible. By the same token every item in the list of consumer necessities could be increased a like percentage. What was negligible item by item would soon be substantial in the aggregate. That which first appears as a small trickle may eventually undermine the dam.
But though I disagree with the result reached, I think it is precisely what Vinson v. Washington Gas Light Co. intended. That case and Davies Warehouse Co. v. Bowles, 321 U. S. 144, give preferred treatment to a few businesses by allowing them to gain advantages from war conditions. I would overrule them. But so long as they stand I do not see how we can deny the Interstate Commerce Commission the power to do for the Hudson & Manhattan Railroad Co. what another commission was allowed to do for the Washington Gas Light Co.

I join in the per curiam on the assumption that after the Court of'Appeals will have disposed of all issues to be decided by local District of Columbia law nothing will be left in the certified question for this Court to answer.
This is a suit for a lawyer’s fee, that is, an ordinary District of Columbia common law action of debt and not one to enforce “a substantive right existing under the Constitution or laws of the United States.” For, I take it, in allowing an unincorporated association to be sued “in its common name for the purpose of enforcing . . . a substantive right existing under the . . . laws of the United States,” Rule 17 (b) of the Rules of Civil Procedure referred to laws of general applicability throughout the United States and not to the body of local law governing the District of Columbia. Therefore, suability of an unincorporated labor union is a local procedural problem to be determined, according to Rule 17 (b) in conjunction with Rule 81 (e), by the local law of the District. That “the suability of trades unions ... is after all in essence and principle merely a procedural matter” is vouched for by the Coronado case, 259 U. S. 344, 390, the scope of which has been authoritatively defined in Brown v. United States, 276 U. S. 134, 141 and Moffat Tunnel League v. United States, 289 U. S. 113, 118. Since substantive rights were outside the authority given by Congress for prescribing rules of civil procedure, Rule 17 (b) and the note thereto by the Advisory Committee on Rules, by dealing with capacity to sue or be sued, decisively confirm the *77statement in the Coronado case that the suability of a trade union is a procedural matter.
But if such a procedural matter may be cast in the form of a substantive issue for the determination of status, it would, in this case in any event, be a question of the substantive law of the District and not raise any substantive issue of federal law. If a suit like this were brought in the District Court for the Southern District of New York under diversity jurisdiction, no conceivable question other than that of the procedural or substantive law of the State of New York could arise. No federal question is infused into the litigation because such a local suit was brought in the District of Columbia.
In view of the increase in the volume and the complexity of the business that is coming to this Court, and the bearing of this increase upon the proper discharge of its work (see Ex parte Peru, 318 U.

I concur in the result, but I think that the judgment of the North Carolina court was entitled to faith and *87credit in Tennessee even if it was not a final one. On this assumption I do not find it necessary or relevant to examine North Carolina law as to whether its judgment might under some hypothetical circumstances be modified.
Neither the full faith and credit clause of the Constitution nor the Act of Congress implementing it says anything about final judgments or, for that matter, about any judgments. Both require that full faith and credit be given to “judicial proceedings” without limitation as to finality. Upon recognition of the broad meaning of that term much may some day depend.
Whatever else this North Carolina document might be, no one denies that it is a step in a judicial proceeding, instituted validly under the strictest standards of due process. On its face it is final and by its terms it awards a money judgment in a liquidated amount, presently collectible and provides “that execution issue therefor.” Tennessee should have rendered substantially the same judgment that it received from the courts of North Carolina. If later a decree is made in North Carolina which modifies or amends its judgment, that modification or amendment will also be entitled to faith and credit in Tennessee.
Of course a judgment is entitled to faith and credit for just what it is, and no more. But its own terms constitute a determination by the rendering court as to what it is, and an enforcing court may not search the laws of the state to see whether the judgment terms are erroneous. Of course, if a judgment by its terms reserves power to modify or states conditions, a judgment entered upon jt could appropriately make like reservations or conditions. No such appear in this judgment unless they are to be annexed to it by a study of the law of North Carolina. Any application for such relief should be addressed to the North Carolina court and not to the Tennessee *88court nor to this one. The purpose of the full faith and credit clause is to lengthen the arm of the state court and to eliminate state lines as a shelter from judicial proceedings. This is defeated by entertaining a plea to review the support in state law for the judgment as it has been rendered, which is a delaying inquiry as has been shown by this case.

I hardly think we would set this conviction aside if the collecting bank instead of cashing the checks took them for collection only and refused to pay the defendants until the checks had been honored by the drawee. It js plain *96that the mails would then be used to obtain the fruits of the fraud. And I do not see why the fraud fails to become a federal offense merely because the collecting bank cashes the checks. That would seem to be irrelevant under these circumstances. As pointed out in Decker v. United States, 140 F. 2d 378, 379, the object of the scheme was to defraud Triumph; and the use of the mails was an essential step to that end. It js true that the collecting bank was a holder in due course against whom the drawer had no defense. But that does not mean that the fraudulent scheme had reached fruition at that point of time. Yet if legal technicalities rather than practical considerations are to decide that question it should be noted that the defendants were payee-indorsers of the checks. They had received only a conditional credit, or payment as the case may be. It took payment by the drawee to discharge them from their liability as indorsers. Not until then would the defendants receive irrevocably the proceeds of their fraud.
Moreover, this was not the last step in the fraudulent scheme. It was a continuing venture. Smooth clearances of the checks were essential lest these intermediate dividends be interrupted and the conspirators be called upon to disgorge. Different considerations would be applicable if we were dealing with incidental mailings. But we are not. To obtain money was the sole object of this fraud. The use of the mails was crucial to the total success of the fraudulent project. We are not justified in chopping up the vital banking phase of the scheme into segments and isolating one part from the others. That would be warranted if the scheme were to defraud the collecting bank. But it is plain that these plans had a wider reach and that but for the use of the mails they would not have been finally consummated.

Mr. Justice Murphy,
concurring.
The economic discrimination against Negroes practiced by the Brotherhood and the railroad under color of Congressional authority raises a grave constitutional issue that should be squarely faced.
The utter disregard for the dignity and the well-being of colored citizens shown by this record is so pronounced as to demand the invocation of constitutional condemnation. To decide the case and to analyze the statute solely upon the basis of legal niceties,' while remaining mute and placid as to the obvious and oppressive deprivation of constitutional guarantees, is to make the judicial function something less than it should be.
The constitutional problem inherent in this instance is clear. Congress, through the Railway Labor Act, has conferred upon the union selected by a majority of a craft or class of railway workers the power to represent the entire craft or class in all collective bargaining matters. While such a union is essentially a private organization, its power to represent and bind all members of a class or craft is derived solely from Congress. The Act contains no language which directs the manner in which the bargaining representative shall perform its duties. But it cannot be assumed that Congress meant to authorize the representative to act so as to ignore rights guaranteed by-the Constitution. Otherwise the Act would bear the stigma of unconstitutionality under the Fifth Amendment in this respect. For that reason I am willing to read the statute as not permitting or allowing any actidn by the *209bargaining representative in the exercise of its delegated powers which would in effect- violate the constitutional rights of individuals.
If the Court’s construction of. the statute rests upon this basis, I agree. But I am not sure that such is the basis. Suffice it to say, however, that this constitutional issue cannot be lightly dismissed. The cloak of racism surrounding the actions of the Brotherhood in refusing membership to Negroes and in entering into and enforcing agreements discriminating against them, all under the guise of Congressional authority, still remains. No statutory interpretation can erase this ugly example of economic cruelty against colored citizens of the United States. Nothing can destroy the fact that the accident of birth has been used as the basis to abuse individual rights by an organization purporting to act in conformity with its Congressional mandate. Any attempt to interpret the Act must take that fact into account and must realize that the constitutionality of the statute in this respect depends upon the answer given.
The Constitution voices its disapproval whenever economic discrimination is applied under authority of law against any race, creed or color. A sound democracy cannot allow such discrimination to go unchallenged. Racism is far too virulent today to permit the slightest refusal, in the light of a Constitution that abhors it, to expose and condemn it wherever it appears in the course of a statutory interpretation.

Mr. Justice Murphy,

I join in the opinion of the Court, but I am of the view that detention in Relocation Centers of persons of Japanese ancestry regardless of loyalty is not only unauthorized by Congress or the Executive but is another example of the unconstitutional resort to racism inherent in the entire evacuation program. As stated more fully in my *308dissenting opinion in Korematsu v. United States, ante, p. 233, racial discrimination of this nature bears no reasonable relation to military necessity and is utterly foreign to the ideals and traditions of the American people.
Moreover, the Court holds that Mitsuye Endo is entitled to an unconditional release by the War Relocation Authority. It appears that Miss Endo desires to return to Sacramento, California, from which Public Proclamations Nos. 7 and 11, as well as Civilian Exclusion Order No. 52, still exclude her. And it would seem to me that the “unconditional” release to be given Miss Endo necessarily implies “the right to pass freely from state to state,” including the right to move freely into California. Twining v. New Jersey, 211 U. S. 78, 97; Crandall v. Nevada, 6 Wall. 35. If, as I believe, the military orders excluding her from California were invalid at the time they were issued, they are increasingly objectionable at this late date, when the threat of invasion of the Pacific Coast and the fears of sabotage and espionage have greatly diminished. For the Government to suggest under these circumstances that the presence of Japanese blood in a loyal American citizen might be enough to warrant her exclusion from a place where she would otherwise have a right to go is a position I cannot sanction.

   *326
   
  Like that case the present suit was brought by appellant against Federal Laboratories, Inc. and Breeze Corporations, Inc. to secure among other things an adjudication of the constitutional validity of the Royalty Adjustment Act of Congress of October 31, 1942, 56 Stat. 1013, 35 U. S. C. Supp. III, §§ 89-96. It sought also to enjoin defendants from paying over to the Treasury of the United States royalties alleged to be due upon the license agreements involved in the Breeze suit, as required by the notices and orders of the War and Navy Departments served upon appellant and the defendants pursuant to the Act.
 

  In addition, the bill of complaint alleges that the defendants owe royalties to appellant under the license agreements, for which it prays an accounting. By way of anticipation of the defense that the Royalty Adjustment-Act and the notices and orders of the War and Navy Departments require appellee to pay the royalties into the Treasury, appellant sets up the unconstitutionality of the Act.
 

  A district court of three judges was convened to hear the cause as required by the Act of August 24, 1937, 50 Stat. 752, 28 U. S. C. § 380 (a), and the United States was allowed to intervene as a party in accordance with § 1 of the Act. 50 Stat. 751, 28 U. S. C. § 401. The District Court, on motion of the Government, dismissed so much of the bill of complaint as sought an adjudication of the constitutional validity of the Royalty Adjustment Act and of the notice and orders issued under it. It struck from the bill of complaint the anticipatory allegations that the Royalty Adjustment Act and the orders with respect to the royalties owing appellant are unconstitutional and void, and it struck the prayer of the bill for an injunction.
 

  For the reasons stated in our opinion in the
  
   Breeze
  
  case we hold that appellant has shown no ground for equitable relief by way of injunction. The allegations of unconstitutionality of the Royalty Adjustment Act and the orders were pleaded only as supporting the prayer for an
   
   *327
   
  injunction and were therefore properly stricken with that prayer. The allegations are not essential to or a proper part of the cause of action for an accounting and recovery of the royalties alleged to be due.
 

  Since the allegations were stricken, appellee Federal has answered setting up as a separate defense the royalty adjustment orders prohibiting payment of the royalties to appellant. Upon that issue appellant will be free to contest the constitutional validity of the orders. The judgment below is accordingly

The District Court found that this trust was “intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after”- the death of the decedent. The Circuit Court of Appeals agreed. Certiorari was not granted on that question but only on the question whether the entire value of the corpus of the trust at the time of decedent’s death should be included in her gross estate. So in this case, as in Commissioner v. Estate of Field, post, p. 113, we are *113not faced with the question whether May v. Heiner, 281 U. S. 238, should survive Helvering v. Hallock, 309 U. S. 106. On the findings of the District Court, it is plain that the entire corpus must be included in decedent’s gross estate by virtue of § 302 (c) of the 1926 Act unless the value of the life estate must be deducted. The value of the life estate deducted in the Hallock case was the life estate in the settlor’s wife. It was excluded because it took effect in possession or enjoyment when the trust was created. The life estate which the decedent reserved to herself is obviously in a different category. It is not an “outstanding life estate” within the meaning of Treasury Regulations 80, Art. 17.

If the trust gave a life estate to the decedent and the remainder to his children, § 302 (c) of the 1926 Act would not require the payment of a tax under the rule of May v. Heiner, 281 U.

Heiner was that under those circumstances no interest in the property passed from the grantor to the remainder-man on the grantor’s death, since the title of the remain-derman had been definitely fixed by the trust deed. We need not determine whether the rule of May v. Heiner should survive Helvering v. Hallock, 309 U. S. 106. See Paul, Federal Estate & Gift Taxation (1942) § 7.15. For *117in this case the grantor retained the right to reduce or cancel by will or written instrument the interests of the children; and the corpus would have been returned to the grantor if he survived his nieces.

3645,9419625,104116,020lead,"In this case, Douglas argues that the Federal Power Commission has violated the provisions of Chapter 5 of the Act by ordering interstate wholesale prices to be excessive. The petitioners are Canadian and Colorado-Illiams, who have been selling natural gas from an agreement made between Southwestern development company, Standard Oil Company, and Cities service company. They argue that the commission should not separate the physical properties used in the interstate or interstate business because it would result in too much expense for the entire enterprise. Although the federal government does not explicitly state how the rate is calculated, the court disagrees with the method used by the commission. It finds that the cost of each type of business is divided into three classes: ""volumetric,"" ""capacity,"" and ""distribution."" Costs related to the production process are divided into two classes: volumetric costs and capacity expenses. The largest portion of the revenue comes from the direct industrial business. Because the customers do not use the system at all, the distribution costs are proportionate to the amount of product sold to each customer; the larger portion of those costs come from the transportation costs. If the customers were using the system during the peak day, they would pay more than the price ordered by the comision. However, since the reduction orders were based on only the excess of revenue over costs, there would no difference in results. This means that when a company makes a higher profit than the rate allowed for the regulation business, its excess earnings will be appropriated toward the unregulated group. Thus, if one customer uses the same equipment as another, the latter's share of the profits will be greater than the reduced rate ordered. Finally, the commission decides to limit the return on certain types of property owned by American Gas Co. to 6% percent of the ratebase. Since the rates are fixed according to the actual value of the products being produced, the value cannot be affected.",1945-05-07,2.0

He contends that it is not just the result of the rate orders but rather the impact of those orders on production and gathering. If the effect of the order cannot be proven unjust and reasonable, then judicial inquiry must be at an end because there may be infirmities in the method used to reach the result. The court disagrees with the federal power commission in its decision in Hope Natural Gas Company, arguing that the order does not have immediate effects on production or gathering. However, the case illustrates how the rate-making method can lead to different prices for different products from one well. For example, a regulated company sells all of its natural gas to a landowner who buys only his own share of the product. A co-owner shares half of the production with another company, while the landowner receives less than two times the value of the same leasehold. This case also illustrates some of the problems facing the gas industry as they relate to price reductions ordered by the federal government. It shows that the market will take into account the current and future conditions surrounding the supply of gas. There will be no reason why customers should pay more than what is necessary to perform this function. On the contrary, if demand is too low, the price will be unwisely high even if someone thinks it is reasonable. Finally, the question of whether the price is reasonable is asked.",1945-05-07,2.0

Mr. Justice Rutledge,
dissenting.
I doubt that Congress intended to involve the award of refunds of processing taxes in the abstruse learning of “disappearing presumptions.” In my opinion the terms “prima facie evidence” and “presumption” may be taken *176to have been used interchangeably in the statute. I think no more was intended than to authorize a finding in accordance with the margin evidence, if no other were presented; and in case opposing evidence should be offered, to allow inference either way according to the weight of the proof, taking into account the margin evidence. Hence, in this aspect of the case, I would rest on the decision of the Processing Tax Board of Review, which on the record reasonably may be considered to have been reached in this manner.
I also think the statute forbids going outside the base periods prescribed for comparative data. To hold otherwise would nullify the base period provisions of the Act, which I think are valid. The cause of action here rests on a waiver of the sovereign immunity to suit which Congress may make upon such conditions as it chooses. Nichols v. United States, 7 Wall. 122; Luckenbach S. S. Co. v. United States, 272 U. S. 533, 536; Minnesota v. United States, 305 U. S. 382, 388. Allowing in the evidence concerning other periods, though not for the purpose of computing margins, accomplishes indirectly what the base period provisions were designed to prohibit.
Accordingly, I think the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals should be reversed, with directions to affirm the decision of the Processing Tax Board of Review.

Mr. Justice Rutledge,

I would affirm the judgment. But I do not reach the interesting and important questions debated by the Court’s opinion and my dissenting brethren. They are of such a character that, in my opinion, they should not be determined in the absence of a record presenting facts and issues making this necessary. In this case the facts do not so clearly present the issues of “fencing” and “blocking” that decision upon them is required or appropriate.
Those issues were not raised or considered until the case reached the Court of Appeals. Evidence concerning intent to suppress was not received in the District Court and *385petitioner is entitled to its day in court upon that question, unless it has conceded it. The record, as this Court’s opinion indicates, is not clear that the concession has been made with the effect of admitting that petitioner had no intention to exploit the patent. If, as the trial court found, the machine without the splitting knife would not “produce any useful result,” this fact together with the assertion of the claims relating to the full combination, or with it and the concessions apparently made in the Court of Appeals, might be sufficient to sustain that court’s conclusion that the only purpose of the alleged invention was to “fence” or “block.” But the Court of Appeals expressly rejected the trial court’s finding in this respect; and a showing of motion pictures here, such as took place in the Court of Appeals, appeared to demonstrate conclusively that the machine not only works without the cutting knife, but produces a highly useful result if the pears are split before being placed in the machine for bobbing, peeling and coring. Whatever foundation might have been found, therefore, to support the conclusion of intent to fence or block, in the machine’s lack of capacity to produce any useful result, disappears from the case. .
The record, however, discloses another ground which was considered in the Patent Office and the District Court, wholly sufficient to dispose of the case and requiring affirmance of the judgment. This was that the claims in issue are too broad to cover the invention. No one of the claims specifies or indicates that the pears must be pre-split in order for the invention to be used or to produce a useful result. With commendable candor, counsel conceded this in the argument here, and indeed the claims on their face require the concession. Patents are not to be granted upon claims which do not accurately describe the invention and all- of its essential features. These claims are stated in language broad enough to include whole *386pears. Admittedly the machine will not work, without the knife, as to them. In my judgment therefore the claims are too broad. The Patent Office and the District Court so found. The question is open and was presented in the Court of Appeals and here. Accordingly I would affirm the judgment.

I think it is important to keep in mind a basic difference between the problem of marital capacity and the problem of support.
*282We held in Williams v. North Carolina, 317 U. S. 287, that a Nevada divorce decree granted to a spouse domiciled there was entitled to full faith and credit in North Carolina. That case involved the question of marital capacity. The spouse who obtained the Nevada decree was being prosecuted in North Carolina for living with the one woman whom Nevada recognized as his lawful wife. Quite different considerations would have been presented if North Carolina had merely sought to compel the husband to support his deserted wife and children, whether the Nevada decree had made no provision for the support of the former wife and children or had provided an amount deemed insufficient by North Carolina. In other words, it is not apparent that the spouse who obtained the decree can defeat an action for maintenance or support in another State by showing that he was domiciled in the State which awarded him the divorce decree. It is one thing if the spouse from whom the decree of divorce is obtained appears or is personally served. See Yarborough v. Yarborough, 290 U. S. 202; Davis v. Davis, 305 U. S. 32. But I am not convinced that in absence of an appearance or personal service the decree need be given full faith and credit when it comes to maintenance or support of the other, spouse or the children. See Pennoyer v. Neff, 95 U. S. 714. The problem under the full faith and credit clause is to accommodate as fully as possible the conflicting interests of the two States. See Magnolia Petroleum Co. v. Hunt, 320 U. S. 430, 447 (dissenting opinion). The question of marital capacity will often raise an irreconcilable conflict between the policies of the two States. See Williams v. North Carolina, supra. One must give way in the larger interest of the federal union. But the same conflict is not necessarily present when it comes to maintenance or support. The State where the deserted wife is domiciled has a deep concern in the welfare of the family deserted by the head of the household. If he is required to support his former wife, he is not made a bigamist and *283the offspring of his second marriage are not bastardized. In that view Pennsylvania in this case might refuse to alter its former order of support or might enlarge it, even though Nevada in which the other spouse was domiciled and obtained his divorce made a different provision for support or none at all. See Radin, The Authenticated Full Faith and Credit Clause, 39 Ill. L. Rev. 1, 28.

Mr. Chief Justice Stone,
dissenting.
No doubt there are philosophers who would argue, what is implicit in the decision now rendered, that in a complex modern society there is such interdependence of its members that the activities of most of them are necessary to the activities of most others. But I think that Congress did not make that philosophy the basis of the coverage of the Fair Labor Standards Act. It did not, by a “house-that-Jack-built” chain of causation, bring within the sweep of the statute the ultimate causa causarum which result in the production of goods for commerce. Instead it defined production as a physical process. It said in § 3 (j) “ ‘Produced’ means produced, manufactured, mined, handled, or in any other manner worked on” and declared that those who participate in any of these processes “or in any process or occupation necessary to” them are engaged in production and subject to the Act.
In Kirschbaum Co. v. Walling, 316 U. S. 517, after pointing out that Congress did not undertake to make the Act applicable to all occupations which affect commerce, we held that the services of elevator men and other service employees in a manufacturing loft building, where those services contributed to and assisted the manufacturing process carried on there, were within the Act. But nothing then decided or said seems to me to justify our saying that the elevator men and other maintenance employees in an office building, in which no manufacturing is done, either participate in or are necessary to the manufacturing process, because tenants of its building are ex*686ecutive or administrative officers of a company which does manufacturing elsewhere.
The fact that it is convenient or even necessary for the president of the company to ride in an elevator does not seem to me to meet the requirement of the statute that the occupation must be one necessary to the physical process of production. The statute includes those who are necessary to that process, but it does not also include those who are necessary to them. The manufacturing process could proceed without many activities which are necessary or convenient to the executive officers of a manufacturing company but which do not in any direct or immediate manner contribute to the manufacturing process, as did the services rendered in Kirschbaum Co. v. Walling, supra.
The services rendered in this case would seem to be no more related, and no more necessary to the processes of production than the services of the cook who prepares the meals of the president of the company or the chauffeur who drives him to his office. Compare McLeod v. Threlkeld, 319 U. S. 491. All are too remote from the physical process of production to be said to be, in any practical sense, a part of or necessary to it.
I would reverse the judgment.

This case concerns two grounds: 1) that both Harry and the other member of the C.I. were involved in some form of political activity; and 2) that they had to be co-operating with the government in order to bring about the overthread of the government through force or violence rather than just giving financial assistance.

Mr. Justice Douglas,

concurs.
We cannot agree that the injury to appellant is so remote and speculative as to preclude it from attacking on constitutional grounds the award in question. The award, whether small or great, enters into the employer’s cost experience; and the future premium payable by the employer reflects in part any increase or decrease in his cost experience. If the employer is not paying the maximum rate, an increase in his cost experience will inevitably make *309him pay a rate which would be lower but for the increase in his cost experience. And if, perchance, he is already paying the maximum rate, an increase in his cost experience will inevitably hold him there longer or lessen any reduction to which he otherwise would be entitled. The precise effect on future rates cannot, of course, be presently ascertained. Nor could it be shown in any case, whether the award was $460 or $46,000. For the rates are fixed annually and at the time of any one award all of the elements entering into the future computation will not be known. So if this employer is barred here because he can show no injury, he and all other employers will be barred in every case.1 Yet we know from the operation of the system that the cost experience of each employer determines 60 per cent of his future rate. Their respective costs also affect to a lesser degree the basic premium rate applicable to each employer’s class, and 40 per cent of that basic rate is reflected in the actual premium rate paid by each employer in that class. We might as well say that no employer could ever challenge the constitutionality of an award under this system because bankruptcy, fire or some cataclysm might put him out of business before a new rate is fixed.
On the merits we think Campbell v. Holt, 115 U. S. 620, and Chase Securities Corp. v. Donaldson, 325 U. S. 304, govern this case. At no time was the employee’s claim for aggravation extinguished. At all times the Department could have reopened the claim and made an additional award. We therefore do not reach the question of *310the constitutionality of an act which makes it possible to enlarge an award where previously there had been a final adjudication of the claim. Cf. Danzer & Co. v. Gulf & Ship Island R. Co., 268 U. S. 633.
We would affirm the judgment.

We are not advised that the employer can contest the validity of a prior award at the time the Department of Labor and Industries is fixing the premium rate to be paid into the fund for the ensuing year. The pertinent statute (Rem. Rev. Stat. § 7676) does not prescribe such a remedy and the decision of the Washington Supreme Court in Mud Bay Logging Co. v.

This arrangement allowed him to determine how much time he will spend in each city during the tax year. The Railroad Company provided an office at Jackson but did not provide any office space when he worked there. The amount of time spent in Jackson was determined by the amount of money he traveled.

Therefore, the workers must be treated as necessary to the operation of the factory. If they do not perform this work, their customers will have to employ similar employees of other companies. In addition, the fact that these employees are so closely tied to the business makes them subject to the provisions of section 13-a)(2).

The Chief Justice and I think that.the judgment of conviction in these cases should be affirmed for reasons stated in Part I of Mr. Justice Frankfurter’s opinion.
We think that under § 10 (a) (2) of the Selective Service Act, rightly construed, the registrant is required, on pain of criminal penalties, to obey the local board’s order to report for induction into the armed forces, even though the board’s order or the action of the appeal board on *146which it is based, is erroneous. “In order to obtain a judicial determination of such issues such registrants must first submit to induction and raise the issue by habeas corpus.” H. Rep. No. 36, 79th Cong., 1st Sess. (1945) 5. It follows that if the registrant is indicted for disobedience of the board’s order he cannot defend on the ground that the draft procedure has not been complied with or, if convicted, secure his release on that ground by resort to habeas corpus. The result is that such relief is open to him only if he obeys the order and submits to induction, when he is free to seek habeas corpus.
We do not find in the record of either case sufficient basis 'for reversal thereof on the grounds suggested in Part II of Me. Justice Frankfurter’s opinion.

3812,9419752,104235,030concurrence,"
Mr. Justice Frankfurter,
concurring.
The case lies within very narrow confines. The publication under scrutiny is a periodical. It is therefore entitled to the special rates accorded by Congress provided it is published “for the dissemination of information of a public character, or devoted to literature, the sciences, arts . . .” If it be devoted to “literature” it becomes unnecessary to consider how small an infusion of “information of a public character” entitles a periodical to the second-class mail rates when the bulk of its contents would not otherwise satisfy the Congressional conditions.
Congress has neither defined its conception of “literature” nor has it authorized the Postmaster General to do so. But it has placed a limitation upon what is to be deemed “literature” for a privilege which the Court rightly calls a form of subsidy. Matters that are declared nonmailable (Criminal Code § 211; 35 Stat. 1129,36 Stat. 1339; 18 U. S. C. § 334) are of course not “literature” within the scope of the second-class privilege. But the Postmaster General does not contend that the periodical with which we are concerned was nonmailable. He merely contends that it was not devoted to the kind of “literature” or “art” which may claim the subsidy of second-class matter. But since Congress has seen fit to allow “literature” conveyed by periodicals to have the second-class privilege without making any allowable classification of “literature,” except only that nonmailable matter as defined by § 211 of the Criminal Code is excluded, the *160area of “literature, the sciences, arts” includes all composition of words, pictorial representation,' or notations that are intelligible to any portion of the population, no matter whether their appeal is extensive or esoteric. Since the Postmaster General disavows the nonmailability of the issues of the periodical he had before him and since Congress did not qualify “literature, the sciences, arts” by any standards of taste or edification or public elevation, the Postmaster General exceeded his powers in denying this periodical a second-class permit.
It seems to me important strictly to confine discussion in this case because its radiations touch, on the one hand, the very basis of a free society, that of the right of expression beyond the conventions of the day,, and, on the other hand, the freedom of society from constitutional compulsion to subsidize enterprise, whether in the world of matter or of mind. While one may entirely agree with Mr. Justice Holmes, in Leach v. Carlile, 258 U. S. 138, 140, as to the extent to which the First Amendment forbids control of the post so far as sealed letters are concerned, one confronts an entirely different set of questions in considering the basis on which the Government may. grant or withheld subsidies through low postal rates, and huge subsidies, if one is to judge by the glimpse afforded by the present case. It will be time enough to consider such questions when the Court cannot escape decision upon them.

Me. Justice Muephy,
dissenting.
I agree that to print approximately 10,000 newspapers a day and regularly to send 45 of them, or % of 1%, out of the State is to produce goods for interstate commerce. But I cannot agree that Congress meant to include a business of that nature within the ambit of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938.
This Court, in Labor Board v. Fainblatt, 306 U. S. 601, 606, stated that “The amount of the commerce regulated is of special significance only to the extent that Congress may be taken to have excluded commerce of small volume from the operation of its regulatory measure by express provision or fair implication.” Concededly, Congress has not excluded commerce of small volume from the coverage of the Fair Labor Standards Act by “express provision.” But certainly the “fair implication” is one. of exclusion. On numerous occasions we have pointed out that Congress in this Act did not exercise the full scope of its commerce power, Kirschbaum Co. v. Walling, 316 U. S. 517, 522-523, and that Congress plainly indicated its purpose to leave local business to the protection of the States so far as wage and hour problems were concerned, Walling v. Jacksonville Paper Co., 317 U. S. 564, 570; Phillips Co. v. Walling, 324 U. S. 490, 497.
*186In my opinion, a company that produces 99of its products for local commerce is essentially and realistically a local business. True, % of 1% of its production is for interstate commerce, thus subjecting it to the constitutional power of Congress when and if exercised. But that fact does not make it any less a local business, which we have said Congress plainly excluded from this Act.
I would therefore affirm the judgment below in this respect.

Mr. Justice Murphy,

It is not without difficulty that I dissent from a procedure the constitutionality of which has been established for many years. But I am unable to approve the use of non-judicial subpoenas issued by administrative agents.
Administrative law has increased greatly in the past few years and seems destined to be augmented even further in the future. But attending this growth should be a new and broader sense of responsibility on the part of administrative agencies and officials. Excessive use or abuse of authority can not only destroy man’s instinct for liberty but will eventually undo the administrative processes themselves. Our history is not without a precedent of a successful revolt against a .ruler who “sent hither swarms of officers to harass our people.”
Perhaps we are too far removed from the experiences ' of the past to appreciate fully the consequences that may result from an irresponsible though well-meaning use of *219the subpoena power. To allow a non-judicial officer, unarmed with judicial process, to demand the books and papers of an individual is an open invitation to abuse of that power. It is no answer that the individual may-refuse to produce the material demanded. Many persons have yielded solely because of the air of authority with which the demand is made, a demand that cannot be enforced without subsequent judicial aid. Many invasions of private rights thus occur without the restráining hand of the judiciary ever intervening.
Only by confining the subpoena power exclusively to the judiciary can there be any insurance against this corrosion of liberty. Statutory enforcement would not thereby be made impossible. Indeed, it would be made easier. A people’s desire to cooperate with the enforcement of a statute is in direct proportion to the respect for individual rights shown in the enforcement process. Liberty is too priceless to be forfeited through the zeal of ah administrative agent.

The court hears petitioner's defenses and decides that due process must be granted to resolve the issue of whether or not a judgment can be set aside for certain reasons. In this case, it is decided that there will be no need for notice because the 1938 judgment does not require it.

The court assumes that petitioner's right to defend against the judgment was exteruished by the docking of the judgment; however, the court believes that there are two assumptions: first, that the original decree did not change the circumstances under which the debt was accrued; and second, that his right to make defenses before the date of the payment of the monthly installments were extinguished. Although the court considers these two assumptions, it is difficult to determine whether they will bring the case into the rule. It is impossible to see how New York law could force a wife to give more notice when she cannot afford to pay the monthly payments. Finally, even though the court has allowed the husband to raise new defenses at the time of the entry of an order for execution, the fact that the marriage contract allows him to do so means that the wife must be given additional notice as to what changes have occurred during the divorce proceeding. Furthermore, since the courts only allow the spouse to show up at the appointed time, the wife can avoid having to explain why her husband failed to pay any of the bills. If the wife shows up late, then the husband may try to appeal the judgment without further notice. This would be fraud.

I join in the opinion of the Court for I do not read it as does my brother Reed. The Bill of Rights provides that private property shall not “be taken for public use, without just compensation.” U. S. Const., Amend. V. This Court has never deviated from the view that under the Constitution a claim that a taking is not “for public use” is open for judicial consideration, ultimately by this Court. It is equally true that in the numerous cases in which the issue was adjudicated, this Court never found that the legislative determination that the use was “public” exceeded Constitutional bounds. But the fact that the nature of the subject matter gives the legislative determination nearly immunity from judicial review does not mean that the power to review is wanting. All the cases cited in the Court’s opinion sustaining a taking recognize and accept the power of judicial review. I assume that in citing these cases the Court again recognizes *558the doctrine that whether a taking is for a public purpose is not a question beyond judicial competence.

He argues that the state has exclusive legislative power over the property, which is held by the petitioner as security for its payment of taxes. The case concerns the sale of an unpaid portion of the land on which the owner had agreed to pay the full price of the purchase. The court disagrees with the Supreme Court and grants the petitioners' claim that the property is exempt from federal taxation because it is owned by the U.S. under Article I, Section 8, Clause 17 of the Constitution. In other words, the government can only tax property subject to its will. If the property were sold to a private buyer, then the US would not be able to tax it. However, this case does not involve the question of whether the American government should sell the property to another party. Instead, it deals with the implied constitutionality of the transfer of property between the two governments. For example, we have seen cases where states sought to tax land that was not held legally for the purpose or under authority of the ""Cession Clause,"" but could not be determined how much value the land might actually be worth. This case also addresses the issue of whether state taxation must be levied until the certificate of title is issued.

I agree with the result and with the Court’s view that the evidence was amply sufficient to sustain the Tax Court’s findings and conclusions in this case and in Lusthaus v. Commissioner, post, p. 293. Candor forces me to add, however, that in my judgment the decisions’ effect is to rule that in situations of this character the formation of a limited partnership under state law between husband and wife, with the latter as the limited partner, following immediately upon the husband’s donation to the wife of a share in the assets of the business previously and after-wards conducted by him and conditioned upon her leaving the assets in the business, as a matter of federal tax law does not accomplish the formation of a partnership sufficient to relieve the husband of tax liability for the income derived after the transfer from use in the business of the share thus donated to the wife. In other words, I think that as a matter of law the taxpayers in these cases were *293liable for the taxes assessed against them, including the deficiency assessments; and, therefore, in my opinion the Tax Court is not free in these or substantially similar circumstances to draw either the contrary conclusion or opposing ones. While it is not strictly necessary to express this opinion in these cases in view of the Tax Court’s consistent conclusions of liability, it is inconceivable to me that the two cases, consistently with the federal tax law, could be decided the other way or with different outcomes on the facts presented. Being of this opinion, I consider the failure to state it could only tend to perpetuate a source of possible confusion for the future.

The decisions of this Court leave no doubt that a man’s time may, as a matter of law, be in the service of another *371though he be inactive. E. g., Armour & Co. v. Wantock, 323 U. S. 126. This is, practically speaking, the ordinary situation of employment in a “stand-by” capacity. United States v. Local 807, 315 U. S. 521, 535. The basis of a back-pay order under the National Labor Relations Act, 49 Stat. 449, 29 U. S. C. § 151, is precisely that. When the employer is liable for back pay, he is so liable because under the circumstances, though he has illegally discharged the employee, he still absorbs his time. Phelps Dodge Corp. v. Labor Board, 313 U. S. 177. In short, an employer must pay wages although, in violation of law, he has subjected his employee to enforced idleness. Since such compensation is in fact paid as wages, it is a plain disregard of the law for the.Social Security Board not to include such payments among the employees’ wages. Neither the terms of the Social Security Act, 49 Stat. 620, 53 Stat. 1360, 42 U. S. C. § 301, nor the implications of policy, comparable to some aspects of the Railway Labor Act, 44 Stat. 577, 48 Stat. 926, 48 Stat. 1185, 49 Stat. 1921, 54 Stat. 785, 45 U. S.

I agree that these employees would be covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act but for the exemption contained in § 13 (b) (1). That subsection exempts from § 7 of the Act “any employee with respect to whom the Interstate Commerce Commission has power to establish qualifications and maximum hours of service pursuant to the provisions of section 204 of the Motor Carrier Act, 1935 . . .”
There is no doubt that the Interstate Commerce Commission has the power to establish qualifications and maximum hours for employees of a carrier who are mechanics engaged in greasing, repairing, servicing, and maintaining its transportation equipment. In the Matter of Maximum Hours of Service of Motor Carrier Employees, 28 M. C. C. 125. I think that power would still exist if the carrier separately incorporated its garage. This affiliated garage is not like an independent commercial garage. It is still a part of the carrier’s business — no more separate or distinct than any other department. The same people own it, operate it, and manage it. If the Interstate Commerce Commission, acting under § 204 of the Motor Carrier Act of 1935, had undertaken to establish the quali*473fications and maximum hours for these mechanics, I cannot believe that we would allow its jurisdiction to be defeated by that device, whatever may have been the reason for the separate incorporation of the garage. For these mechanics were, in the practical sense, employees of the carrier after, as well as before, incorporation. And the exemption contained in § 13 (b) (1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act is dependent, not on the exercise by the Interstate Commerce Commission of its power, but on. the existence of that power.1 The power which Congress granted the Interstate Commerce Commission to establish qualifications and maximum hours for mechanics should not be allowed to be defeated by arrangements between parties which, for certain purposes, may estop them from asserting that two corporations in form are one in substance.
This particular exemption may not be a wise one. But we must take the law as it is written. The policy behind the exemption is defeated, if mere legal forms are allowed to nullify the power of the Interstate Commerce Commission to deal with the problem of safety. As the Commission said, . . the carefully supervised work of skilled mechanics is a most important factor in the prevention of accidents, and therefore in the promotion of highway safety.” In the Matter of Maximum Hours of Service of Motor Carrier Employees, supra, p. 133.

Our opinion should be confined to the single question which the petitioner presents for our decision, whether the retention by the United States of the legal title to the taxed land precludes its taxation to petitioner, which, under its contract with the Government, has acquired possession and right to possession. As I have no doubt on this question, I agree the judgments should be affirmed.

The Government sold a piece of surplus property located in St. Paul, Minnesota. It put the vendee in possession .but retained the legal title, with the right of re-entry, as security for portions of the purchase price remaining due under the contract of sale. The decisive question before us is whether the interest thus retained by the United States bars Minnesota, under a general non-discriminatory law, from taxing the vendee’s interest in the property. The Constitution itself furnishes no answer in terms. But the considerations governing the appropriate adjustment between national and state powers of taxation, where the incidence of taxation may affect the property or functions of one another, do not require that entire immunity from state taxation be afforded this piece of property because *572of the interest which the United States retained to secure the unpaid purchase price. Since the Government’s security is left untouched by Minnesota, what remains of the Government’s relation to the property is too attenuated to withdraw it entirely from Minnesota’s taxing power.
The matter would hardly be open to question but for a series of cases arising under land grant legislation. As the opinion of the Court persuasively shows, these decisions rest upon considerations of policy not relevant to the immediate situation.
I agree with the Chief Justice that our disposition of this case should be confined to the only question raised by the record, that of the State’s power to tax, unembarrassed by any issue as to territorial jurisdiction. The Chief Justice gives conclusive ground for such abstention. Moreover, even as to property indisputably owned by the Government, there may be “uncertainty and confusion” whether jurisdiction belongs to the Federal Government or to a State. See Bowen v. Johnston, 306 U. S. 19, 27; and Pacific Coast Dairy v. Dept., 318 U. S. 285, 299. Taxability and territorial jurisdiction are not correlative. We ought not to borrow trouble.

If a retailer sold meat or any other commodity to a consumer only on condition that he purchase and pay for a wholly worthless article, it would be clear that price ceilings had been violated. For the attribution of value to the worthless article would be nothing more than an evasive method of increasing the ceiling price on the other commodity. I can see no difference where the additional commodity, although it has value, has no value to the purchaser.
But this case is different in both respects or so the jury might find. First, chicken gizzards, chicken skin, or chicken feet are not wholly worthless articles. There is demand for them and they have a value. Second, they were tied-in with sales to retailers who constitute the market for chicken gizzards, chicken skin, and chicken feet. If in fact they had no value on that market, evasion of price ceilings would be established. But since they apparently had some value on the retail market, no violation of price ceilings occurred unless the price charged for them in fact exceeded that market value. That might *628be shown either by proof of the fact that the market value was lower or by showing that the quantity forced on the retailers was in excess of the quantity which the market could absorb.
The case should be remanded for a new trial on that basis. For the trial court ruled that the additional articles sold were valueless and that the “one question in the case is whether the sale of the chicken skin and feet was a necessary condition to the purchase of the other.” That ruling took from the jury the basic issue in the case.
I think there was evidence that these chicken gizzards, chicken skin, and chicken feet were valueless to some of the retailers and that a conviction would be warranted. But it is not enough that we conclude on the whole record that a defendant is guilty. Bollenbach v. United States, 326 U. S. 607.

The jury commissioner confirms this claim: ""All the iron crafts, brickmakers, carpenter, and milliardists.""

Mr. Justice .Rutledge,

I am in agreement with the result and substantially so with Mr. Justice Murphy’s opinion. I do not think that administrative regulations, given by statute the function of defining the substance of criminal conduct, should have broader or more inclusive construction than statutes performing the same function. If the regulations involved here had been enacted specifically by Congress in statutory form, I do not think they could properly be construed to forbid tie-in sales of these commodities per se.
As the opinion points out, the regulations, with reference to other commodities, expressly prohibited tie-in sales, regardless of whether the tied-in commodity had value. Persons dealing in those commodities were specifically informed by the regulations, therefore, that such sales would be in violation of the Act. There was no such specific prohibition applicable at the time of the sales in question to sales of poultry. However the general pro*629hibition against evasion contained in § 1429.5 of Revised Maximum Price Regulation No. 269 might be interpreted, if there had been no regulations specifically forbidding tie-in sales of other commodities, in view of their existence and the absence of any similar provision relating to poultry, I do not think it permissible to construe § 1429.5 as covering the same ground. Persons reading the regulations to determine what conduct had been forbidden were entitled in my opinion to conclude that the Administrator, whenever he thought tie-in sales were per se evasive or. in violation of the Act’s policy, had expressly so stated and conversely that where he had not expressly forbidden the practice, it was not to be understood as prohibited by general language applicable to many other types of situation but not specifically to this one. This view, I think, would be required if the regulations had been enacted in statutory form. As regulations they cannot be given broader content.
Accordingly I agree with the conclusion that tie-in sales were not forbidden at the time of these sales, as to poultry. I also agree that the trial court, both in its instructions and in some of its rulings upon the admissibility of evidence, went on a conception of the law inconsistent with this view. I therefore concur in the Court’s disposition of the cause.

“Investment contract” is not a term of art; it is a conception dependent upon the circumstances of a particular situation. If this case came before us on a finding authorized by Congress that the facts disclosed an “investment contract” within the general scope of § 2 (1) of the Securities Act, 48 Stat. 74,15 U. S. C. § 77b (1), the Securities and.Exchange Commission’s finding would govern, unless, on the record, it was wholly unsupported. But *302that is not the case before us. Here the ascertainment of the existence of an “investment contract” had to be made independently by the District Court and it found against its existence. 60 F. Supp. 440. The Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit sustained that finding. 151 F. 2d 714. If respect is to be paid to the wise rule of judicial administration under which this Court does not upset concurrent findings of two lower courts in the ascertainment of facts and the relevant inferences to be drawn from them, this case clearly calls for its application. See Allen v. Trust Company of Georgia, 326 U. S. 630. For the crucial issue in this case turns on whether the contracts for the land and the contracts for the management of the property were in reality separate agreements or merely parts of a single transaction. It is clear from its opinion that the District Court was warranted in its conclusion that the record does not establish the existence of an investment contract:
“. . . the record in this case shows that not a single sale of citrus grove property was made by the Howey Company during the period involved in this suit, except to purchasers who actually inspected the property before purchasing the same.

Simply because other arrangements may have the appearances of this transaction but are employed as an evasion of the Securities Act does not mean that the present contracts were evasive.

A revolting crime, such as was committed here, requires unusual circumspection for its trial, so that dispassionate judgment may have sway over the inevitable tendency of the facts to introduce prejudice or passion into the judgment. This means that the accused must not be denied any substantial safeguard for control of those influences. A trial for a capital offense which falls short of that standard, although unwittingly, does not give him his due.
Congress introduced the requirements of premeditation and deliberation into the District of Columbia Code, Title 22, §§2401, 2404, in 1901. 31 Stat. 1321, with which compare Rev. Stat. § 5339. I do not think it intended by doing so to change the preexisting law only in cases of intoxication. Hence, I cannot assent to the view that the instructions given to the jury were adequate on this phase of the case. I think the defendant was entitled to the requested instruction which was refused or one of similar import.
I have no doubt that the trial court declined to give it believing that it was not required, perhaps also that it would be erroneous. For the fair-minded and able assistant district attorney who argued the case here conceded, with characteristic candor, that the courts of the District have consistently limited the effect of the controlling Code provision, by way of changing the preexisting law, to cases of intoxication. But, for the reasons in the opinion of Mr. Justice Murphy, I do not think Congress intended the change to be restricted so narrowly. Accordingly I join in that opinion.
*495Apart from this defect, the instructions given were correct as far as they went. They were however in wholly abstract form, which in some cases might be sufficient. But the issues of premeditation and deliberation were crucial here on the question of life or death. A more adequate charge, I agree with Mr. Justice Frankfurter, would have pointed up the evidence, at least in broad outline, in relation to those issues.
Because I think the charge was deficient in not including the requested instruction or one substantially similar, thus in my opinion failing to meet the standard set by Congress in the Code, and because the effect of this deficiency was magnified by the failure to point up the instructions given in some more definite relation to the evidence, I think the judgment should be reversed.

The jury found this defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt after the trial judge had charged that: “A defendant is not required to establish his innocence but the Government must establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. If the facts and circumstances surrounding the case are as consistent with innocence as with guilt, he is not guilty.” Six other times the judge explicitly charged the jury to the same effect: The defendant’s innocence is presumed; she need not prove it; the burden is on the Government to prove her guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Yet the Court now reverses on the ground that the jury might conceivably have taken three sentences in the trial judge’s charge to mean that the defendant must prove innocence, which conceivably might have led the jury to believe that the court might have intended to withdraw his seven explicit instructions to the contrary. The three sentences were: “Did she steal them? Who did if she didn’t? You are to decide that.” Instructions such as these as to who stole the coupons were necessary because of the petitioner’s defense that somebody else had taken them. The trial judge was obviously telling the jury not to ignore the petitioner’s defense. No reference was made to burden of proof and no ordinary juror, unskilled in legal dialectics, would have suspected the latent ambiguity which the Court has discovered. Of course, hypercritical *640scrutiny of each word and sentence in every charge when considered alone would always reveal dual meanings. The sentences here in question, like the sentences in every charge, should be given a common sense interpretation in their relationship to all instructions and the issues raised. When so considered, it is impossible for me to believe that the jury was confused as to burden of proof. Seven correct explicit instructions should not be considered neutralized by legalistic inferences established by purely formal analysis.

3921,9419862,104316,020lead,"In this case, the court acquits Walter Pinkerton and Daniel of conspiracy to violate the Internal Revenue code. They were both charged with violations of the tax law. Walter was accused of nine substantive offenses and two conspiracy counts. The jury finds Walter guilty on 9 of the substantive charges and on the conspiracy count. It finds Daniel guilty on 6 of the primary offenses but sentenced him to 30 months in prison. On the second conspiracy count, he was found guilty of $1,000 and sentenceed generally to imprisonment for 30 months. The judgment of conviction was affirmed by Justice Douglas. This case concerns a conflict among the decisions of Sall and United States Court of Appeal. Both courts have held that each conspiracy charge is a separate offense under the criminal code. However, they have recognized that there are cases where a single crime may not be connected to another. For example, when a person commits an illegal act, it is distinct from the execution of the crime itself. A conspiracy involves deliberate planning to subvert laws, educate and prepare the conspiratorsfor further and habitually criminal practices. Thus, even though one person does the actual act, his accomplices do not commit the same crime as the other. Therefore, no evidence exists to support the claim that all three petitioners were involved in the conspiracy; however, we believe that there was sufficient evidence to establish that their involvement was part of the scheme.",1946-10-14,1.0
3922,9419863,104316,040dissent,"In this case, the Court argues that it is dangerous precedent to convict Daniel for conspiracy because there was no evidence of his involvement in the conspiracy. The only evidence against Walter was that he abetted and encouraged him to commit the offenses charged. The court also ruled that both men were guilty of conspiring. This ruling violates Congress's definition of ""finished substantive offenses,"" which means that one can either be convicted for another's crime or punished for the man who committed the same offense twice. It does not matter whether they are criminals or not. Both types of offenses are different. For example, when a conspiracy has ripped into complete crime, it becomes easier to disregard their differing differences and treat one as exactly the same as the other. Thus, even if someone is convicted of two crimes on the same basis, double punishment may be possible.",1946-10-14,1.0

I am satisfied beyond all reasonable doubt, from the testimony and admissions of the petitioner himself, made in open court, that he had never at any time, either before or after his naturalization, deviated from his wholehearted allegiance to, and constant service of, the German Nazi Government.
I realize, as the dissent in this case emphasizes, the dangers inherent in denaturalizations. Had this judgment rested on the petitioner’s mere philosophical or political beliefs, expressed or unexpressed, I should not concur in its affirmance. But petitioner’s admissions as to his own conduct leave me in no doubt at all that he was, even in obtaining naturalization, serving the German Government with the same fanatical zeal which motivated *675the saboteurs sent to the United States to wage war. I am unable to say that Congress is without constitutional power to authorize courts, after fair trials like this one, to cancel citizenship obtained by the methods and for the purposes shown by this record.

3925,9419866,104317,040dissent,"The dissenter rejects the claim that Paul Kempauer's naturalization should be annulled because of his anti-federalist views. He asserts that Knauer did not take the oh-so-subtle allegiance to Adolph and Nazi Germany, but rather was an active advocate for these two groups. In this case, however, it is impossible for him to be stripped of his naturalized status by any means. For example, if he were arrested or sentenced to deportation, he would have to forfeit his citizenship in order to be allowed to return to the United States. If Congress tried to deny him his right to become a citizen, then he could no longer be considered a naturalist. However, unless Congress had given up on such measures as naturalization, there would still be class distinctions between native-born Americans and foreign born citizens. Thus, even if Congress gave up on naturalizing people, they would still remain inferior to native-Americans. This is why Congress cannot simply give them their rights without actually giving them those rights. It is only when Congress has given up its power to grant naturalization that it can create classes of citizens who are superior to native American citizens. Therefore, Congress must make sure that ""the act of admission"" is taken as final before it can be applied to anyone else. Otherwise, one class of citizens will be free and secure while the other class will be conditional and insecure. Finally, Congress may want to remove some of these conditions so that the national-born citizen does not have to go through with the process of naturalization again. That way, instead of having to deal with the threat of being forced to relinquish his freedom, the federal government can try to get rid of both classes at the same time.",1946-10-14,1.0

I concur in the Court’s opinion and judgment. In doing so, however, I express no judgment concerning other questions determined on the appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals, 147 F. 2d 93, and presented in the application for certiorari or the later petition for rehearing and enlargement of the scope of review here, including the question whether upon the particular facts the law has been applied in such a manner as to bring about, in substantial effect, multiple punishment for the same offense. Cf. Pinkerton v. United States, ante, pp. 640, 648, dissenting opinion.
*816That question has been discussed in the briefs and the argument, for its bearing upon the disposition of the single question which certiorari was granted to review, namely, “whether actual exclusion of competitors is necessary to the crime of monopolization under § 2 of the Sherman Act.” 324 U. S. 836. On this issue I have no doubt of the correctness of the Court's conclusion that the offense of monopolization is complete when power is acquired to exclude competitors and therefore that actual exclusion need not be shown, for the reasons set forth in the opinion. Whether, in this view, multiple punishment may arise upon application of the law to particular facts under counts charging conspiracy in restraint of trade, monopolization, and conspiracy to monopolize presents a different question which can be determined only by examination of the manner in which the particular application has been made. Since, in view of the limited character of our action in granting certiorari, neither the issue of multiple punishment nor the facts of record upon which it arises are before us for review, it would be inappropriate to express opinion on that question.

Before Congress passed the special Act under which this suit was brought, I think that the Government was under no more legal or equitable obligation to pay these respondents than it was under obligation to pay whatever descendants are left of the numerous other tribes whose lands and homes have been taken from them since the Nation was founded. See Northwestern Shoshone Indians v. United States, 324 U. S. 335, 354-358, concurring opinion. It seems pretty clear to me, however, that Congress in the Act of August 26,1935, 49 Stat. 801, created an obligation on the part of the Government to pay these Indians for all lands to which their ancestors held an “original Indian title.” This interpretation of the Act is not only consistent *55with the unusually broad language Congress used, but also fits into the pattern of congressional legislation which has become progressively more generous in its treatment of Indians. The capstone of this type of legislation was an Act passed by the last Congress, which established an Indian Claims Commission with sweeping powers to pay old Indian claims growing out of seizure of their lands, among other things. This Commission is given power to make awards, subject to review by the Court of Claims, with and without regard to previous rules of law or equity courts. The Commission is even given a blanket power to make awards upon finding, for example, that the land of Indians was taken by the Government in a way that did not comport with “fair and honorable dealings.” 60 Stat. 1049,1050, § 2 (5). Since whatever our action here, these Indians could, I assume, pursue their claims under this broad recent legislation, and since the language of the Act before us does not preclude a similarly broad interpretation, I see no reason why it should be otherwise interpreted. This leads me to concur in affirmance of the judgment.-

The justness of the claim for interest in these cases is underlined by the fact that the land was taken over four years before full payment was made. The United States renounced these contracts and retained possession of the properties by the Declaration of Taking Act, which by its terms, 46 Stat. 1421, 40 U. S.

In these condemnation actions the agreed price, stated in the contracts, became the “just compensation” of the Declaration of Taking Act and by that Act interest was due for such amount as had not been deposited with the trial court when the declaration was filed. Interest for the period between the declaration and the payment of the value into the trial court should be allowed on the amount by which the sum fixed in the final decree exceeded the sum deposited with the declaration of taking.

  In conformity with Michigan procedure, petitioner moved for leave to file a delayed motion for new trial in the court in which he had been convicted of first-degree murder. Serious impairment of his constitutional rights at the arraignment and trial were asserted as grounds for the motion. The trial court denied the motion, and the Supreme Court of Michigan on appeal affirmed that ruling. 313 Mich. 548, 21 N. W. 2d 849.

On the same day, petitioner was arraigned, tried, convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. The record indicates that petitioner was without legal assistance throughout all these proceedings and was never advised of his right to counsel. The court did not explain the consequences of the plea of guilty, and the record indicates considerable confusion in petitioner’s mind at the time of the arraignment as to the effect of such a plea.

However, the court disagrees with the legislature's decision to use tax raised funds to pay bus fares to public schools. The first argument is that the government cannot tax someone to help others carrying out their private business; the second argument is an argument against the constitution's prohibition against ""the establishment of religion.""

Madison asserts that the Constitution does not prohibit religion from being established or maintained by the government; rather, it allows the government to create separation between religion and state. Madison contends that ""religioon"" is only one of two prohibitions in the Constitution: first, there are two meanings within the Constitution regarding religion; and second, there can also be multiple definitions of religion. Madison believes that the word ""an establishment"" refers only to an official relationship with the state. The Articles of Confederation were signed into law in 1778 as Madison's bill for establishing religious freedom. Madison was a co-author of the Virginia Bill for Establishment Religious Freedom, which passed through the House of Representatives in 1779. Madison supported the bill until Henry became governor in November 1784. Madison then proposed a new taxing bill called the Assessment Bill on December 21, 1785. Madison opposed this bill because it did not involve any public funds. Madison believed that the government had no right to interfere with religion since religion was private. Madison furthermore advocated for a constitutional guarantee of religious freedom under the First amendment. Madison claimed that all forms of religion could be separated from civil authority except those that involved taxes. Madison continued to oppose such measures as the assessment bill but eventually succeeded in defeating it. Madison later wrote a similar bill known as the Bill for Enforcing Religious Freedom during the Civil War.

The terms of the Act of August 24, 1937, 50 Stat. 751, 752, 28 U. S. C. § 380a, in the light of its history, have convinced me that this case should be dismissed for want of jurisdiction.
In that Act, Congress put a limit to the time within which a case may be docketed here after an appeal below is allowed. Such a limitation by Congress is in the exercise of its power to regulate the appellate jurisdiction of this Court. It is not within our power to enlarge a limit fixed by Congress unless Congress itself gave the Court such dispensing power.
In allowing a direct appeal to this Court from a district court “under such rules as may be prescribed,” Congress did not mean to give this Court power to defeat the considerations of speed in the disposition of controversies involving the constitutionality of federal legislation which led to the specific provision that a case be docketed “within sixty days from the time such appeal is allowed.” *105No rule of this Court could disregard the limitations for perfecting an appeal made by Congress. Nor does Rule 47, which was the rule responsive to the Act of August 24, 1937, purport to do so. It merely reasserts the statutory requirement that in a case like this “The record shall be made up and the case docketed in this court within sixty days from the time the appeal is allowed.” The introductory part of Rule 47, whereby the Rules of this Court regulating appellate procedure in other cases are adopted “as far as may be,” has ample scope for operation without qualifying the necessity for speedy perfection of an appeal in cases involving constitutionality, so that the validity of acts of Congress may not remain in doubt through protracted litigation. This was a deep concern of Congress and its reason for imposing the sixty-day limitation for perfecting appeals in this class of cases.
But under compulsion of the Court’s assumption of jurisdiction, I reach the merits and join in Mr. Justice Reed’s opinion.

He argues that Congress has tried to limit the freedom of public employees by prohibiting them from taking part in political debates and making them subject to certain restrictions. The Constitution guarantees that all citizens have the right to express their own views on issues important to them. However, it does not allow government employees to participate in politics because they may be corrupted by politicians who are elected by the people. This would violate the First Amendment's guarantee of free speech, assembly, protest, and petition as well as the Seventeen-Aid Clause which protects the right of voters to vote for congressmen and senators.",1947-02-10,1.0
3972,9419931,104374,040dissent,"In this paper, Douglas argues that the Court's refusal to hear Poole's constitutional claim is not justified because it does not involve an actual controversy. The court believes that these claims are ""plain enough,"" and therefore must be dismissed in order to avoid incurring any legal consequences. If they were to engage in political activities, however, they would be prevented from doing so by the Constitution; but if they were engaged in other forms of activity, such as lobbying or acting on behalf of a political organization, then they would have no right to do such things. Therefore, their actions will violate the Constitution. On a dismissal, these workers would lose their job, seniority, etc. They could sue for relief in the courts, but there would be no money judgment. However, since the declarationatory judgment procedure serves as a remedy against legislative policy, it can be used to defeat legislation. Borchard points out that declaratory relief is one of the most effective remedies available to preserve the standing quo while asserting rights. It is important to note that poole is not employed under the civil service category. He is also an industrial worker who has no relationship with the public nor with the government. There is much difference between the British system of civil service and the American system of administration. Political fortunes tend to epb and flow, top policy men come and go, new laws pass and old ones amend or repeal. And those who give continuance to administration, individuals who contribute the fundamental skill and efficiency at the daily working of government,and those on whomthe new as well As the old administration was dependent for smooth function of the complex machinery of modern Government are the core."" Thus, if Congress wants to protect the interests of all members of the union, it should not include only the higher offices but take precautions to protect even the lowest office. This means that federal employees cannot be protected from political interference. Instead, they may be forced to participate in political campaigns or work on official property. These activities are more than the exercises of official power. Justice Black suggests that law can be drawn up to punish people who use official power for political purposes.",1947-02-10,1.0

In order to avoid further action by the federal government, the state has petitioned the court to review the civil service order.

It is of course settled that this Court must consider, whenever the question is raised or even though not raised by counsel, the jurisdiction of the lower federal courts as well as the jurisdiction of this Court. Mansfield, C. & L. M. Ry. v. Swan, 111 U. S. 379, 382. But whether a State has standing to urge a claim of constitutionality under a *147Congressional grant-in-aid statute does not involve “jurisdiction” in the sense of a court’s power but only the capacity of the State to be a litigant to invoke that power. In this litigation the Government did not challenge the standing of Oklahoma to question the constitutionality of the Act until the case came here. I think it is too late to raise that question at this stage. Assuming that it is here, it is my view that under the Hatch Act, in the legislative and judicial context in which it must be read, the State can question only the correctness of the procedure and the determination of the Civil Service Commission, not the validity of the Act. Section 12 (b), (c), 54 Stat. 767, amending 53 Stat. 1147, 18 U. S. C. § 61l (b) and (c).
The Administrative Procedure Act does not apply to the present case. Act of June 11, 1946, 60 Stat. 237, § 12. That Act will, in due course, present problems for adjudication. We ought not to anticipate them when, being irrelevant, they are not before us. The Act ought not to be used even for illustrative purpose because illustrations depend on construction of the Act.

After seven years, she reports the gross rents as income and claims and is allowed deductions from taxes and operating costs. The arrearage on the mortgage increases to $15,8557. In 1938, petitioner sells the apartment building for $3,000 cash and pays $500.00 expenses out of the sale price. The tax court disagrees with the commissioner that the property is not ""a capital asset."" However, the Court finds that the building is not a ""capital asset"" and therefore does not suffer a capital Loss. On appeal, the Commissioner dissents. The only definition used by the legislature is ""propertiness,"" which means ""the value of something above its total liens."" It is understood that Congress intended to use this word when it meant ""equity."" Thus, we find that Congress did not intend to mean ""propersty,"" but rather ""equities."" Therefore, the words used in the Act do not refer to either physical or financial property; instead, they refer to the owner's rights to manage and dispose of those things. This confusion arises because Congress uses the word ""propherty"" so often in the legislative language that it would be confusing to interpret the meaning of such words. For example, under section 231, depreciations are permitted at gross income. If the mortgor has no interest in paying off the mortgage, then the amount of his debt can be adjusted according to the actual market value.

dissenting.
The Tax Court concluded that this taxpayer acquired only an equity worth nothing. The mortgage was in default, the mortgage debt was equal to the value of the property, any possession by the taxpayer was forfeited and terminable immediately by foreclosure, and perhaps by a receiver pendente lite. Arguments can be advanced to support the theory that the taxpayer received the whole property and thereupon came to owe the whole debt. Likewise it is argued that when she sold she transferred the entire value of the property and received release from the whole debt. But we think these arguments are not so conclusive that it was not within the province of the Tax Court to find that she received an equity which at that time had a zero value. Dobson v. Commissioner, 320 U. S. 489; Commissioner v. Scottish American Investment Co., Ltd., 323 U. S. 119. The taxpayer never became personally liable for the debt, and hence when she sold she was released from no debt. The mortgage debt was simply a subtraction from the value of what she did receive, and from what she sold. The subtraction left her nothing when she acquired it and a small margin when she sold it. She acquired a property right equivalent to an equity of redemption and sold the same thing. It was the “property” bought and sold as the Tax Court considered it to be under the Revenue Laws. We are not required in this case to decide whether depreciation was properly taken, for there is no issue about it here.

Petitionor appeals to the Court to reconsider the contract because it does not include overtime as required by the Act; the court disagrees. However, both cases do not differ in terms of the amount or frequency of payment. Both courts agree that the contract was intended to fix the regular hourly rate rather than fix the actual standard rate.

The Court disagrees with Justice Murphy's argument that the contract overtime rate had no effect on the employee's hours of work. If an employee works more than 78 hours in one week, then he is paid the regular amount. This means that even if an employee worked 40 hours or 80 hours in ten days, he will be paid the same amount. Furthermore, the Court has consistently held that the standard rate of compensation must reflect all payment received during the workday, exclusive of any overtime payments. Thus, when the parties decide how much wages are to be paid, they determine the regular rate by mathematical computation. When the parties choose the actual amount of wages, the determination of their regular rate becomes matter of mathematical calculation.

It concerns whether a veteran who has been reemployed for more than one year can be restored to seniority under the Selectives and Service Act as long as his employment continues. The question, however, is whether the veteran's seniority will extend beyond the first year after his reelection. In this case, the veterans are asked to maintain their seniority until the end of the year. They argue that it would take years for these rights to be extended because Congress did not intend to create such a system at all. However, they do concede that there may be some exceptions to this provision. For example, Whirlls, an employee who had served in the Navy during the war, was allowed to reinstate his seniority by the company on September 18, 1945. Although the company threatened to reduce his salary and seniority status, the employees were told that they would have to change their positions. After the trial court judgment, the district court and the federal appeals both ruled that the veteran could retain his ""prewar plus serviceaccumulated seniority.""

He contends that veteran rights are not necessarily limited by the time of service but must be extended throughout the entire year. This means that veterans who have been in the military for more than a year can still work as long as they remain at work. However, since Congress does not allow veterans to reduce their seniorities during the year, it is impossible for them to do so because they are veterans. The case begins with Whirl's reinstatement and his expulsion from the union. Because both companies were part of the American Federation of labor unions, the national authorities decided that each employee would retain his seniority under the contract when he rejoined either company. Both groups revolted and demanded their individual seniority. The smaller group tried to get recognition as an agent of the larger company; however, the bigger group won the election and forced the smaller group to become members of the C.I.O. union.

The court considers whether the state can levy taxes on property moved by interstate commerce as long as the owner's interests do not interfere with the movement of the goods. It is decided that there are two types of interruptions: 1) temporary interruptions caused by the necessity of the journey; and 2) temporary interruption due to the purpose of transportation. The first issue concerns whether states can impose taxes on land owned by merchants who move their goods from one state to another. The second issue concerns how the state may be able to impose these taxes without violating the Constitution's commerce clause. The First Amendment provides that states may not impose such taxes but that they may grant exemptions for certain purposes. The Second Amendment grants the state power to regulate the conduct of businesses within a state. The Third Amendment allows the state to enforce its laws when Congress has sufficient authority over the matter. The Supreme Court decides that the Pennsylvania Coal company must have been allowed to operate coal mines under contract to Erie Railroad instead of being a public entity. The owners of coal were now required to pay the annual coal-storage tax. This change was approved by the New York City Board of Trade in 1939. Under the terms of the agreement, Erie would lease Coalberg out to independent warehouses at a price that amounts to about $500 a month. The license fee is charged and collected every two years. After the purchase of coal, the distributors receive payment for the transportation charges. When the final product arrives at Coal Bergen, the railroad agent pays the freight agent. Once the shippers return to Coalber, the remaining coal goes to market in New Jersey where it is then sold. The third issue concerns what happens to the products once they arrive in New York. If the manufacturer sends them back to his plant, no one knows where they will go next. Finally, even if the owner wants to keep or sell the goods before they reach Coalborg, the owner does not have the right to do so until after the delivery of the coal. Thus, the only reason he might want to store his goods outside of New Jersey is because he needs to transport them to other states.

Mr. Justice Jackson,
concurring.
I concur in the opinion and result. But the issue here is so related to other problems that I desire to state my grounds.
I would be reluctant to adopt a construction of an Act, such as the Emergency Price Control Act, which would certainly impede its administration unless it were necessary to carry out the intent of Congress or to protect fundamental individual rights.
If the Administrator may not delegate his power to sign subpoenas but must personally sign all subpoenas issued in the process of enforcement throughout the United States, one of two practices would be certain to result. He might sign large batches of blank subpoenas and turn them over to subordinates to be filled in over his signature. Or he might sign batches of subpoenas already made out by subordinates, probably without reading them and certainly without examining the causes for their issuance or *124the scope of the information required. The personal signature of the Administrator on the subpoena under those circumstances is no protection to individual rights.
Of all the subpoenas issued by administrative authority, a very small percentage are contested. The important thing for protection of the individual is that when he does have reasons for resisting obedience he can obtain a hearing. I am in doubt as to whether under this Act and the regulations for its administration a person who has reasons for resisting the subpoena has any administrative review or remedy. But in any event he cannot be punished for contempt until a court order for its enforcement has issued and has been disobeyed.
Enforcement of such subpoenas by the courts is not and should not be automatic. So long as they are subject to full inquiry at this point it does not seem to me important to the individual or inconsistent with the policy of Congress that the subpoena issue by a subordinate of the Administrator. If the courts were to be shorn of their power of independent inquiry before enforcement, and I have thought we were tending that way, cf. dissent in Penfield Co. v. S. E. C., 330 U. S. 585, I should expect Congress to intend greater responsibility at the point of original issue. I concur only because I think adequate judicial safeguards exist.

It also prohibits civil officers from making searches in suspected places without proof of a specific crime. Madison states that General warrants should not be issued where an officer makes inquiries without evidence of any fact committed or seizing any person or property not specifically described and supported with evidence are grievous; and ought not be granted. However, New York has never had a constitutional safeguard against unreasonable searches since the First Amendment was passed after the Revolution. Because Congress realized that police abuse were continuing dangers, they put forth the provision on the Fourth amendment: ""The right of people to be secured in their persons houses, papers...and effects, against reasonable searches and seizures.""

It is important that the case cannot be brought to light because there was no jade evidence supporting the arrest of his criminal possessions. There were no prima jades evidence to support such a warrant; however, where no warrant had been issued, the Court has been insistent upon confining extremely narrowly the extent of search and seize. A search can only be limited under certain circumstances. For example, Gowen and Bartels were arrested while actually engaging in running an illicit saloon pursuant to a conspiracy. An individual was arrested when actually engaged in selling intoxicating alcohols and articles as well as other crimes. This case overruled the previous cases.

4027,9420004,104428,020lead,"In this paper, Douglas argues that two separate investigations by the Interstate Commerce Board of Governors in 1939 have resulted in unlawful discrimination on railroad class rates. First, the Board found that there was little uniformity in Class Rates within the different territories and that interterrorial class rates were not reasonable because differences in the rate scales affect the classes of freight as much as any other difference in the levels or patterns of class rates could be eliminated. Second, the board ordered that all interstate class charges be reduced 10 percent subject to qualifications no matter where they are located. Third, the new interim orders were ordered to come into effect January 1, 1946; the plaintiffs appealed to the District Court for relief. The first issue concerns whether the Act prohibits ""discriminations"" against a specific locality but does not include port district, gate, transit point. Congress further extended the prohibition under section 3 1) by adding the words ""region, district territory."" The Supreme Court held that these provisions did not amend the law but left it valid. Finally, the Ramspecker Resolution passed by Congress allowed the commission to examine prices between points in One Class Territory and points elsewhere and into Like Rates Within Territories for the purposes of finding whether such rates were ""unjust or unacceptable or unjustily discriminatory so/as to give unduly advantage,"" which is what the Act required. This amendment also added the word ""subject to prejudice or disadvantage,"" which means that the federal government cannot deny an unfair treatment to a particular region or territory without showing that the goods being transported are moving at higher class rates than those in another territory. However, the evidence supporting the claim that class rates do not harm shippers from Southern, South, West, and Eastern Trunk-line territories is sufficient to support the conclusion that the class rate structures would not remove features of current rate structure prejudicial to them.",1947-06-09,2.0

Although the court is concerned about the complicated nature and the limited scope of judicial review when dealing with such issues, it is nevertheless necessary to ask whether there is any discrimination under the Act. It cannot be abated by taking one percentage off one land and adding it on another. Even if one considers questions of equality in isolation, unfairness cannot be solved mechanically bytaking a percentage away from one territory and add it to another; it is no more equality to have equality everywhere.

Mr. Justice Murphy,
concurring.
While joining in the opinion of the Court, I believe that the importance of the problem raised by this case cannot be overemphasized. A free press lies at the heart of our democracy and its preservation is essential to the survival of liberty. Any inroad made upon the constitutional protection of a free press tends to undermine the freedom of all men to print and to read the truth.
In my view, the Constitution forbids a judge from summarily punishing a newspaper editor for printing an unjust attack upon him or his method of dispensing justice. The only possible exception is in the rare instance where the attack might reasonably cause a real impediment to the administration of justice. Unscrupulous and vindictive criticism of the judiciary is regrettable. But judges must not retaliate by a summary suppression of such criticism for they are bound by the command of the First Amendment. Any summary suppression of unjust criticism carries with it an ominous threat of summary suppression of all criticism. It is to avoid that threat that the First Amendment, as I view it, outlaws the summary contempt method of suppression.
Silence and a steady devotion to duty are the best answers to irresponsible criticism; and those judges who feel the need for giving a more visible demonstration of *384their feelings may take advantage of various laws passed for that purpose which do not impinge upon a free press. The liberties guaranteed by the First Amendment, however, are too highly prized to be subjected to the hazards of summary contempt procedure.

It is difficult for me to believe that the opinion of the Supreme Court of California is so ambiguous that the precise constitutional issues in this case have become too blurred for our powers of discernment.
The courts below and the parties involved have all acted on the assumption that the appellant Murdock was charged with having violated §§ 44.09 (a) and 44.12 of the Los Angeles Municipal Code. Now it is true that various other parts of the Code are interconnected with those sections and serve to complicate the picture somewhat. But the constitutional issues thereby raised seem clear to me. Simply stated, they are: (1) Does it violate the constitutional guarantee of freedom of religion to prohibit solicitors of religious charities from using boxes or receptacles in public places except by written permission of city officials? (2) Is that guarantee infringed by a requirement that such solictors display an information card issued by city officials?

We are of the opinion that the respondent, The Texas Mexican Railway Company, is the initial carrier under the bill of lading issued by it at Laredo for carriage of the articles to El Oro, Mexico. The bill of lading issued by the Pennsylvania Railroad was for carriage from Sharon, Pennsylvania, to Laredo, Texas. Accepting the interpretation of the Court, that this Pennsylvania bill required the delivery of the shipment by the respondent at the International Boundary in Laredo, there remains the necessity of causing the shipment to cross the boundary line and proceed upon its journey into Mexico. As the Court concedes, the bill of lading, sued upon here, was *736used to clear “the shipment with the Mexican customs.” It is also plain that it was this latter bill that caused the shipment to cross the line. Without it, the respondent could not have made delivery to the Mexican railway system. The Pennsylvania bill of lading called for delivery to the consignee’s agent in Laredo, Fausto Trevino. The consideration to respondent for its issue would be a similar service for northbound shipments from the Mexican Railways or promotion of respondent’s export business.
The Ward case, 244 U. S. 383, is not an authority for the Court’s holding. There the suit was brought on a through bill from a Texas point to an Oklahoma point. The defense was that a new contract had been made with a connecting carrier. It was said, p. 387:
“The bill of lading required to be issued by the initial carrier upon an interstate shipment governs the entire transportation. The terms of the original bill of lading were not altered by the second issued by the connecting carrier. As appellants were already bound to transport the cattle at the rate and upon the terms named in the original bill of lading, the acceptance by the shipper of the second bill was without consideration and was void.”
The facts of this case seem to us entirely different and to require that the respondent railway accept responsibility as the initial carrier.

As the opinion of the Court points out, the Form B contract involved in the present case was adopted, with the approval of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, *133after it had been held under an earlier form of contract that members of the orchestra were employees of the band leader. On the face of the present contract the dance hall proprietor is the employer even under traditional concepts of master and servant. For he has all of the conventional earmarks of the entrepreneur — ownership, profit, loss, and control — if the provisions of the contract alone are considered. Then the requirements of the Social Security Act are satisfied. And to hold the dance hall proprietor liable for the tax is not to contract the coverage contemplated by the statutory scheme.
I think the tax collector should be entitled to take such private arrangements at their face. In other situations a taxpayer may not escape the tax consequences of the business arrangements which he makes on the grounds that they are fictional. The Government may “sustain or disregard the effect of the fiction as best serves the purposes of the tax statute.” Higgins v. Smith, 308 U. S. 473, 477. That rule is not restricted in its application to the use by taxpayers of corporate or related devices to obtain tax advantages. It was applied in Gray v. Powell, 314 U. S. 402, where a railroad sought exemption from the Bituminous Coal Act by contending that the operations of one who appeared to be an independent contractor were in fact its operations. The Court in rejecting the contention said that “The choice of disregarding a deliberately chosen arrangement for conducting business affairs does not lie with the creator of the plan.” Id., 414. I see no reason for creating an exception to that rule here. If the Government chooses to accept the contract on its face, the parties should be barred from showing that it conceals the real arrangement. Tax administration should not be so easily embarrassed.

In Adamson v. California, this day decided, ante p. 46, the Court waters down the Fourteenth Amendment’s application to the states of the Bill of Rights guarantee against self-incrimination so as to make it compatible with the Court’s standards of decency and a fair trial. In this case the Court similarly waters down the Bill of *140Rights guarantee of counsel in criminal cases. In both cases, the Court refuses to strike down convictions obtained in disregard of Bill of Rights guarantees, assuming all the while that identical convictions obtained in federal courts would violate the Bill of Rights. For the Court, in the instant case, concedes that, by virtue of the Sixth Amendment, “counsel must be furnished an indigent defendant prosecuted in a federal court in every case, whatever the circumstances.” This, of course, relates to con.victions following both pleas of not guilty and pleas of guilty. Williams v. Kaiser, 323 U. S. 471; Tomkins v. Missouri, 323 U. S. 485.
In the Adamson case, I have voiced my objections to dilution of constitutional protections against self-incrimination in state courts. This decision is another example of the consequences which can be produced by substitution of this Court’s day-to-day opinion of what kind of trial is fair and decent for the kind of trial which the Bill of Rights guarantees. This time it is the right of counsel. We cannot know what Bill of Rights provision will next be attenuated by the Court. We can at least be sure that there will be more, so long as the Court adheres to the doctrine of this and the Adamson case.
The Court’s decision relies heavily on Betts v. Brady, 316 U. S. 455. In that case, a man on relief, too poor to hire a lawyer, and whose request for the appointment of a lawyer was denied, was compelled to act as his own lawyer on a charge of robbery. Conviction followed. That case is precedent for this one. But it is the kind of precedent that I had hoped this Court would not perpetuate.
One thing more. The Court seems to fear that protecting these defendants’ right to counsel to the full extent defined in the Bill of Rights would furnish “opportunities hitherto uncontemplated for opening wide the prison doors of the land,” because, presumably, there are many *141people like Betts, Foster and Payne behind those doors after trials without having had the benefit of counsel. I do not believe that such a reason is even relevant to a determination that we should decline to enforce the Bill of Rights.

Me. Justice Douglas,
with whom Mr. Justice Black and Mr. Justice Murphy concur, dissenting.
For the reasons stated in my separate opinion in Hust v. Moore-McCormack Lines, 328 U. S. 707, 734, I think that respondents were owners pro hac vice of the vessel, since the business of managing and operating it was their business. They were, therefore, principals and liable to petitioner, a longshoreman who was injured while working on the deck of the vessel by reason of the breaking of a cargo boom, part of the ship’s gear.
The Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has reached the same result in a case decided since Hust v. Moore-McCormack Lines. In Militano v. United States, 156 F. 2d 599, that court held that the agent under the same form of operating agreement as we have here was owner pro hac vice. Swan, J., speaking for the court, said in reference to the Hust case, p. 602, “If the agent remains the employer sufficiently to be liable to members of the crew under the Jones Act, we think it cannot escape the duties of an owner pro hac vice in other respects. Thus it has the duty to furnish stevedores with a safe place to work, a duty which is analogous to that owed by a landowner to a business visitor.”
*161The Court does not essay to answer that argument; nor does it address itself to the facts which I reviewed in the Hust case and which establish that the business of managing and operating the vessel was the business of the agent. It avoids analysis of the actual arrangement by viewing with alarm the consequences to the Government of such a holding as applied in other situations. But we are here concerned with private rights which press for recognition. It is no answer to the legal argument on which those private rights rest that the Government might' be inconvenienced if they were recognized. It is plain under this operating agreement that the United States is merely the underwriter of the financial risks of the venture while the private operator performs the managerial functions in the usual way. To call that government operation is to ignore the realities of the relationship. Whatever the consequences in other situations, it is shocking to find private operators getting immunity in this manner from their traditional liability for tort claims.

  delivered the opinion of the Court.
 

  This petition by John H. Fahey, individually and as Federal Home Loan Bank Commissioner, and A. V. Ammann, individually and as Conservator for the Long Beach Federal Savings and Loan Association, invokes the original jurisdiction of this Court. They ask leave to file petition for a writ of “mandamus and/or prohibition and/or injunction” against Judge Peirson M.

  v.
  
   Mallonee,
  
  decided today,
  
   ante,
  
  p. 245, to prohibit any further allowance therein, and to enjoin any payments heretofore allowed.
 

  While an appeal in the principal case was pending in this Court, application was made by various counsel for the plaintiffs and associated interests therein for allowance of fees aggregating some $125,000. The District Court allowed counsel for plaintiffs $50,000 as a partial payment on account of services, but withheld action on other applications. Certain costs and expenses of the plaintiffs in the amount of $17,295.13 were also ordered reimbursed.
 

  The petition involves serious questions of law and of fact. Whether, because of the pendency of the appeal and the stay order granted therein, the District Court had power to entertain the application, whether before the final outcome of the case could be known an allowance was premature, whether the source of the fund on deposit with the court was so related to the services as to be subject to disbursement for their compensation, and whether one judge can make allowances in a case before a three-judge court, are, with other questions, much contested. We do not decide any question as to the merits.
 

  Mandamus, prohibition and injunction against judges are drastic and extraordinary remedies. We do not doubt
   
   *260
   
  power in a proper case to issue such writs. But they have the unfortunate consequence of making the judge a litigant, obliged to obtain personal counsel or to leave his defense to one of the litigants before him. These remedies should be resorted to only where appeal is a clearly inadequate remedy. We are unwilling to utilize them as substitutes for appeals. As extraordinary remedies, they are reserved for really extraordinary causes.
 

  We find nothing in this case to warrant their use. An allowance of $50,000 will hardly destroy a twenty-six-million-dollar association during the time it would take to prosecute an appeal. The status of one of the applicants in the principal case is now settled so that he has standing to take all authorized appeals. We hold that the applicants’ grievance is one to be pursued by appeal at the proper time and to the appropriate court, rather than by resort to our original jurisdiction for extraordinary writs.

The district court granted judgment in favor of the government but dismissed all claims against Etzel as tortious interference with the relationship between the government and the soldier.

Thus, the case is neither one of state interests nor exclusive for determination by states law within the purpose of the clearfield case. Instead, it is ""federal common-law"" used as a replacement for state law when dealing with disputes involving federal character. Therefore, there is no need for federal law to govern these cases.

For example, some situations require uniform national treatment; others involve matters that are not subject to federal control.

Mr. Justice Jackson,
dissenting.
If the defendant in this case had been held liable for negligently inflicting personal injuries on a civilian, it would have been obliged to pay, among other items of damage, the reasonable cost of resulting care by his doctor, hospital and nurse, and the earnings lost during the period of disability. If the civilian bore this cost himself, it would be part of his own damage; if the civilian were a wife and the expense fell upon her husband, he would be entitled to recover it; if the civilian were a child, it would be recoverable by the parent. The long-established law is that a wrongdoer who commits a tort against a civilian must make good to somebody these elements of the costs resulting from his wrongdoing.
What the Court now holds is that if the victim of negligence is a soldier, the wrongdoer does not have to make good these items of expense to the one who bears them. The United States is under the duty to furnish medical services, hospitalization and nursing to a soldier and loses his services while his pay goes on. These costs, which essentially fall upon the United States by reason of the sovereign-soldier relationship, the Court holds cannot be recovered by the United States from the wrongdoer as the parent can in the case of a child or the husband can in the case of a wife. As a matter of justice, I see no reason why taxpayers of the United States should relieve a wrongdoer of part of his normal liability for personal *318injury when the victim of negligence happens to be a soldier. And I cannot see why the principles of tort law that allow a husband or parent to recover do not logically sustain the right of the United States to recover in this case.
But the Court has qualms about applying these well-known principles of tort law to this novel state of facts, unless directed to do so by Congress. The law of torts has been developed almost exclusively by the judiciary in England and this country by common law methods. With few exceptions, tort liability does not depend upon legislation. If there is one function which I should think we would feel free to exercise under a Constitution which vests in us judicial power, it would be to apply well-established common law principles to a case whose only novelty is in facts. The courts of England, whose scruples against legislating are at least as sensitive as ours normally are, have not hesitated to say that His Majesty’s Treasury may recover outlay to cure a British soldier from injury by a negligent wrongdoer and the wages he was meanwhile paid.

4091,9420056,104469,020lead,"The case is brought against three companies: National Lead Company, Titan Inc and du Pont de Nestors and Company. Each company has violated the antitrust Act by committing a conspiracy to restrain trade and commerce among the states or foreign nations. The Court decides that each company has committed an illegal combination of conspirators under the Antitrust act. It also finds that both companies have engaged in ""a combination"" in restrainting trade between the States and foreign countries. The court concludes that these two companies are guilty of violating the Sherman Act because they have used their patents to control the entire market. The district court determines that this agreement was offensive to antitrust laws as it allowed them to continue the dominance of the marketplace which they had achieved through the international agreements. The decree provides for licenses at reasonable royalties on all patents covered within five years after the date of its execution. Both parties agree to grant exclusive licenses to each other; however, neither party will question or contest any patents of another party under the same contract. In 1932, national lead acquired an eight-7% interest in TAS Co.A/S but jebsen retained 13%. This means that four major companies -- National Lear, Titanium Inc., Du Pont de Nemorse and Company, and I.G. Farbenindustrie -- now own about nine percent of the domestic titanium pigment market. These companies compete vigorously with each other's competitors. They argue that there is no reason for adding a provision forcing either company to submit a detailed plan for divestiture from their stockholding",1947-11-10,1.0

Mr. Justice Jackson,

I would affirm the decision of the court below. If crop insurance contracts made by agencies of the United States Government are to be judged by the law of the State in which they are written, I find no error in the court below. *387If, however, we are to hold them subject only to federal law and to declare what that law is, I can see no reason why we should not adopt a rule which recognizes the practicalities of the business.
It was early discovered that fair dealing in the insurance business required that the entire contract between the policyholder and the insurance company be embodied in the writings which passed between the parties, namely, the written application, if any, and the policy issued. It may be well enough to make some types of contracts with the Government subject to long and involved regulations published in the Federal Register. To my mind, it is an absurdity to hold that every farmer who insures his crops knows what the Federal Register contains or even knows that there is such a publication. If he were to peruse this voluminous and dull publication as it is issued from time to time in order to make sure whether anything has been promulgated that affects his rights, he would never need crop insurance, for he would never get time to plant any crops. Nor am I convinced that a reading of technically-worded regulations would enlighten him much in any event.
In this case, the Government entered a field which required the issuance of large numbers of insurance policies to people engaged in agriculture. It could not expect them to be lawyers, except in rare instances, and one should not be expected to have to employ a lawyer to see whether his own Government is issuing him a policy which in case of loss would turn out to be no policy at all. There was no fraud or concealment, and those who represented the Government in taking on the risk apparently no more suspected the existence of a hidden regulation that would render the contract void than did the policyholder. It is very well to say that those who deal with the Government should turn square corners. But *388there is no reason why the square corners should constitute a one-way street.
The Government asks us to lift its policies out of the control of the States and to find or fashion a federal rule to govern them. I should respond to that request by laying down a federal rule that would hold these agencies to the same fundamental principles of fair dealing that have been found essential in progressive states to prevent insurance from being an investment in disappointment.

The respondent's return indicates that its tax liability is $1,1932; however, the revenue agent later assesses the amount at $6,640 in order to reduce the debt. The court dismisses his claim on the basis that the provisions of the tax law specifically exempt from all forms of taxes except income, war profits, excess profits, estate or gift taxes. However, the Tenth Court of  appeals rejects the claim because the statute does not explicitly exempt any form of taxes. It furthermore provides that claims for refund should be presented within four years from when the return was first filed or within 2 years after the date of paid the tax. This provision has long been part of federal legislation. It was introduced in 1872 as a means for collecting and remitting internal revenue taxes alleged by mistaken or illegal assessment or collection. Section 3228 established a procedure ""for filing claims for relief of any inner revenue tax allegedly to have been ""erronenous or illegally collected"" and creates a limitation time of two years before the cause of actions accrued. Later, sections 252 and 252 were changed so that those who had agreed to pay the tax will not be required to make such claims. Thus, the only significant change made in the interval between the payment of money and the final assessment was a reduced period of limitations. For example, the income tax applies only to payments ""in excess of what is properly due."" Overpayments may be traceable to errors in mathematics or judgment or in interpretation of facts or laws.

I agree with the result in this case, but the arguments that have been addressed to us lead me to utter more explicit misgivings about war powers than the Court has done. The Government asserts no constitutional basis for this legislation other than this vague, undefined and undefinable “war power.”
No one will question that this power is the most dangerous one to free government in the whole catalogue of powers. It usually is invoked in haste and excitement when calm legislative consideration of constitutional limitation is difficult. It is executed in a time of patriotic fervor that makes moderation unpopular. And, worst of all, it is interpreted by judges under the influence of the same passions and pressures. Always, as in this case, the Government urges hasty decision to forestall some emergency or serve some purpose and pleads that paralysis will result if its claims to power are denied or their confirmation delayed.
Particularly when the. war power is invoked to do things to the liberties of people, or to their property or economy that only indirectly affect conduct of the war and do not *147relate to the management of the war itself, the constitutional basis should be scrutinized with care.
I think we can hardly deny that the war power is as valid a ground for federal rent control now as it has been at any time. We still are technically in a state of war. I would not be willing to hold that war powers may be indefinitely prolonged merely by keeping legally alive a state of war that had in fact ended. I cannot accept the argument that war powers last as long as the effects and consequences of war, for if so they are permanent — as permanent as the war debts. But I find no reason to conclude that we could find fairly that the present state of war is merely technical. We have armies abroad exercising our war power and have made no peace terms with our allies, not to mention our principal enemies. I think the conclusion that the war power has been applicable during the lifetime of this legislation is unavoidable.

I am unable to join in the Court’s opinion or in its disposition of the petition. In my judgment neither the action taken by the Supreme Court of Oklahoma nor that of the District Court of Cleveland County, following upon the decision and issuance of our mandate in No. 369, Sipuel v. Board of Regents, 332 U. S. 631, is consistent with our opinion in that cause or therefore with our mandate which issued forthwith.1
It is possible under those orders for the state’s officials to dispose of petitioner’s demand for a legal education equal to that afforded to white students by establishing overnight a separate law school for Negroes or to continue affording the present advantages to white students while denying them to petitioner. The latter could be done either by excluding all applicants for admission to the first-year class of the state university law school after the date of the District Court’s order or, depending upon the meaning of that order, by excluding such applicants and asking all first-year students enrolled prior to that order’s date to withdraw from school.
Neither of those courses, in my opinion, would comply with our mandate. It plainly meant, to me at any *152rate, that Oklahoma should end the discrimination practiced against petitioner at once, not at some later time, near or remote. It also meant that this should be done, if not by excluding all students, then by affording petitioner the advantages of a legal education equal to those afforded to white students. And in my comprehension the equality required was equality in fact, not in legal fiction.
Obviously no separate law school could be established elsewhere overnight capable of giving petitioner a legal education equal to that afforded by the state’s long-established and well-known state university law school. Nor could the necessary time be taken to create such facilities, while continuing to deny them to petitioner, without incurring the delay which would continue the discrimination our mandate required to end at once. Neither would the state comply with it by continuing to deny the required legal education to petitioner while affording it to any other student, as it could do by excluding only students in the first-year class from the state university law school.
Since the state courts’ orders allow the state authorities at their election to pursue alternative courses, some of which do not comply with our mandate, I think those orders inconsistent with it. Accordingly I dissent from the Court’s opinion and decision in this case.

 The mandate reversed the Oklahoma Supreme Court’s judgment and remanded the cause to it “for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.”

He argues that the Constitution's separation principle is ""the beginning of thesolution of a problems, not its answers."" The history of religious instruction in America begins with the adoption of the First Amendment in 1875. Church schools were initially forbidden because they were taught under sectarian authority; however, by 1907, many states began to allow religious instruction outside school buildings. This was an attempt to reconcile religion with the separation between the government and the people. However, some critics claimed that these restrictions were too strict for minority groups. Finally, President Grant wrote into the constitution that every state should have a free school system without sectarianism. Thus, every state has been required to write into their constitution a prohibition on the use of money for sectary education. Religious teachers were naturally concerned about how children would be educated when they were away from home. Some denominations tried to obtain funds for religious institutions but were unsuccessful. One day, Dr. George Unneither suggested that Sunday school be held on Wednesday afternoons instead of Saturday or Sunday school. After several attempts, the weekday church school became a reality in New York city. It was proposed that parents could excuse their children from public school one day per week so that churches could provide Sunday school on Wednesday.

The plaintiff wants the court to order the board to prohibit all forms of teaching that suggest or recognize that there is God.

Mr. Justice Frankfurter,
concurring.
I had supposed that no rule of judicial administration was better settled than that the Court should restrict itself to the questions presented in a petition for certiorari. This is especially true where, as here, the petition was granted but “limited to the question as to the statute of limitations presented by the petition for the writ,” 332 U. S. 835, and the case was transferred to the summary docket. The exceptions to this rule are rare, as where the jurisdiction of this Court or of the lower courts is plainly wanting, or where a patent error in javorem vitae is to be noted. In any event, it is clear that this case could not be one of them. The exclusive jurisdiction provisions of the Emergency Price Control Act may well preclude our consideration of the validity of the “retroactive order.” But since an issue other than that pertaining to the statute of limitations has been dealt with, I would like to add a few words to Mr. Justice Jackson’s opinion, inasmuch as his immoderate restraint does not lay bare the “merits” of the controversy.
The crux of the matter is that where a landlord rents new housing accommodations but, as here, disobeys the regulatory scheme and fails to file a registration statement, if he chooses to collect the rent that he himself has *479fixed, he can do so only contingently. The Administrator may catch up with him and fix what was the proper amount from the beginning. The excess is illegal and must therefore be refunded.
There is nothing novel about a regulatory scheme whereby landlords who violate the law are denied the right to profit thereby. It has consistently been upheld by the Emergency Court of Appeals. 150 East 47th Street Corp. v. Creedon, 162 F. 2d 206; see Senderowitz v. Clark, 162 F. 2d 912, 917; cf. Easley v. Fleming, 159 F. 2d 422. When Congress provided in § 2 (g) of the Act that regulations “may contain such provisions as the Administrator deems necessary to prevent the circumvention or evasion thereof,” 56 Stat. 23, 27, 50 U. S. C. (Supp. V, 1946) § 902 (g), it plainly authorized effective administrative remedies for dealing with evasion.
If such an order is to be termed “retroactive,” it comes within the Court's recent ruling that “such retroactivity must be balanced against the mischief of producing a result which is contrary to a statutory design or to legal and equitable principles. If that mischief is greater than the ill effect of the retroactive application of a new standard, it is not the type of retroactivity which is condemned by law.” Securities & Exchange Commission v. Chenery Corp., 332 U. S. 194, 203.

Then we would wait *73to see which of the alternatives was ultimately selected or imposed before reviewing the constitutionality of any of them. But there would be no more reason to defer decision on the merits in that case than in this. For the constitutional questions would be isolated in each and we would be as uncertain in one as in the other which of the alternatives would actually apply to appellant. And the principle seems to me to be the same even when a majority of us would sustain the order whatever alternative was chosen as its sanction.
There is, of course, in the one case the chance of saving the order only if one remedy rather than another is chosen, while in the other the order would survive whichever was chosen. But in each we would be giving needless constitutional dissertations on some points. That is nonetheless true in a case where the constitutional questions seem to a majority of us simple, uncomplicated and of no great dignity. For the single constitutional question necessary for decision will not be isolated until the precise pinch of the order on the appellant is known. It will not be known in the present case at least until appellant elects or is required (1) to shut down, (2) to become a carrier of the Peerless gas, or (3) to purchase it.
The legal, as well as the economic, relationship which Republic will bear to Peerless will vary as one or another choice is made. To make Republic a “carrier” is to submit it to different business risks than to make it a “purchaser.” The fact that each would raise only questions of “due process” under the Fourteenth Amendment does not mean that the questions are identical. Even when reasonableness is the test, judges have developed great contrariety of opinions. The point is that today the variables are presented only in the abstract. Tomorrow the facts will be known, when the precise impact of the order on appellant will be determined. Thus to me the *74policy against premature constitutional adjudication precludes us from saying the judgment in the present case is “final.”

4210,9420159,104548,040dissent,"The Supreme Court's decision in this case is a final order that will not prolong the long-running lawsuit. Republic Natural Gas company, which has been producing gas in the area for many years, appeals to the Oklahoma corporate commission to allow it to take and pay for gas as between Peerless1 and Republic. The state court orders Republic to make an immediate purchase of gas at a fixed price. In the event that Republic does not agree on terms, the commission must issue another order fixing these terms. The majority believes that the parties have not yet agreed upon terms or conditions of the purchase. However, there may be further orders required before all the issues are resolved. It is important to note that the Nebraska court's judgment was not final because it did not involve any further proceedings; rather, it was merely ""a multiple litigating allowing review"" of the entire proceeding. This means that both sides would have to decide whether they want to proceed with the purchase or shut down of production. If either party wants to go ahead with the purchasing or shutting down process, then neither party will be able to do so. Finally, the question facing each party is whether the order deprived of finality until such decisions are made. Both parties argue that the order cannot be final until one option is made: either Republic can buy or sell natural gas from other private producers. Although the Constitution allows states to regulate property rights in accord with their local needs and circumstances, republic denies the right to do this since the state has no power to curtail unqualified rights.

The plaintiffs allege that Schine pooled its entire buying power in order to negotiate films from the various distributors so that they could combine their closed and open-town theatres into one. The district court finds that the defendants conspired between themselves and with eight major movie distributors to violate the Act's prohibition on ""monopoly power."" The District Court finds that these conspiracy was not immuniized by reason that the members of the group were closely affiliated than independent. The lawsuit also challenges several other claims made by the district court: 1) that Schlein arbitrarily denied independents first-run pictures; 2) that it forced or threatened to force competitors outside of business; and 3) that some of the companies did not buy out contracts not to compete long enough for longer terms of years. These claims are supported by evidence that Schinne obtained preferential concessions through the franchising agreements as well as special film rental concessions. Finally, the appealers argue that there are two interpretations of the definition of reasonableness used by the federal court -- one innocent and one unlawful. They do not deny that any price cutting is illegal under the Act because it would be an instrument of robbery. However, the courts find that many of the provisions of the settlement agreement were unreasonable.

The court finds two price fixing conspiracys: one between all of the three defendants; and another between each of the four majors and its licenseers. The Districtcourt finds that these conspiracie are unlawful because they involve ""two price fixing"" agreements. Price-fixing is illegal under the Act because it involves fixed prices for an exhibitor's product at a specific price. Each exhibitor agrees to keep a specified minimum price on admission to any theater owned by the same distributor. The district court also finds that there are no clearances between theatres involved in substantial competition or between them. These restrictions are unreasonable because they do not relate to competitive factors. The only reasonable justification for clearings is the special need of the licenseer for the competitive advantage it affords him. He rejects the suggestion that some of these restrictions would be applied to a manufacturer who had been part of the scheme. The evidence shows that most of the plaintiffs have joint ownership of their theaters. This means that both parties can acquire interests from each other without having to give up control of the entire company. It furthermore suggests that many of these deals were used as devices to dissuade competitors from competing against others. Finally, the district court finds that blockbooking is unfair because it allows independents to compete against larger groups of exhibitors. Discrimination occurs when the contract provisions allow large privileges such as the selection and eliminated of films. The courts find that these provisions violate the copyright law which makes reward to owners a primary consideration.

This act allowed the commission to approve a voluntary railway agreement only if three things were met: 1) ""will be conforming with the public interests; 2) will be just and reasonably; and 3) will not cause an unreasonable burden on the carrier's ability to carry out its service; and finally, 4) will not interfere with the performance of the carriers' business.

Mr. Justice Frankfurter,
dissenting.
I agree with the views of Mr. Justice Jackson that, in the light of all the long-drawn-out prior proceedings, the two lower courts justifiably found the fourth petition for habeas corpus in this case without merit on its face. It is not too much to ask the petitioner to state, however informally, that his fourth petition is based on newly discovered matter, or, in any event, on a claim that he could not fairly have been asked to bring to the court’s attention in his three prior petitions. Such a requirement certainly does not narrow the broad protection which the writ of habeas corpus serves. I also agree with his general attitude against a prisoner being brought from Alcatraz — or any other federal prison — to argue his own case *295on appeal. My difference with him is that I would not bolt the door to such an undesirable practice, as a matter of law, but merely leave it as a rigorous rule of practice. The power to depart from this rule ought not to be wholly foreclosed, even though opportunity for its exercise is left for contingencies not easily foreseeable.
The office of the writ of habeas corpus precludes definitive formulation of its limitations precisely because it is the prerogative writ available for vindicating liberties. See Sunal v. Large, 332 U. S. 174, 184, 187. Therefore, I would not preclude the use of the writ to bring a convict before a circuit court of appeals where circumstances in the interests of justice make his presence compelling. See Adams v. United States ex rel. McCann, 317 U. S. 269, 272-75. It is a very different thing to judge the use of the writ for the purpose of having an incarcerated petitioner argue his own case on appeal by the ordinary standards of judicial discretion. To acknowledge such power in the circuit courts of appeals implies too broad an authority, in that the abuse of its exercise in granting the writ is too narrow a basis for review. A general rule should preclude the use of the writ for the purpose of taking a prisoner out of confinement merely to argue his own case on appeal from dismissal of a petition for habeas corpus after conviction. Every legitimate right of such a prisoner can be safeguarded by means much more consonant with the fair and seemly and wise administration of justice.

The question is whether certain regulations are valid under proper interpretation of Congress's statutes. A duly appointed civil service employee, petitioner, was fired from his position as a leadingman shipfitter on October 7, 1946 because it was necessary for him to eliminate certain jobs in his competition level. He was then told that he would have to stay in furlough status for one year rather than being separated from service. After receiving this notice, petitioners complaint against the Civil Service Board and the Navy were dismissed. The court ruled that the definition of ""A-l Plus"" included veterans who had an efficiency rating greater than ""good."" However, the Court disagreed with the Government's claim that all veterans could qualify for this classification. It also rejected the argument that even if these veterans were invalid, they would still fall within the category of ""sub group A-l,"" which includes those veterans who did not have an efficiency score higher than ""Good."" Petitioner appeals to the Supreme Court's interpretation of the Veterans' Preference Act by asserting that the provisions do not apply to returning veterans but to private employers. In particular, the Federal Government does not need to restore veterans to their old positions without cause for at least one year. Furthermore, unlike the fishgold case, federal law does not require veteran veterans to be restored to their former jobs before they can be discharged. Instead, Congress has explicitly provided that veterans must be reinstated to their previous jobs with the United States after serving a year or more. Thus, although Congress may have intended to make such a change, it is clear that there are significant differences in military and private employment practices and possibleities that might lead a employer to resign a veteran back to his former job. Finally, however, the Constitution does not prohibit any preference between veterans and other competing employees. Therefore, the section requires that veterans retain their preference when they have longer service.

I agree with the conclusion reached by the Court in this case. My disagreement with the opinion is limited *340to that portion of subdivision Second which indicates that the rights of a veteran as to discharge after restoration to employment by the United States differ from the corresponding rights of a veteran restored to employment by a private employer.
The rights to retention of employment of both veterans are governed by the same subsection 8 (c). 54 Stat. 890, 50 U. S. C. § 308. Section 8 (c) specifies the same conditions for retention of employment for all employees whether they are reemployed by the United States or by private employers.
Nothing has come to my attention that indicates to me a congressional purpose to grant to one more rights as to continuity of employment than to the other. The legislation as to both depended upon the same constitutional authority — the War Power. I can see no reason to attribute to Congress an intention to guarantee public employment to a returning veteran regardless of the needs of the public service or to discriminate between equally deserving veterans.

I agree with the result and the Court's opinion, subject to one interpretation or qualification of the opinion’s Fifth part.
The requirement that owners of boats fishing in the maritime belt dock at a South Carolina port, unload, pack, and stamp their catch (for tax purposes), before “shipping or transporting it to another state,” is not merely a regu*410lation of commerce burdening it in the sense of materially increasing the shipper’s costs. Many valid regulations of commerce do this. The regulation in question goes farther. It is aimed in terms directly at interstate commerce alone, and thus would seem to be discriminatory in intent and effect upon that commerce. Moreover, in my opinion, it is of such a character that, if applied, for all practical purposes it would block the commerce.
Since it was exactly that sort of state regulation the commerce clause was designed to strike down, I agree that this one cannot stand. The same considerations I also think would be applicable to nullify the license fees levied against nonresidents, since upon the record their transportation of catches would seem to be exclusively in interstate commerce, or practically so.

Where life is at stake one cannot be too careful. I’s had better be dotted and t’s crossed. And so I deem it proper to state my understanding of the opinion of the Court, on the basis of which I concur in it.
We granted certiorari to review a decision of the Supreme Court of California which dismissed habeas corpus proceedings brought in that court. We did so on the assumption that the case raised questions under the Fourteenth Amendment — more particularly, whether an unre-viewable determination by the superintendent of a State hospital, that one convicted of murder and found to have become insane after conviction had been restored to sanity and therefore was subject to execution, was consistent with the due process which the Fourteenth Amendment secures. The Court now finds that all that the California Supreme Court did was to hold that as a matter of California procedure the petitioner’s claim could not be passed on by the direct remedy of habeas corpus, but that there is available a special local remedy, labeled mandamus, whereby the petitioner can judicially test his present sanity. In short, the Court dismisses the writ of certiorari because the decision of the court below rests on *445a purely State ground in that there is a State remedy available, which has not been pursued, by means of which he can secure the rights he claims under the United States Constitution.
Of course I recognize the weight to be attached to the Attorney General’s views regarding the law of California. But the controlling voice on California law is that of the Supreme Court of California. Whatever may be the elegancies of procedure by which the matter is to be determined, our decision declining to consider the grave constitutional issues which we thought we had before us, is contingent upon a determination by the Supreme Court of California that the law of that State is what our decision presupposes it to be, namely, that California by a remedy which California chooses to call mandamus enables the present petitioner to secure a judicial determination of his present sanity. This means, of course, not the very restricted scope of relief which is normally associated with the traditional remedy of mandamus. It presupposes that California affords petitioner the means of challenging in a substantial way the ex parte finding of the Superintendent of the State Hospital for the Insane and enables him to secure judicial determination of the claims he has made in his petition for habeas corpus which, so the Court now holds, is not the proper way to proceed.
Upon this view I concur in the decision and opinion of the Court.

The protection against compulsory self-incrimination, guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment, is nullified to whatever extent this Court holds that Congress may require a citizen to keep an account of his deeds and misdeeds and turn over or exhibit the record on demand of government inspectors, who then can use it to convict him. Today’s decision introduces a principle of considerable moment. Of course, it strips of protection only business men and their records; but we cannot too often remind ourselves of the tendency of such a principle, once approved, to expand itself in practice “to the limits of its logic.” That it has already expanded to cover a vast *71area is apparent from the Court’s citation of twenty-six federal statutes that present parallels to the situation here under review. It would, no doubt, simplify enforcement of all criminal laws if each citizen were required to keep a diary that would show where he was at all times, with whom he was, and what he was up to. The decision of today, applying this rule not merely to records specially required under the Act but also to records “customarily kept,” invites and facilitates that eventuality.
The practice approved today obviously narrows the protections of the Fifth Amendment. We should not attribute to Congress such a purpose or intent unless it used language so mandatory and unmistakable that it left no alternative, and certainly should not base that inference on “legislative history” of such dubious meaning as exists in this case. Congress, if we give its language plain and usual meaning, has guarded the immunity so scrupulously as to raise no constitutional question. But if Congress had overstepped, we should have no hesitation in holding that the Government must lose some cases rather than the people lose their immunities from compulsory self-incrimination. However, in this case, the plain language of Congress requires no such choice. It does require, in my view, that this judgment be reversed.

  In response to specific interrogatories, the jury absolved the respondent of liability under the Boiler Inspection Act, but found that there had been such negligence as to create liability under the Federal Employers’ Liability Act. It returned a verdict for petitioner. Judgment was entered upon the verdict.
 

  The respondent moved the Court to set aside the verdict and the judgment entered thereon in accordance with its motion for directed verdict under Rule 50 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The judgment was vacated; the verdict set aside, and judgment entered in favor of the respondent. The District Court was of the opinion that there was no evidence upon which a finding of negligence could be predicated, and that, in any event, there was no evidence of a causal relation between the claimed negligence and the accident. 71 F. Supp. 764.
 

  Upon appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, the judgment was affirmed. A rehearing was granted, and there was an affirmance with one judge dissenting. 164 F. 2d 996.

  to Eckenrode’s death? Upon consideration of the record, the Court is of the opinion that there is no evidence, nor any inference which reasonably may be drawn from the evidence, when viewed in a light most favorable to the petitioner, which can sustain a recovery for her.

The result of this decision, no matter how it is rationalized, is to give the water-power value of the current of a river to a private party who by reason of federal law neither has nor can acquire any lawful claim to it. The United States has asserted through the Federal Power Act its exclusive dominion and control over this water power.1 That Act specifies how one may acquire *376a license to exploit it, § 23 (b), and the conditions under which the licensee must operate. See First Iowa Coop. v. Federal Power Comm’n, 328 U. S. 152.
Petitioner has such a license. Respondent has none and, for reasons unnecessary to relate here, concededly cannot obtain one. Respondent therefore has no claim to the water-power value which the law can recognize, if the policy of the Federal Power Act is to be respected. When respondent’s claim is recognized, the effect is to make petitioner pay a private claimant for a privilege which only the United States can grant.
That is the bald result whether the condemnation takes place in a state or a federal court. Whatever the procedure, the consequence is to give private parties an entrenched property interest in the public domain, which the Federal Power Act was designed to defeat.
The public burden is the same and the impairment of the policy of the federal act is identical whether the judgment is entered by a state or a federal court. Never before, I believe, has a federal right been allowed less protection in a state court than it is entitled to receive in the federal court.2

 The exclusive control which the United States has in the water power of a navigable stream (United States v. Chandler-Dunbar Co., 229 U. S. 53, 69; United States v. Appalachian Electric Co., 311 U. S. 377, 427-428) extends to the water power of a non-*376navigable stream where private command over it is inconsistent with the federal program of control over navigation. United States v. Willow River Co., 324 U. S. 499, 509. Federal regulation and control has the same effect in each case. Oklahoma v. Atkinson Co., 313 U. S. 508, 525.

While the equal protection clause does not require a legislature to achieve “abstract symmetry”1 or to classify *468with “mathematical nicety,” 2 that clause does require lawmakers to refrain from invidious distinctions of the sort drawn by the statute challenged in this case.3
The statute arbitrarily discriminates between male and female owners of liquor establishments. A male owner, although he himself is always absent from his bar, may employ his wife and daughter as barmaids. A female owner may neither work as a barmaid herself nor employ her daughter in that position, even if a man is always present in the establishment to keep order. This inevitable result of the classification belies the assumption that the statute was motivated by a legislative solicitude for the moral and physical well-being of women who, but for the law, would be employed as barmaids. Since there could be no other conceivable justification for such discrimination against women owners of liquor establishments, the statute should be held invalid as a denial of equal protection.

After considering the facts of the case, the court concludes that it is proper for the prosecution to cross-establish good character on the grounds that the defendant enjoys a reputation among his neighbors. It is also necessary for the defense to testify on behalf of the accused. A witness cannot testify about any specific acts or course of conduct or ""his possession of particular disposition"" or ""beniferous mental and moral trait,"" but can only give an opinion as to how well he has known the man.

This gives the court the opportunity to examine the character of the person being arrested.

Mr. Justice Frankfurter,
concurring.
Despite the fact that my feelings run in the general direction of the views expressed by Mr. Justice Rutledge in his dissent, I join the Court’s opinion. I do so because I believe it to be unprofitable, on balance, for appellate courts to formulate rigid rules for the exclusion of evidence in courts of law that outside them would not be regarded as clearly irrelevant in the determination of issues. For well-understood reasons this Court’s occasional ventures in formulating such rules hardly encourage confidence in denying to the federal trial courts a power of control over the allowable scope of cross-examination possessed by trial judges in practically all State courts. After all, such uniformity of rule in the conduct of trials is the crystallization of experience even when due allowance is made for the force of imitation. To reject such an impressive body of experience would imply a more dependable wisdom in a matter of this sort than I can claim.
To leave the District Courts of the United States the discretion given to them by this decision presupposes a *488high standard of professional competence, good sense, fairness and courage on the part of the federal district judges. If the United States District Courts are not manned by judges of such qualities, appellate review, no matter how stringent, can do very little to make up for the lack of them.

4288,9420248,104607,040dissent,"In this paper, the Court argues that there are three stages in the process of character evidence: 1) denys the prosecution the ability to attack the accused's reputation by proof of good general reputation; 2) permits the defendant to test his reputation by qualified witnesses; and 3) allows the prosecution to rebuke the defense for failing to show sufficient evidence of good character. The first stage denies the government the right to accuse the accused of bad conduct or ""specific derogatory incident"" connected with the one charged. The second stage allows the accused at his option to prove byqualified witnesses that a person has a good reputation or not Tarnished by illness-repute. Finally, the court understands the trial's latitude of questioning crossexamination when it comes to specific acts of crime. This is an important distinction from the hearsay rules which prohibit the government from showing bad public character on its own. For example, some criminals may be arrested because they have committed other crimes without having committed the same crime. If the case does not fall under these circumstances, the jury will still believe that the man was guilty beyond reasonable doubt. However, since cities are more generally urban than before, the courts do not want to allow the government to bring in evidence of bad character directly on the grounds that it would lead to a conviction of guilt. But even so, as long as the charges against the accused remain unchallenged, the prosecutor can use testimony about the defendant's good character to counteract the charge. Thus, the only way the prosecution can get rid of such evidence is to ask the witness who speaks to reputation whether he has heard anything about the offense. When the prosecution asks the name of Petitioner, however, the answer is no. Instead, the prosecution must tell the jury what could not be proved directly through the petitioner's testimony. Therefore, the entire question of knowledge concerning a prior past arrest is unnecessary.",1949-02-14,1.0

Reed defends the provision in the Act of 1916 that allows an interest in a transfer by trust to take effect during the donor's death. It has not been changed since then. A power of appointment and change is a sign of testamentary authority over the entire entity. If the donor dies before the transferor can dispose of the remainder of the estate, all the proceeds of the gift will be subject to the estate tax. However, Congress did not amend the section regarding the definition of ""possession or pleasure."" Instead, Congress added provisions providing for the use of life interests as long as they remain in the original grantor's estate.

4300,9420265,104616,040dissent,"In this paper, Justice Frankfurter dissents from the majority opinion that the case of Spiegel was not an attempt to evade the estate tax because it did not transfer any interest in property intended to take effect or after death. The court's reasoning is that if one could have a chance that settled property might return to his settlor and be subjected to the federal tax, then the entire trust asset must be included as part of the gross estate; otherwise, the entire wealth of the trust will be subject to taxes. If all three children die before the setter, the share goes to each child. If none of the children survives, the remainder goes to the other two children. If no of the setstlor's three children leave alive, the rest of the money goes to another child. This would mean that there would never again be a possibility that the fortune went back to Spiegel. However, the Court does not believe that such reversionary interests are relevant in tax cases since they do not involve feudal ideas about seission. It also does not matter whether the donor died without giving up his own children. Even if some of the beneficiaries were dead, the value of their inheritance would still be equal to the amount of the sum invested in the trust. Both cases deal with the issue of how the settor's interest should be measured. For example, when the trustee had reserved a large interest only by his dying, the law didn't make nice calculations on the chance that he would give himself to reclaim the property. That means that even if the future grandchildren don't inherit the entirety of the fund, the whole estate would go to them. Finally, the Supreme Court decides that Congress hasn't meant to treat a trust-captured in his lifetime as a tax obligation. Instead, Congress has asked the Court to interpret the provisions of the Act of 1931 for the purposes of reducing the tax burden on the decedent's life estate. Thus, Congress can't just pass a new section of the law saying that a ""trust settlement"" cannot be subjecting a living estate to the estate bill.

Third, the court believes that the 1932 amendments to the constitution did not make such a change.

Mr. Justice Rutledge,
dissenting.
I am in accord with the views expressed by my brother Black. I think it important, however, to point out that a majority here agree with him that the issue presented is whether a state (here a municipality) may forbid all use of sound trucks or amplifying devices in public streets, without reference to whether “loud and raucous noises” are emitted. Only a minority take the view that the Trenton ordinance merely forbids using amplifying instruments emitting loud and raucous noises.
*105Yet a different majority, one including that minority and two other justices, sustain the ordinance and its application. In effect Kovacs stands convicted, but of what it is impossible to tell, because the majority upholding the conviction do not agree upon what constituted the crime. How, on such a hashing of different views of the thing forbidden, Kovacs could have known with what he was charged or could have prepared a defense, I am unable to see. How anyone can do either in the future, under this decision, I am equally at loss to say.
In my view an ordinance drawn so ambiguously and inconsistently as to reflect the differing views of its meaning taken by the two groups who compose the majority sustaining it, would violate Fourteenth Amendment due process even if no question of free speech were involved. No man should be subject to punishment under a statute when even a bare majority of judges upholding the conviction cannot agree upon what acts the statute denounces.
What the effect of this decision may be I cannot foretell, except that Kovacs will stand convicted and the division among the majority voting to affirm leaves open for future determination whether absolute and total state prohibition of sound trucks in public places can stand consistently with the First Amendment. For myself, I have no doubt of state power to regulate their abuse in reasonable accommodation, by narrowly drawn statutes, to other interests concerned in use of the streets and in freedom from public nuisance. But that the First Amendment limited its protections of speech to the natural range of the human voice as it existed in 1790 would be, for me, like saying that the commerce power remains limited to navigation by sail and travel by the use of horses and oxen in accordance with the principal modes of carrying on commerce in 1789. The Constitution was not drawn with any such limited vision of time, space *106and mechanics. It is one thing to hold that the states may regulate the use of sound trucks by appropriately limited measures. It is entirely another to say their use can be forbidden altogether.
To what has been said above and by Mr. Justice Black, I would add only that I think my brother Frankfurter demonstrates the conclusion opposite to that which he draws, namely, that the First Amendment guaranties of the freedoms of speech, press, assembly and religion occupy preferred position not only in the Bill of Rights but also in the repeated decisions of this Court.

Mr. Justice Burton,
dissenting.
While I agree with the opinion of the Court that the hearsay testimony in question was not properly admissible, I regard its admission, under the circumstances of this case, as an absolutely harmless error.
In speaking of harmless errors that may result from the admission of evidence, this Court has said:
“Errors of this sort in criminal causes conceivably may be altogether harmless in the face' of other clear evidence, although the same error might turn scales otherwise level, as constantly appears in the application of the policy of § 269* to questions of the admission of cumulative evidence.” Kotteakos v. United States, 328 U. S. 750, 763.
*459Again, in determining whether error in the admission of evidence should result in a reversal of a judgment, we said that the question is—
“what effect the error had or reasonably may be taken to have had upon the jury’s decision. . . .
“If, when all is said and done, the conviction is sure that the error did not influence the jury, or had but very slight effect, the verdict and the judgment should stand, except perhaps where the departure is from a constitutional norm or a specific command of Congress.” Id. at pp. 764 — 765.
The issue before us involves no constitutional question or specific command of Congress. The trial was a long one concerning personal conduct involving simple issues of fact. The record of it covers more than 800 pages. The jury must have been thoroughly familiar with the issues and with the degree of dependability, if any, to be placed upon the oral testimony of the petitioner and of the two witnesses involved in the conversation that is before us as reported by one of them. The evidence supporting the jury’s verdict was cumulative, repetitive and corroborated to such a point that I cannot believe that the verdict or the rights of the parties could have been appreciably affected by such weight as the jury may have attached to this reported snatch of conversation between two people of such negligible dependability as was demonstrated here. After this extended fourth trial, to set ¿side this jury’s verdict merely because of this particular bit of hearsay testimony seems to me to be an unrealistic procedure that tends to make a travesty of the jury system which is neither necessary nor deserved. I would affirm the judgment below.

The Government conceded unreservedly that the correctness of this decision turns entirely on the facts of this particular case. We ought not to be called upon to canvass a record of 870 pages to determine whether the District Court properly viewed the facts in relation to the charge, or whether the appraisal made by the Court of Appeals was right. I do not propose to do so. One appellate review of the facts should suffice, even when the review goes against the Government.

  The question presented by this petition is whether the Court of Appeals followed our mandate on remand of the cause in 335 U. S. 355.
 

 
   *805
   
  The case when it was here earlier this Term appeared in the following posture:
 

  A condemnation proceeding was instituted by the United States under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (52 Stat. 1040, 1044, 21 U. S. C. § 334). Sixteen machines with alleged diagnostic and curative capabilities had been shipped in interstate commerce. Leaflets describing the uses of the machine had been shipped at a separate time. The Court of Appeals had held that the separate shipments of the machines and leaflets precluded a conclusion that the leaflets had accompanied the device in interstate commerce, and therefore the transaction was outside the reach of the Act. We reversed the Court of Appeals and held that the separate shipment of the machines and leaflets constituted a single interrelated activity.
 

  On remand the Court of Appeals concluded that because there were several shipments of machines and a single shipment of advertising matter, it was not clear which shipments might be considered a single interrelated activity. Therefore, it remanded the case to the District Court for a determination of this fact. 172 F. 2d 386.
 

  When the case was here before, we decided that the fact of separate shipments of machines and leaflets was immaterial. The controlling factors were whether the leaflets were designed for use with the machine and whether they were so used. Since the function of the leaflets and the purpose of their shipment were established, nothing more was needed to show that the movements of the machines and leaflets constituted a single interrelated activity. Moreover, the case is not complicated by shipments of machines and leaflets to different persons. One Kelsch was the recipient of both.
 

  On remand the Court of Appeals adhered to its former ruling that the District Court erroneously excluded evi
   
   *806
   
  dence as to the therapeutic or curative value of the machines. When the case was here before we did not disturb that ruling. But we did leave to the Court of Appeals for consideration a further question — whether the evidence as respects the falsity of the representations regarding the diagnostic capabilities of the machines was adequate to sustain the condemnation even though error in exclusion of the other evidence were conceded. The United States is entitled to a hearing on that question.
 

  The petition for certiorari is granted and the judgment is

It is decided that the facts presented in the initial complaint were sufficient to establish a charge as to negligence under the statute. This conclusion is supported by the fact that the Nebraska Supreme Court has consistently held that if a worker suffers injury while working, then the employer's negligence is attributable only to the particular kind of injury caused. Thus, even though Congress had intended to exclude occupational diseases from the compensation system, the legislature has nonetheless allowed workers' injuries to be covered under the Act.",1949-06-20,2.0
4388,9420327,104677,030concurrence,"
Mr. Justice Frankfurter,
concurring in part.
At the risk of wearisome reiteration it is relevant to say again that the common-law concept of negligence is ait antiquated and uncivilized basis for working out rights and duties for disabilities and deaths inevitably due to the conduct of modern industry. In the conscious or unconscious endeavor not to have the human cost of industry fall with cruel injustice upon workers and their families, the law of negligence gives rise to endless casuistry. So long as the gamble of an occasional heavy verdict is not replaced by the security of a modern system of .insurance, courts must continue to apply the notion of pegligence in situations for which it was never intended. Therefore,' if a claim is made that an injury is causally related to a carrier’s failure to maintain standards of care appropriate for employment on.a railroad, the Federal Employers’ Liability Act entitles an employee to establish that claim to a jury s satisfaction. Damages are re*197coverable under that Act for suffering “injury.” That term, it seems to me, is sufficiently broad to include bodily injury which nowadays is more specifically characterised as “occupational disease.” Accordingly, I agree that recovery may be had under the Federal Employers’ Liability Act for silicosis, where the facts, sustain such a claim, as is illustrated by the case of Sadowski v. Long Island R. Co., 292 N. Y. 448, 55 N. E. 2d 497.
On the other hand, I agree with the Missouri Supreme Court that occupational diseases cannot be fitted into the category of “accidents” for which the Boiler Inspection Act devised.a scheme of regulation and a basis of liability. 36 Stat. 913, as amended, 45 U. S. C. §§ 22-34. I ‘think I appreciate the humane impulse which seeks to bring occupational diseases within such a regime. But due regard for the limits of judicial interpretation precludes such free-handed application of. a statute to situations outside its language and its purpose. To do so, moreover, is, I believe, .a disservice to the humane ends which are sought to be promoted. Legislation is needed which will effectively meet the social obligations which underlie the incidence of occupational disease. See National Insurance (Industrial Injuries) Act, 1946, .9 & 10 Geo. 6, 488, particularly Part IY. The need for such legislation becomes obscured and the drive for it retarded if encouragement is given to the thought that there are now adequate remedies for occupational diseases in callings subject to Congressional control. The result of the present decision is to secure for this petitioner the' judgment which the jury awarded him. It does not secure a proper system for dealing with occupational diseases.
I would reverse this judgment and remand the case to the Supreme Court of Missouri for proceedings consistent with this opinion.

Mr. Justice Murphy,
dissenting.
A combination of factors in this case impels me to dissent.'
Petitioner was convicted of murder by a jury, and sentenced to death by the judge. The jury which heard the *253trial unanimously recommended life imprisonment as a suitable punishment for the defendant. They had observed him throughout the trial, had heard all the evidence adduced against him, and in spite of the shocking character of the crime of which they found him guilty, were unwilling to decree that his life should be taken. In our criminal courts the jury sits as the representative of the community; its voice is that of the society against which the crime was committed. A judge, even though vested with statutory authority to do so, should hesitate indeed to increase the sé verity of such a community expression.
He should be willing to increase it, moreover, only with the most scrupulous regard for the rights of the defendant. The record before us indicates that the judge exercised his discretion to deprive a man of his life, in reliance on material madp available to him in a probation report, consisting almost entirely of évidence that would have been inadmissible at the trial. Some, such ás allegations of prior crimes, was irrelevant. Much was incompetent as hearsay. All was damaging, and none was subject to scrutiny by the defendant.
Due process of law includes at least the idea that a person accused of crime shall be accorded a fair hearing through all the stages of the proceedings against him. I agree with the Court t.s to the value and humaneness of liberal use of probation reports as developed by modern penologists, but, in a capital case, against the unanimous recommendation of a jury,- where the report would concededly not have been admissible at the trial, and was not subject to examination by the defendant, I am forced to conclude that the high commands of due process were not obeyed.

It also determines that the effects of such contracts may be lessening competition or tending to create dominated competition. These cases involve three different types of requirements contracts: 1) where the lessee agrees to use only one product; 2) where the manufacturer does not own patent on the product; and 3) where the buyer has no control over the supply of products used by the manufacturer. This case supports the argument that the effect will be lessened as long as the conditions are satisfied. However, the courts argue that there must be some sort of evidence showing that competition flourished during the period when the contracts were in effect.

It also decides that the question about whether or no title passes must be answered before the lawsuit can go forward. If the plaintiff claims that the war asset administration has an interest in the coal, then the fact that the officer acts as an instrument of the sovereign doesn't allow the court to take jurisdiction over his actions. But if the officers are involved in specific relief, they may be able to seek relief from the sovereign without asking for payment of damages. A second category of cases arises where the government official takes or holds property which the plaintiff asserts is ""illegal"" under general law. This means that the owner of the property cannot be accused of taking or holding the property legally. Therefore, the only action taken by the government office issuing a demand for relief.

Both in the employments which the Fair Labor Standards Act covers and in the exemptions it makes, the Congress has cast upon the courts the duty of making distinctions that often are bound to be so nice as to appear arbitrary in relation to each other. A specific situation, like that presented in this case, presents a problem for construction which may with nearly equal reason be resolved one way rather than another. Except when a conflict between Courts of Appeals requires settlement by this Court, it does not seem to me very profitable to bring the individual cases here for adjudication. But since this case is here it has to be decided. The nature of the problem being what it is, I acquiesce in the judgment that commends itself to the majority of my brethren.

It also means that even if some rights do not seem to fit into the definition of ""primitive"" or ""basic"" rights, they can still be protected from police intrusion.

In this case petitioner was convicted of a crime in a state court on evidence obtained by a search and seizure conducted in a manner that this Court has held “unreasonable” and therefore in violation of the Fourth Amendment. And under a rule of evidence adopted by this Court evidence so obtained by federal officers cannot be used against defendants in federal courts. For reasons stated in my dissenting opinion in Adamson v. California, 332 U. S. 46, 68, I agree with the conclusion of the Court that the Fourth Amendment’s prohibition of “unreasonable searches and seizures” is enforceable against the states. Consequently, I should be for reversal of this case if I thought the Fourth Amendment not only prohibited “unreasonable searches and seizures,” but also, of itself, barred the use of evidence so unlawfully obtained. But I agree with what appears to be a plain implication of the Court’s opinion that the federal exclusionary rule is *40not a command of the Fourth Amendment but is a judicially created rule of evidence which Congress might negate. See McNabb v. United States, 318 U. S. 332. This leads me to concur in the Court’s judgment of affirmance.
It is not amiss to repeat my belief that the Fourteenth Amendment was intended to make the Fourth Amendment in its entirety applicable to the states. The Fourth Amendment was designed to protect people against unrestrained searches and seizures by sheriffs, policemen and other law enforcement officers. Such protection is an essential in a free society. And I am unable to agree that the protection of people from over-zealous or ruthless state officers is any less essential in a country of “ordered liberty” than is the protection of people from over-zealous or ruthless federal officers. Certainly there are far more state than federal enforcement officers and their activities, up to now, have more frequently and closely touched the intimate daily lives of people than have the activities of federal officers. A state officer’s “knock at the door . . . as a prelude to a search, without authority of law,” may be, as our experience shows, just as ominous to “ordered liberty” as though the knock were made by a federal officer.

It does not offer any alternative to these three options. If we were expecting a district attorney to try to prosecute someone for violations of the searched and seizere clause during an errand ordered by the district attorney, then it would be difficult for him to do so. There is also a third option: a ""trespass"" action for damages.

The court does not consider issues of fact which are directly related to the actual crime, but only those elements which are unquestioned and do not implicate the accused's constitutional rights. This is important because state courts have been adjudicating on cases involving ""due process"" since the time of the Federalist Papers. However, there has been some disagreement among the courts about what constitutes due process; for example, many states have found that statements made by a criminal are sufficient evidence against an accused when they are confronted with such facts. Therefore, the question of whether or not a statement was actually voluntary is one of the most important issues to discuss. On December 12, 1947, Watts was arrested at the scene of an attempted murder. He was taken from the county prison to State Police headquarters and interrogated several days later. When Watts finally confessed, however, the charges were denied. After two days in isolation in a jail cell called the ""hole,"" Watts had no opportunity to answer any further questions. Although the laws of the state require that petitioner receive a prompt initial hearing before he is tried, Petitioner was kept in confinement for the first three days without assistance or professional advice. Disrespect of ruddermentary needsof life -- opportunities for sleep nor food -- are also relevant. Because the law requires that petitioners be given judicial protection during interrogation so that he can make a decision regarding his right to free choice, the charge cannot be relied upon.

The undisputed facts surrounding the arrest and confession of the petitioner in this case are as follows:
Petitioner was arrested June 3, 1946, on suspicion of committing a homicide about six months after the crime *67had been committed. At the time of his arrest he was not taken before a committing magistrate, as required by Pennsylvania law. He was held five days before being lawfully committed to custody. During this confinement he did not have the aid of family, friends, or counsel. He was not informed of his constitutional rights at the outset of his detention.
During this confinement petitioner was subject to continual interrogations by a number of police officers, who questioned him individually and in small groups. The day of his arrest he was questioned about three hours in the afternoon and again in the evening. The next two days he was questioned three to four hours in the afternoon. The next day the questioning was intensified and he was again subjected to both day and evening sessions. On the 7th of June, the day he finally confessed, the interrogations were intensive, once again being held afternoon and evening. Petitioner denied his guilt, even after being informed that other suspects had issued statements incriminating him. About eleven o’clock in the evening, after three hours of interrogation, petitioner finally indicated that he wished to make a statement. This confession was set down on paper the next day, and petitioner signed it after he had been committed by a magistrate.
These interrogations had been conducted by at least seven different officers. They were conducted in petitioner’s cell, in a small office, and in a room which had a stand-up screen where suspects were put for identification. It was admitted that the reason petitioner was not brought before a magistrate was because he had not given the answers which the police wanted and which they believed he could give.
The case is but another vivid illustration of the use of illegal detentions to exact confessions. It is governed by Watts v. Indiana, ante, p. 49, decided this day.

Petitioner’s flight from the country after the grant of his petition for writ of certiorari and after the submission of his cause on the merits necessitates a decision as to the disposition now to be made of this case. Since the petitioner by his own volition may have rendered moot any judgment on the merits, we must, as a matter of our own practice, decide whether the submission should be set aside and the writ of certiorari dismissed or whether we should postpone review indefinitely by ordering the case removed from the docket, pending the return of the fugitive.
Our practice, however, has been to order such cases to be removed from the docket. Smith v. United States, 94 U. S. 97; Bonahan v. Nebraska, 125 U. S. 692. We adhere to those precedents. Accordingly after this term the cause will be left off the docket until a direction to the contrary shall issue.

Mr. Justice Murphy,
dissenting.
The petitioner is an alien, a Communist, and a fugitive from justice. He was convicted of willful default before a Committee of Congress. We decided to hear this case after determining that the issues he presented were of importance. We heard argument, read briefs, and all but made the announcement of our decision.
Then the petitioner left the country. Efforts at extradition in Great Britain were unsuccessful. The petitioner is now beyond the territorial jurisdiction of this Court. It is argued that we are therefore without jurisdiction in the case.
*194We can decide only cases or controversies. A moot case is not a “case” within the meaning of Art. III. United States v. Evans, 213 U. S. 297. But a moot case is one in which the particular controversy confronting the Court has ended. That is not true when a prisoner has simply escaped. We are not at liberty to assume that all escaped defendants will never return to the jurisdiction. And the importance of a criminal judgment is not limited to the imprisonment of the defendant. Thus an alien convicted of crime is excluded from admission to the United States, 8 U. S. C. § 136 (e).
Since the question is one of jurisdiction, the unlikelihood of prejudice to this petitioner is irrelevant. Equally irrelevant on the question of mootness is President Washington’s request for an advisory opinion. That the case may become moot if a defendant does not return does not distinguish it from any other case we decide. For subsequent events may render any decision nugatory. The petitioner having subjected himself to our jurisdiction by filing a petition for review, he cannot now revoke or nullify it and thus prevent an adjudication of the questions at issue merely by leaving the country and repudiating its authority. Thus I entirely agree with those of my brethren who believe we have jurisdiction.
But the Court adopts another alternative. It exercises its discretion and refuses to decide the issue. It is clear, however, as Mr. Justice Jackson points out, that it is the importance of the legal issues, not the parties, which bring the case to this Court. Those issues did not leave when Eisler did. They remain here for decision; they are of the utmost importance to the profession and to the public.
Law is at its loftiest when it examines claimed injustice even at the instance of one to whom the public is bitterly hostile. We should be loath to shirk our obligations, whatever the creed of the particular petitioner. Our *195country takes pride in requiring of its institutions the examination and correction of alleged injustice whenever it occurs. We should not permit an affront of this sort to distract us from the performance of our constitutional duties.
I dissent.

Mr. Justice Jackson,
dissenting.
I cannot agree that a decision of Eisler’s case should be indefinitely deferred, awaiting what I do not know. The case is fully submitted and all that remains is for members of the Court to hand down their opinions and the decision. Eisler’s presence for that would be neither necessary nor usual. The case has reached this stage at considerable detriment to the country, since this Court’s grant of his petition for review was what delayed Eisler’s commencement of sentence and afforded him opportunity to escape. If ever there were good reasons to grant him a review, they are equally good reasons for now deciding its issues.
The Rules of this Court provide that we shall grant a petition for review here only where there are “special and important reasons therefor.” They limit such cases to those that present “a question of general importance . . . which has not been, but should be, settled by this court.” Rule 38. (Emphasis supplied.)
Under our practice, the grant of Eisler’s petition meant that four Justices of this Court, at least, were in agreement that the questions he raised were of this description. If they were then, they are still. His petition challenged the power of Congress and its investigating committees to hold, and to control the procedures of, investigations of this nature. These questions are recurring ones, certain to be repeated, for the grant of a review has cast doubt not only on the validity of Eisler’s conviction but upon congressional procedures as well. *196No one can know what the law is until this case is decided or until someone can carry a like case through the two lower courts again to get the question here.
Decision at this time is not urged as a favor to Eisler. If only his interests were involved, they might well be forfeited by his flight. But it is due to Congress and to future witnesses before its committees that we hand down a final decision. I therefore dissent from an expedient that lends added credence to Eisler’s petition, which I think is without legal merit. I do not think we can run away from the case just because Eisler has.
I should not want to be understood as approving the use that the Committee on Un-American Activities has frequently made of its power. But I think it would be an unwarranted act of judicial usurpation to strip Congress of its investigatory power, or to assume for the courts the function of supervising congressional committees. I should affirm the judgment below and leave the responsibility for the behavior of its committees squarely on the shoulders of Congress.1

 What the Congress can with safety do, after this Court’s decision in Christoffel v. United States, ante, p. 84, seems to present a good question.

Mr. Justice Burton,
concurring.
I concur on the ground that the clause in the 8th Article of War, which deals with the availability of an officer of the Judge Advocate General’s Department and is here at issue, is purely directory, and not jurisdictional. The 8th Article, in any event, calls for the appointment as the law member of a general court-martial of an officer meeting certain specifications. He must be either an officer of the Judge Advocate General’s Department or he must be selected by the appointing authority as specially qualified for his duties. The unavailability of an officer of the Judge Advocate General’s Department merely opens the field of eligibility to other branches of the service.
It may be assumed that, when the general court-martial involved in this case was appointed, it was a jurisdictional requirement that there be a law member appointed to it. It also may be assumed that it was a jurisdictional *112requirement that, if the appointing authority determined that no officer of the Judge Advocate General’s Department was then “available for the purpose,” such authority was restricted to the appointment of “an officer of some other branch of the service selected by [him] . . . as specially qualified to perform the duties of law member.” (Emphasis supplied.) If the officer who was appointed met neither requirement, it may be assumed that the court-martial would have been without jurisdiction. If, however, as in this case, it is not questioned that the law member met the second requirement, I believe that we should not permit a review here of the discretion used by the appointing authority in determining the preliminary administrative question of whether or not an officer of the Judge Advocate General’s Department was “available for the purpose.” We should not permit it, even if it is alleged that the appointing authority’s discretion in this regard was grossly abused. That detail was a matter within his administrative responsibility and should not be available as a basis for collateral attack upon the jurisdiction of an otherwise qualified and competent general court-martial.

If real estate brokerage is to be distinguished from the professions or from other labor that is permitted to organize, the Court does not impart any standards for so doing.
It is certain that those rendering many kinds of service are allowed to combine and fix uniform rates of pay and conditions of service. This is true of all laborers, who may do so within or without unions and whose unions frequently do include owners of establishments that employ others, such as automobile sales agencies. See, for example, International Brotherhood of Teamsters, etc. v. Hanke, ante, p. 470. I suppose this immunity is not confined to those whose labor is manual, and is not lost because the labor performed is professional. The brokerage which is swept under the antitrust laws by this decision is perhaps a borderline activity. However, the broker furnishes no goods and performs only personal services. Capital assets play no greater part in his service than in that of the lawyer, doctor or office worker. Services of the real estate broker, if not strictly fiduciary, are at least those of a trusted agent and, oftentimes, advisory as to values and procedures. I am not persuaded that fixing uniform fees for the broker’s labor is more offensive to the antitrust laws than fixing uniform fees for the labor of a lawyer, a doctor, a carpenter, or a plumber.

While I agree with the Court as to the constitutional and statutory issues canvassed in its opinion, I am unable *603to answer Mr. Justice Jackson’s dissent, and I must therefore yield to it.
Of course Congress may constitutionally vest judicially unreviewable discretion in an executive agency to initiate multiple suits in order to stop trafficking in pernicious drugs or even in those that are harmless, where efficacy is misrepresented. I agree that it has done so in the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938. 52 Stat. 1040, 21 U. S. C. § 301 et seq. But it does not at all follow that Congress has thereby cut off the right of access to the courts to prove that the enforcing agency has not acted within the broadest bounds of fair discretion, rare as the occasion may be for such an attempt and however improbable its success.
Such I understand to be the nature of the proceedings below and such the basis of the District Court’s decree. Unless we can say, as I cannot, that the findings in support of it have no support in the evidence, we should not hold that the court below was without jurisdiction to entertain the suit.
The limited claim which the District Court sustained falls precisely within the qualification left open by this Court in a leading case sustaining the power of Congress to vest unreviewable discretion in executive agencies. When the Court was urged to deny this power of Congress and “extreme cases” were put showing “how reckless and arbitrary might be the action of Executive officers,” the Court made this answer:
“It will be time enough to deal with such cases as and when they arise. Suffice it to say, that the courts have rarely, if ever; felt themselves so restrained by technical rules that they could not find some remedy, consistent with the law, for acts, whether done by government or by individual persons, that violated natural justice or were hostile to the fundamental *604principles devised for the protection of the essential rights of property.” Monongahela Bridge Co. v.

The Court does not deal at all with what appears to be the ultimate issue decided by the court below.
The trial court of three judges wrote no opinion but made forty-three detailed findings of fact which would require twenty of these printed pages to reproduce and which summarize a 1,500-page record of a long trial. Those findings are made largely on undisputed evidence and on evidence from government sources. This Court does not criticize or reverse any of them.
The substance of these is to find that the Government instituted a multiplicity of court actions, with seizures in widely separated parts of the country, with a purpose to harass appellee and its dealers and intending that these actions and the attendant publicity would injure appellee’s business before any of the issues in such cases could be tried. This, the court held, was justified by no emergency, the product being, at worst, harmless and having been marketed for years with knowledge of the Department.
Assuming as I do that the Act on its face is not constitutionally defective, the question remains whether it has been so misused by refusal of administrative hearing, together with such irreparable injury in anticipation of judicial hearing, as to deny appellee due process of law' or to amount to an abuse of process of the courts.
The Government has sought and received from this Court protection against a multiplicity of suits under *605circumstances where injury was less apparent than in this. Landis v. North American Co., 299 U. S. 248. The holding of the court below and the contention of the appellee here that the Government is not entitled to so apply the statute as to bring multiple actions designed to destroy a business before it can be heard in its own defense is not frivolous, to say the least.
I am constrained to withhold assent to a decision that passes in silence what I think presents a serious issue.

An individual purchased certain American telephone and telegraph company bonds at a fixed price in excess of $163. The bond was calledable before maturity on the basis of a schedule coming into effect. Respondent claimed an amortization deduction for the difference between the purchase price and the actual price of the bond. The commissioner of internal revenue refused to allow such a deduction because it did not include the premium paid for conversion privilege. However, the court disagreed with the Commissioner's interpretation of the statute. It had been recommended that the interest on any bond be adjusted so as to reduce the amount of debt premium allowed by the tax law. Congress included these provisions in the Act of 1942.

However, it also provides for services by registered mail outside the state where such services are not available. The highest court in Virginia rejects this provision as violated due process and dismisses the case on appeal.

It does not pay its treasurer and only sends blank applications to new members who have no paid agents. The Association receives notice by mail but refuses to respond to further inquiries about its status. The Court decides that the association cannot be allowed to conduct business in Nebraska without first having submitted to the state's regulatory authority. In contrast, Minnesotans claim that their contracts do not involve doing business in Montana because they are not engaged in business there.

The court dismisses the petition on the grounds that it is not entitled to the right to seek habeas corpsus from any official who has violated the Constitution or its laws. The Supreme Court's opinion is that there is no need for federal courts to issue the wit of habeasco corpus on behalf of foreign enemies. However, because Congress has granted powers to the president to exercise diplomatic power over foreigners, the government does not want to interfere with the ability of the American people to assert their rights under the Articles of Confederation. This means that aliens may be subject to arrest, interrogation, deportation, and other forms of imprisonment. These charges do not constitute ""an incident of war"" but rather ""an event of alienage.""

Reg. 1400; 8832, 6 Fed. Reg. 3715.

  Those opposed to the judgments urge that, as a matter of federal law, the freezing order prevented the creation of any claim recognizable under § 606 of the New York Banking Law.
 

  Oral argument and study of the record have convinced us that the judgments of the New York Court of Appeals are not inconsistent with the First War Powers Act of 1941, § 301, 55 Stat. 839, or the above Executive Orders. We accept the New York court’s determination that under New York law these claims arose from transactions in New York and were entitled to a preference.

Mr. Justice Douglas,
dissenting.
I agree that the differentials established under § 307 (d) of the Act need not be measured by the difference in cost between rail and barge transportation. Barge costs as compared with rail costs are, however, a relevant factor for consideration by the Commission under § 307 (f)* when it determines what differentials are reasonable. *230When the Commission proceeds to fix differentials without knowing what the relative barge and rail costs are, it is to my mind experimenting as a legislative body might do, not performing the infinitely more exacting task of the rate expert.
The Commission practically concedes that in this case it adopts a different standard than the statutory one. It is admitted that on this record there can be no adequate findings on costs. The evidence for an earlier period (1933-1938) shows that the cost for joint rail-barge routing is greater than for direct all-rail routing. The Commission refused to pursue the cost study into later years. The reason is apparent. One of the appellees is Inland Waterways Corp. which operates Federal Barge Lines. Inland is a federal corporation (43 Stat. 360, 49 U. S. C. § 151) and it and Federal are subsidized by Congress. It is that program that the Commission is seeking to promote here. That may be important and desirable. But the standards which guide the Commission are still found in §307 (f). Costs have some relevance to the problem of differentials as § 307 (f) makes clear. Congress is entitled to disregard costs completely. But I do not think the Commission is.

The reason here is protection of marital confidence, not merely of communication between spouses. It seems to me clear that all that is shown here is communication. The circumstances of confidence are absent; what all may know is certainly not confidential.
For refusal to divulge his wife’s whereabouts, petitioner was in contempt. Since the sentence he received was such as he might have received for that single act of contempt, his conviction is valid. Cf. Pinkerton v. United States, 328 U. S. 640, 641, n. 1; Hirabayashi v. United States, 320 U. S. 81, 85. If petitioner conceived his sentence to be illegal, he would not be without remedy, for he might seek a reduction thereof on remand of this case under Rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. I intimate nothing as to that issue.
I would affirm the conviction.

One section makes it unlawful for anyone to sell or offer for sale in the city unless it is pasteurized, and the other prohibits the importation/receipt or storage of any milk for sale within the city. The court dismisses the appeal on the ground that both provisions violate the Constitution and federal law. Madison is the largest dairy market in Dane County with over 600 dairy farms and more than 10 times the required amount of milk per year. It has an annual milk production of about 500 thousand pounds and uses only three of its five-mile plants to inspect these farms. Madison contends that the Chicago milk ordinance is more stringent than the Madison one; however, Madison does not deny the appellant a permit to sell its product outside the city because its plant is more than five Miles away. Madison asserts that Congress has approved the local regulation of milk but that the issue concerns interstate commerce since there are no national regulations by the Congress.

The state law does not deal with the issue of local strikes because it is not subject to federal control. However, there are several cases in which courts have found no right to strike under the federal law; these cases do not conflict with the Madison law. For example, one company furnishes gas to the public in the city and county of Milwaukee but provides bus and Streetcar transportation in another area. Both companies give utility services only within the state but have been struck subject to the Taft-hartley act because their activities ""affect Commerce."" This statute has been used to prevent halts in service by some two utility companies as well as other companies outside the state. These companies have been found entitled to use the tact-hardtley legislation because they operate ""affected commerce."" They have also been found subject for such acts because their activity ""adfect commerce."" It is clear at the outset that Congress did not wish any part of the state's system of regulation to interfere with the federal laws. Therefore, the Court must decide whether the state law conflicts with the national law. First, we find that the rights to strike are protected under section 7 of the Wauthering Heights Act. Section 13 states that nothing in the Act shall be interpreted so as either: ""to interfere with or alter or diminuin any way the Right to Strike, or to affected the limitations or qualification on that Right."" Other cases reject an invitation to settle union disputes on the basis of absolute right to striking. Finally, Chapter 111.53 of the wauthling act prohibits the employer from making an awards that would inflict upon the rightof the employer to manager his business. If the contract fails, the arbitrator cannot make an award against the employer. Article 105 makes it illegal for anyone to lock out employees if they go out on work without consent. A group of public utility employees may call a protest or go out onto strike or cause interruption of essential services. Such action may be entjoined into an action instituteded by the state board.

Mr. Justice Reed,
dissenting in part.
Mr. Justice Reed concurs with the Court’s opinion and judgment except as it permits Illinois to use as a base for the tax computation petitioner’s sales, consummated in Massachusetts by the acceptance of orders forwarded to petitioner there by its Illinois branch office, filled in Massachusetts, and shipped from Massachusetts directly, and not by transhipment through the Illinois branch, to the buyer. In those sales title passes to buyer in Massachusetts. Illinois concedes in its brief the above facts as to this class of sales. From those facts I conclude that, nothing else appearing, the shipment was at the buyer’s cost and risk.
The Illinois statute recognizes that interstate business is not to be taxed. The transactions described above are interstate business.
*540The pull to permit each state to measure its tax by gross receipts from all sales with some slight relation to the taxing state is strong. The Constitution, however, puts the regulation of interstate commerce in the hands of the Federal Government. We have gone far in interpretation of the Constitution to allow a state to collect tax money, but in view of the delegation to the Federal Government of the power over commerce carried on in more than one state, we should preserve interstate commerce itself from taxes levied on it directly or on the unapportioned gross receipts of that commerce. Greyhound Lines v. Mealey, 334 U. S. 653; Joseph v. Carter & Weekes Stevedoring Co., 330 U. S. 422; Interstate Pipe Line Co. v. Stone, dissent, 337 U. S. 662, 676.
Our closest approach to the tax on the above interstate business was the tax on DuGrenier, Inc., in McGoldrick v. Felt & Tarrant Mfg. Co., 309 U. S. 70, 77. Despite marked differences between the DuGrenier transactions and all others considered in McGoldrick v. Berwind-White Co., 309 U. S. 33, without analysis of the effect of those differences and in reliance upon the fact that “possession” was transferred in New York from the transportation company to the buyer, we upheld the tax. If by the language used it was meant to say that the seller delivered the goods to the buyer, the transactions were, as we said, “controlled” by Berwind-White.
A few years later, however, in McLeod v. Dilworth Co., 322 U. S. 327, an opinion in which the writer of the DuGrenier opinion, Chief Justice Stone, joined, we made it clear that a tax cannot be collected by the buyer’s state on orders solicited in one state, accepted in another, and shipped at the purchaser’s risk. That later clarifying holding seems to me to state the true rule applicable here. I can see no difference, constitutionally, between solicitation by salesmen in a branch office or on the road. Such sales, consummated by direct shipment to Illinois buyers *541from out of the state are interstate business and free of the tax Illinois has levied. So far as the Supreme Court of Illinois holds those transactions taxable, it should be reversed.

Me. Justice Clark,
dissenting in part.
I believe the respondent reasonably attributed all of the proceeds of petitioner’s sales in Illinois to the company’s local activities. I therefore agree with the Illinois Supreme Court that under the circumstances shipments sent directly to Illinois customers on orders sent directly to Worcester were subject to the tax.
As the Court points out, petitioner can avoid taxation on its direct sales only ""by showing that . . . [they] are dissociated from the local business and [are] interstate in nature. The general rule, applicable here, is that a taxpayer claiming immunity from a tax has the burden of establishing his exemption.” Petitioner has failed to meet this burden. In fact Illinois has shown that petitioner’s Chicago office is its only source of customer relationship in Illinois; that the Chicago office provides the sole means through which petitioner can be reached with process by Illinois courts in the event a customer is aggrieved; that the local office affords service to machines after sale, as well as replacement of machines which are defective; that it stands ready to receive complaints and to offer engineering and technical advice; and that these multitudinous activities give to petitioner a local character which is most helpful in all its Illinois operations. Surely the Court’s conclusion, that “Petitioner has not established that such services as were rendered by the Chicago office were not decisive factors in establishing and holding this market,” applies with equal validity to the direct sales.
In maintaining a local establishment of such magnitude, petitioner has adopted the label of a home-town merchant. *542After it has received the manifold advantages of that label, we should not give our sanction to its claim made at taxpaying time that with respect to direct sales it is only an itinerant drummer. For the foregoing and other reasons which need not be stated, I would affirm in its entirety the judgment below.

The result reached by the Court may be sound by legislative standards. But the legal standards which govern us make the process of reaching that result tortuous to say the least.

  In this case the respondent Reggie Hammerstein, by her mother and guardian, commenced a paternity action against the petitioner in the Superior Court of California. Petitioner entered a special appearance in that court, alleging that it had no personal jurisdiction over him, as he was a New York resident. He moved to quash the service upon him in New York on the grounds that any judgment obtained against him in this proceeding would deprive him of due process. The motion to quash was denied. The superior court entered judgment for the respondent.
 

  Prior to the entry of the judgment, petitioner filed a petition for a writ of prohibition in the District Court of Appeal. This petition was denied without opinion. The California Supreme Court denied his application for

  We have examined the Act, its legislative history and related statutory provisions and have considered the various inferences drawn from the legislative materials by counsel. The short of the matter is that Congress has not expressed itself in regard to the question before us. In resolving the conflict of decisions, we must determine whether the word “brother,” as used in this federal statute, restricts the policyholder’s choice of beneficiaries to brothers of the blood. We are persuaded by the policy against drawing such a distinction in the family relationship.

I agree that there was a “taking” of the mining property from May 1 to October 12, 1943, but I find no *122ground for allowing the respondent to recover the sum here sought as compensation for such taking.
This case is within the principle stated in Marion & R. V. R. Co. v. United States, 270 U. S. 280, 282, as follows: “[E]ven if there was technically a taking, the judgment for defendant was right. Nothing was recoverable as just compensation, because nothing of value was taken from the company; and it was not subjected by the Government to pecuniary loss. Nominal damages are not recoverable in the Court of Claims.”
Here there is no showing by the company of any rental value due it as compensation for the Government's possession of its properties. There is no showing that anything of compensable value was taken by the Government from the company, or that the Government subjected the company to any pecuniary loss. The dissenting judge in the Court of Claims pointed out that—
“This extra expense consisted of an increased vacation allowance to the plaintiff’s workmen, and the refund to them of occupational charges like rentals on mine lamps. The court has not found that the plaintiff [company] could have operated its mine without making the concessions directed by the War Labor Board, nor has it found what the losses to the plaintiff would have been if the Government had not intervened and the strike had continued. I think that the court is not justified in awarding the plaintiff the amount of these expenditures when it does not and, I think, could not, find that the plaintiff was, in fact, financially harmed by the Government’s acts.” 115 Ct. Cl. at 678-679, 88 F. Supp. at 431.
Accordingly, I would reverse the judgment of the Court of Claims and allow no recovery by the respondent.

One of these orders states that all federal employees must be treated with equal protection. This means that only those who are members of the military can be excluded from membership.

Mr. Justice Douglas,

The term “common carrier” has but one meaning in the Act — the meaning given it by § 1. That definition was held in Champlin Refining Co. v. United States, 329 *302U. S. 29, sufficiently broad to include appellee. Section 19a was involved there and § 6 is involved here. That may make a constitutional difference; but there can be none so far as the statute is concerned. Since § 6, like § 19a, can reach appellee only through § 1, if § 1 is broad enough for the one section it is broad enough for the other. As the Court in its several decisions has not been consistent in its interpretation of the scope of the Act as applied to private pipe lines, I feel free to follow the precedent of the Pipe Line Cases, 234 U. S. 548, 561-562, and the view expressed in the dissent in Champlin Refining Co. v. United States, 329 U. S. 29, that pipe lines carrying only the commodities of their owners from the owners’ refineries to the owners’ storage tanks for marketing have not been made by Congress subject to the Act. Consequently, I agree that § 1 is not broad enough to bring appellee under the regulatory power of the Interstate Commerce Commission. Therefore, neither § 6 nor § 20 applies.

However, the court does not believe that Congress can force such a company to do so. Instead, the majority thinks that the section applies only to companies who have refused to deal with their independent producers or achieved ""monopoly status."" In other words, the law doesn't apply to any pipe line company without having been forced to act as a private carrier for hire. It also makes it clear that the passage was passed by Senator Lodge in 1906. The lodge amendment would make all pipe lines subject to regulation under the Articles of Confederation. This meant that every pipe line Company could be considered and hold to be common Carriers within the definition and purpose of the chapter.

  One of the jurisdictional questions raised by this caséis whether a court of three judges is required by Section 2282 in a suit to enjoin enforcement of congressional enactments affecting only the District of Columbia. The Section uses the words “any Act of Congress.” As against petitioners’ contention that all legislation passed by Congress is embraced-within that language, it is urged that a proper interpretation of Section 2282 confines the phrase “Act of Congress” to laws having general application throughout the United States. Resolution of this' issue determines whether this Court has exclusive appellate jurisdiction in this class of case,

I agree with the Court’s judgment and with its opinion insofar as it rests upon the language of the Miller-Tydings Act. But it does not appear that there is either necessity or propriety in going back of it into legislative history.
Resort to legislative history is only justified where the face of the Act is inescapably ambiguous, and then I think we should not go beyond Committee reports, which presumably are well considered and carefully prepared. *396I cannot deny that I have sometimes offended against that rule. But to select casual statements from floor debates, not always distinguished for candor or accuracy, as a basis for making up our minds what law Congress intended to enact is to substitute ourselves for the Congress in one of its important functions. The Rules of the House and Senate, with the sanction of the Constitution, require three readings of an Act in each House before final enactment. That is intended, I take it, to make sure that each House knows what it is passing and passes what it wants, and that what is enacted was formally reduced to writing. It is the business of Congress to sum up its own debates in its legislation. Moreover, it is only the words of the bill that have presidential approval, where that approval is given. It is not to be supposed that, in signing a bill, the President endorses the whole Congressional Record. For us to undertake to reconstruct an enactment from legislative history is merely to involve the Court in political controversies which are quite proper in the enactment of a bill but should have no place in its interpretation.
Moreover, there are practical reasons why we should accept whenever possible the meaning which an enactment reveals on its face. Laws are intended for all of our people to live by; and the people go to law offices to learn what their rights under those laws are. Here is a controversy which affects every little merchant in many States. Aside from a few offices in the larger cities, the materials of legislative history are not available to the lawyer who can afford neither the cost of acquisition, the cost of housing, or the cost of repeatedly examining the whole congressional history. Moreover, if he could, he would not know any way of anticipating what would impress enough members of the Court to be controlling. To accept legislative debates to modify statutory provi*397sions is to make the law inaccessible to a large part of the country.
By and large, I think our function was well stated by Mr. Justice Holmes: “We do not inquire what the legislature meant; we ask only what the statute means.” Holmes, Collected Legal Papers, 207. See also Soon Hing v. Crowley, 113 U. S. 703, 710-711. And I can think of no better example of legislative history that is unedifying and unilluminating than that of the Act before us.

The foundation of this power is usually conveyed by the concept of situs. As to this ground of decision I must dissent. In Connecticut Life Ins. Co. v. Moore, 333 U. S. 541, this Court sustained a New York statute allowing escheat of the unclaimed proceeds of insurance policies on the basis of the insured’s residence in the State at the time of the delivery of the policy. On that basis, the State where the last known owner was domiciled certainly has a better claim to abandoned stock than a State in which it happens that the corporation is subject to process.
If perchance one is to infer from the opinion that the unclaimed dividends deposited with the Guaranty Trust Company of New York are also escheatable by New York and that New York, had she anticipated New Jersey, could have exhausted all the potentialities of escheat in the unclaimed dividends, there is an added reason for dissent. The Constitution ought not to be placed in an unseemly light by suggesting that the constitutional rights of the several States depend on, and are terminated by, a race of diligence. The Bankruptcy Act expresses appropriate condemnation of such unseemly conduct and accidental solution of competing interests. It is one thing for a State to take custody of abandoned property as trustee, leaving open for subsequent determination what State has a controlling interest justifying escheat. But if a State wishes to assert its right to escheat property, which by its very nature is not exclusively within its control, other interested States should be parties to the litigation. The right to resort to this Court for adjust*445ment of conflicting interests among several States has been placed in the Constitution to avoid crude remedies of self-help in the settlement of interstate controversies. See Texas v. Florida, 306 U. S. 398.

Mr. Justice Douglas,
with whom Mr. Justice Black concurs, dissenting.
There are several states with possible claims to the escheat of intangibles. The state of incorporation of the obligor; the state where the last known owner was domiciled (see Connecticut Ins. Co. v. Moore, 333 U. S. 541); the state where later on the true residence of the owner was proved to be; the state of his last known domicile; the state where the obligor has its main place of business; in case of insurance or trust property, the state of residence (or domicile) of the beneficiary. There may be still other states with claims of an equal or greater dignity to these. In this case we have heard from only one— the state of incorporation.
I think any of several states, including the state of incorporation, might constitutionally enact a custodial statute under which it undertook to hold the escheated intangibles pending determination by this Court of the claims of competing states. New Jersey has not done that. New Jersey undertakes to appropriate to her exclusive use (after a short statute of limitations has run) this vast amount of wealth. Hence, I dissent.

  After argument, we continued this cause to enable the petitioner to apply for a certificate or other expression from the appropriate California courts to show whether the judgments rested on adequate and independent state grounds or whether decision of the federal question was necessary to the judgments rendered. 340 U. S. 622 (1951). Such expressions have been obtained.
 

 
   *492
   
  The Supreme Court has informed us that its refusal to grant a writ of certiorari from the default judgment entered by the Superior Court was based upon petitioner’s failure to utilize the proper channel of review, namely, his failure to appeal from the default judgment. Inasmuch as our jurisdiction to review state court judgments extends only to final judgments rendered “by the highest court of a State in which a decision could be had,” 28 U. S. C. § 1257, we have no jurisdiction to review the proceedings arising from the default judgment.
 

  The District Court of Appeal has informed us that the decision of the federal question was essential to its denial of the application for writ of prohibition, and that its judgment did not rest upon an independent state ground. The expression we have received from the California Supreme Court is also susceptible of the interpretation that its denial of a hearing from the judgment of the District Court of Appeal was based upon an adequate state ground. We do not consider the force of that statement since it is clear that the judgment properly before us is that of, the District Court of Appeal, which did decide the federal question. See
  
   American Railway Express Co.

  The presence of jurisdiction upon petition for writ of certiorari does not, of course, determine the exercise of that jurisdiction, for the issuance of the writ is discretionary. In this case petitioner could have obtained review of the final adjudication of the merits by appealing from the default judgment. The California Supreme Court has apparently refrained from taking action because of the existence of that remedy. In these circumstances we think it advisable not to exercise our jurisdiction.

The Court also finds that the jury improperly interpreted the Smith Act by charging that it required an ""unspecified intent"" before the jury would convict them. The trial judge properly found that petitioner was unwilling to work inside the frame of democracy because the ruling class of that state wouldn't permit the transformation into a peaceful form of government, but would employ force and violence against any peaceful political gain the Communist Party could achieve.

For example, the Supreme Court had held that there was sufficient evidence to support a criminal sentence under the Criminal Empionage Act when the defendant published a pamphlet attacking the government and capitalism. A majority of the court disagreed with these arguments, believing that the First amendment protected speech only when it creates ""clear andpresent danger.""",1951-06-04,1.0

4720,9420609,104914,040dissent,"In this paper, Douglas defends the First Amendment's provision for free speech. He argues that it is not absolute freedom to speak; the teaching methods of terror or other ""seditious"" conduct should be outside the pale with obscence and morality. The Constitution does not make a conspiracy unlawful because petitioners were not charged with committing a conspiracy to overthrowing the government. They were accused of forming a party in which they would teach and advocate against the government through force or violence. If these books were outlawedas under the law, then they would not be allowed to remain on library shelf. However, Douglas points to an analogy between the legal system and the English treasons: when men were punished for thinking murderously thoughts about the king, the framers took steps to prevent the practice from flourishing in England. This analogy makes it clear that there are two kinds of crimes charged by the Constitution: 1) those who believe in the doctrine of revolutionary revolution and want to destroy the government and 2) those who do not believe in what the doctrine says but only for the purpose of doing so. Thus, the crime depends not on whether the teacher believes in the theory but on who his teacher is. Therefore, even if the book itself is outlawd, it would still be illegal to introduce it to a classroom. That would be teaching how the creede of violent overtrow of the government is. It would not have been a crime to introduce these texts to any class, since that would mean teaching what the Creed of vicious overthrow was. As long as the books are not outladyed, however, they will not be considered criminals under the Act. Douglas also contends that the principle of treating speech like the equivalent of Overt acts can be used to violate the Constitution. By invoking such a law, one can turn speech into deed dangerous to society without making it more difficult for people to act upon their ideas.",1951-06-04,1.0
4721,9420610,104915,020lead,"The United States brings this civil action against an Ohio corporation, Timken Roller Bearing Company, for violations of the ""Sherman Act,"" a federal law prohibiting interstate or foreign commerce. The case is brought before the United States Court on appeal. The district court finds that the three companies conspired to restrain competition in the antifrictions bearings market. The parties have agreed to divide trade territories and to limit prices on products sold in the other countries. In 1927, Dewar and his English businessman purchased all the stock from British Timken while Dewar owned about 24% of the company. Since then, both parties have kept these agreements in force. The Districtcourt concludes that the contracting parties violated the ""Shirder Act"" by entering a Comprehensive Decretion designed to bar any future violations. Although the evidence supports the claim that the contracts were legally binding, it does not support the argument that they were so labeleable as to prevent competition among themselves or others. The agreement was intended to avoid competition among itself and others. Thus, the terms of the agreements are illegal because they do not relate to the main purpose of the legal transaction. The only reason why the agreements were such restrictive is because they did not involve a legitimate joint venture between the two companies. Furthermore, the agreements provided for control over the manufacture and sales of anti-friction bears. This conclusion is supported by the fact that American businesses cannot be allowed to sell their American made goods abroad without being forced to sacrifice them in order to maintain export earnings. The most important objection to the decree is that it orders divestitures of the interests of the plaintiff's holdings and other investments in British and France Timken. The majority of the court disagrees with this decision.

I agree with the dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Douglas but wish to emphasize two objections to the opinion of the Court:
1. Our per curiam opinion in Gerende v. Board of Supervisors, 341 U. S. 56, in no way stands for the principle for which the Court cites it today. In Gerende, we upheld a Maryland law that had been interpreted by the highest court of that state to require only an oath' that a candidate “is not a person who is engaged ‘in one way or another in the attempt to overthrow the government by force or violence,’ and that he is not knowingly a member of an organization engaged in such an attempt.” The oath and affidavit in the present case are obviously not so limited.
2. The opinion of the Court creates considerable doubt as to the continued vitality of three of our past decisions: Cummings v. Missouri, 4 Wall. 277; Ex parte Garland, 4 Wall. 333; United States v. Lovett, 328 U. S. 303. To *731this extent it weakens one more of the Constitution’s great guarantees of individual liberty. See, e. g., Dennis v. United States, ante, p. 494, and Breard v. Alexandria, ante, p. 622, decided this day.

Mr. Justice Frankfurter,
dissenting.
The force of the reasoning against divestiture in this case fortifies the doubts which I felt about the Government’s position at the close of argument and persuades me to associate myself, in substance, with the dissenting views expressed by Mr. Justice Jackson. Even “cartel” is not a talismanic word, so as to displace the rule of reason by which breaches of the Sherman Law are determined. Nor is “division of territory” so self-operating a category of Sherman Law violations as to dispense with analysis of the practical consequences of what on paper is a geographic division of territory.
While American Banana Co. v. United Fruit Co., 213 U. S. 347, presented a wholly different set of facts from those before us, the decision in that case does point to the fact that the circumstances of foreign trade may alter the incidence of what in the setting of domestic commerce would be a clear case of unreasonable restraint of trade.
Of course, it is not for this Court to formulate economic policy as to foreign commerce!. But the conditions controlling foreign commerce may be relevant here. When as a matter of cold fact the legal, financial, and governmental policies deny opportunities for exportation from *606this country and importation into it, arrangements that afford such opportunities to American enterprise may not fall under the ban of a fair construction of the Sherman Law because comparable arrangements regarding domestic commerce come within its condemnation.

On May 3, 1943, this Court held that cities and states could not enforce laws which impose flat taxes on the privilege of door-to-door sales of religious literature, Jones v. Opelika, 319 U. S. 103; Murdock v. Pennsylvania, 319 U. S. 105, or which make it unlawful for persons to go from home to home knocking on doors and ringing doorbells to invite occupants to religious, political or other kinds of public meetings. Martin v. Struthers, 319 U. S. 141. Over strong dissents, these laws were held to invade liberty of speech, press and religion in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments. Today a new majority adopts the position of the former dissenters and sustains a city ordinance forbidding door-to-door solicitation of subscriptions to the Saturday Evening Post, Newsweek and other magazines. Since this decision cannot *650be reconciled with the Jones, Murdock and Martin v. Struthers cases, it seems to me that good judicial practice calls for their forthright overruling. But whether this is done or not, it should be plain that my disagreement with the majority of the Court as now constituted stems basically from a different concept of the reach of the constitutional liberty of the press rather than from any difference of opinion as to what former cases have held.
Today’s decision marks a revitalization of the judicial views which prevailed before this Court embraced the “ philosophy that the First Amendment gives a preferred status to the liberties it protects. I adhere to that preferred position philosophy. It is my belief that the freedom of the people of this Nation cannot survive even a little governmental hobbling of religious or political ideas, whether they be communicated orally or through the press.
The constitutional sanctuary for the press must necessarily include liberty to publish and circulate. In view of our economic system, it must also include freedom to solicit paying subscribers. Of course homeowners can if they wish forbid newsboys, reporters or magazine solicitors to ring their doorbells. But when the homeowner himself has not done this, I believe that the First Amendment, interpreted with due regard for the freedoms it guarantees, bars laws like the present ordinance which punish persons who peacefully go from door to door as agents of the press.*

Of course I believe that the present ordinance could constitutionally be applied to a “merchant” who goes from door to door “selling pots.” Compare Martin v. Struthers, 319 U. S. 141, 144 with Valentine v. Chrestensen, 316 U. S. 52.

The employment of union and nonunion men on the same job is a basic protest in trade union history. That was the protest here. The union was not out to destroy the contractor because of his antiunion attitude. The union was not pursuing the contractor to other jobs. All the union asked was that union men not be compelled to work alongside nonunion men on the same job. As Judge Rifkind stated in an analogous case, “the union was not extending its activity to a front remote from the immediate dispute but to one intimately and indeed inextricably united to it.”1
The picketing would undoubtedly have been legal if there had been no subcontractor involved — if the general *693contractor had put nonunion men on the job. The presence of a subcontractor does not alter one whit the realities of the situation; the protest of the union is precisely the same. In each the union was trying to protect the job on which union men were employed. If that is forbidden, the Taft-Hartley Act makes the right to strike, guaranteed by § 13, dependent on fortuitous business arrangements that have no significance so far as the evils of the secondary boycott are concerned. I would give scope to both § 8 (b) (4) and § 13 by reading the restrictions of § 8 (b) (4) to reach the case where an industrial dispute spreads from the job to another front.2

I cannot agree that under our decisions the oath is valid. United States v. Lovett, 328 U. S. 303; Ex parte Garland, 4 Wall. 333; Cummings v. Missouri, 4 Wall. 277. The oath is so framed as to operate retrospectively as a perpetual bar to those employees who held certain views at any time since a date five years preceding the effective date of the ordinance. It leaves no room for a change of heart. It calls for more than a profession of present loyalty or promise of future attachment. It is not limited in retrospect to any period measured by reasonable relation to the present. In time this ordinance will amount to the requirement of an oath that the affiant has never done any of the proscribed acts. Cf. Gerende v. Board of Supervisors, 341 U. S. 56; American Communications Assn. v. Douds, 339 U. S. 382, 413-414.
The oath is not saved by the fact that it reaches back only to December 6, 1943, and that city employees have been forbidden since April 28, 1941, under § 432 of the Los Angeles Charter, to advise, teach or advocate the violent overthrow of the Government.

We have before us only the question of whether municipal employees may be required to give to their employer factual information which is relevant to a determination of their present loyalty and suitability for public service. Such loyalty and suitability is no less material in candidates for appointment as municipal employees than in candidates for elective office, Gerende v.

This order also prohibits anyone from making any further demands on the company's stock. In addition, there is an appeal to the United States Court for the northern district of California to adjudicate its claim of ownership in the same share of stock as these cases. On June 1st, 1951, the courts begin hearing arguments on a move to dismiss the suit and for summary judgement. Justice Frankfurtar does not join either party in the decision. The case concerns the ownership of nine2% of the dollar steamship lines which were originally owned by the Union Merchant Marine Company. It was brought against the Board of Trustees in their individual capacity. The action had been dismissed because the board did not have consent to the lawsuit. However, after four and one half years, the court has reconsidered the decisions. The members of both parties are now entitled to possession but do not have the right to sell or transfer the stock. They are ordered to deliver the stock back to the representatives who purchased it. A new proceeding takes place in California where the government seeks relief from the owners of all the shares. The Government requests that the dollars be allowed to exercise or attempt to exercise anyrights or privileges at the hands of the corporations owner. The Federal Maritime Council claims that the management of the ship is ""shockingally incompetental"" and that the money should be used to buy value rather than invest in debt. The Supreme Court issues two more orders ordering the officers of the commerce and the secretary of commerce to show why they cannot be held contempt for refusing to endorse or disinherit the stock certificates. The other orders allow the authorities to use their power to purchase value without being forced to issue new certificates. These orders prevent the creditors from selling or transferring the bonds.

I agree that the judgment of conviction was properly set aside. But my reason strikes deeper than the one on which..the. Court résts its .opinion. There are timehonoiod police methods for obtaining confessions from an *46accused. One is detention without arraignment, the problem we dealt with in McNabb v. United States, 318 U. S. 332. Then the accused is under the exclusive control of the police, subject to their mercy, and beyond the reach of counsel or of friends. What happens behind doors that are opened and closed at the sole discretion of the police is a black chapter in every country — the free as well as the despotic, the modern as well as the ancient. In the McNabb case we tried to rid the federal system of those breeding grounds for coerced confessions.
Another time-honored police method for obtaining confessions is to arrest a man on one charge (often a minor one) and use his detention for investigating a wholly different crime. This is an easy short cut for the police. How convenient it is to make detention the vehicle of investigation! Then the police can have access to the prisoner day and night. Arraignment for one crime gives some protection. But when it is a pretense or used as the device for breaking the will of the prisoner on long, relentless, or repeated questionings, it is abhorrent. We should free the federal system of that disreputable practice which has honeycombed the municipal police system in this country.* We should make illegal such a perversion of a “legal” detention.
The rule I propose would, of course, reduce the “efficiency” of the police. But so do the requirements for arraignment, the prohibition against coerced confessions, the right to bail, the jury trial, and most of our other procedural safeguards. We in this country, however early made the choice — that the dignity and privacy o: the individual were worth more to society than an all-powerful police. ■ • ,
*47We are framing 'here a rule of evidence for .criminal trials in the federal courts. That rule must be drawn in light not of the facts of the particular case but of the system which the particular case reflects. Hence, the fact that the charge on which this respondent was arraigned was not a minor one nor one easily conceived by the police is immaterial. The rule of evidence we announce today gives sanct-on to a police practice swhich makes detention the means of investigation. Therein lies its vice. Hence, we do not reach the question whether a confession so Obtained violates the Fifth Amendment.

Americans justly complain when their fellow citizens in certain European countries.are pounced upon at will by state police, held in jail incommunicado, and later convicted of crime on confessions obtained during such in*74carceration. Yet in part* upon just such a confession, this Court today affirms Nebraska’s conviction of a citizen of Mexico who can neither read nor understand English.
The record shows the following facts without any dispute at all: While working in a field in El Paso County, Texas, on September 19, 1949, the petitioner was arrested by a local deputy sheriff without a warrant. The excuse given for the arrest was that immigration officers had requested it. No charge was ever filed against petitioner in any Texas state court nor was any warrant sworn out against him during the eight, days he was kept in the Texas jail. His detention was incommunicado except for repeated questioning by the deputies. Part of the time petitioner was kept in an 8' x 8' cell with no windows, a cell which a Texas deputy testifying in this case referred to as the “dark room” or the “punishment room,” although petitioner was a “docile prisoner” and did all he was told to do by the officers. It was during this incarceratiofi of eight days that the petitioner gave a confession used to convict him in this case.. As is usual in this type of case the deputies say that the confession was wholly “voluntary”; petitioner says that it was due to fear engendered by his incarceration and the actions of the deputies. Even if the officers’ story should happen to be correct, I believe the Constitution forbids the use of confessions obtained by the kind of secret inquisition these deputies conducted.
There are countries where arbitrary arrests like this, followed by secret imprisonment and systematic question*75ing until confessions are obtained, are still recognized and • permissible legal procedures. See “The Trap Closes” by Robert A. Vogeler with Leigh White, The Saturday Evening Post, November 3, 1951, p. 36 et seq. My own belief is that only, by departure from the Constitution as properly interpreted can America tolerate such practices. See Ashcraft v. Tennessee, 322 U. S. 143, 154-155; Chambers v. Florida, 309 U. S. 227; Bram v. United States, 168 U. S. 532, 556, 562-563. I would reverse this judgment.

During petitioner’s trial an alleged confession made in Texas, an alleged confession made in Nebraska and a plea of guilty entered in a Nebraska court were introduced in evidence against him. His conviction should be reversed if any one of these three items of evidence were secured in violation of due process of law which the Federal Constitution guarantees. For this reason I consider the Texas confession only.

Law has reached its finest moments when it has freed man from the unlimited discretion of some ruler, some civil or military official, some bureaucrat. Where discretion is absolute, man has always suffered. At times it has been his property that has been invaded; at times, his privacy; at times, his liberty of movement; at times, his freedom of thought; at times, his fife. Absolute discretion is a ruthless master. Tt is more destructive of freedom than any of man’s other inventions.
The instant case reveals only a minor facet of the age-long struggle. The result reached by the Court can be rationalized or made plausible by-casting it in terms of contract law: the parties need not have made this contract; those who contract with the Government must turn square corners; the parties will be left where their engagement brought -them. And it may be that in this case the equities are. with the Governmént, not with the contractor. But the rule we announce has wide application and a devastating effect. It makes a tyrant out of every contracting officer. He is granted the power of a tyrant even though he is stubborn, perverse or captious. He is allowed the power of a tyrant though he is incompetent or negligent. He has the power of life and death over a private business even though his decision is grossly ' erroneous. Power granted is seldom neglected.
*102The principle of checks and balances is a healthy one. An official who is accountable will act more prudently. A citizen who has an appeal to a body independent of the controversy has protection against passion, obstinacy, irrational conduct, and incompetency of an official. The opinion by Judge Madden in this case expresses a revulsion to allowing one man an uncontrolled discretion over another’s fiscal affairs. We should allow the Court of Claims, the agency close to these disputes, to reverse an official whose conduct 'is plainly out of bounds whether he is fraudulent, perverse, captious, incompetent, or just palpably wrong. The rule we announce makes government oppressive. The rule the Court of Claims espouses gives a citizen justice even against his government.

First. If the Shannons were the only plaintiffs in the action, I assume that the Anti-Assignment Act, R. S. § 3477; would bar a recovery. But the Shannons — the assignees — have joined the Boshamers — the assignors— as defendants. Hence all the parties who can possibly be affected by the assignment are before the Court. Certainly the Boshamers could recover from the United States and, if the assignment were treated as void (as against the United States), any recovery by the Bosham*298ers would in equity belong to the Shannons. See Martin v. National Surety Co., 300 U. S. 588, 597. If they can recover, I see no reason, except a narrow conceptual one, why in this proceeding the entire controversy cannot be settled. The judgment obtained by the Boshamers against the United States would in good conscience have to be held in trust for the Shannons.
Second. The suggestion that the writ be dismissed as improvidently granted raises a recurring problem in the administration of the business of the Court. ' A Justice who has voted to deny the writ of certiorari is in no position after argument to vote to dismiss the writ as improvidently granted. Only those who have voted to grant the writ have that privilege. The reason strikes deep. If after the writ is granted or after argument, those who voted to deny certiorari vote to dismiss the writ as improvidently granted, the integrity of our certiorari jurisdiction is impaired. By long practice — announced to the Congress and well-known to this Bar — it takes four votes out of a Court of nine to grant a petition for certiorari. If four can grant and the opposing five dismiss, then the four cannot get a decision of the case on the merits. The integrity of the four-vote rule on certiorari would then be impaired.

Mr. Justice Douglas,
with whom Mr. Justice Reed and Mr. Justice Burton concur, dissenting.
I think this case deserves a decision on the merits. There is no group more interested in the operation and management of the public schools than the taxpayers who' support them and the parents whose children attend them. Certainly a suit by all the taxpayers to enjoin, a practice authorized by the school board would be a suit by vital parties in interest. They would not be able to show, any more than the two present taxpayers have done, that the reading of the Bible adds to the taxes they pay. But if they were right in their contentions on the merits, they would establish that their public schools were being deflected from the educational program for which the taxes were raised. That seems to me to be an adequate interest for the maintenance of this suit by all the taxpayers. If all can do it, there is no apparent reason why less than all may not, the interest being the same. ■ In the present case the issues are not feigned; the suit is not collusive; the mismanagement of the school system that is alleged is clear and plain.
If this were a suit to enjoin a federal law, it could not be maintained by reason of Massachusetts v. Mellon, 262 U. S. 447, 486. But New Jersey can fashion her own *436rules governing the institution of suits in her courts. If she wants to give these taxpayers the status to sue (by analogy to the right of shareholders to enjoin ultra vires acts of their corporation), I see nothing in the Constitution to prevent it. And where the clash of interests is as real and as strong as it is here, it is odd indeed to hold there is no case or controversy within the meaning of Art. Ill, § 2 of the Constitution.

dissenting.
While I fully agree with the dissent of Mr. Justice Douglas, the importance of this holding prompts me to add these thoughts.
This is another of those rapidly multiplying legislative enactments which make it dangerous — this time for school *497teachers — to think or say anything except what a transient majority happen to approve at the moment. Basically these laws rest on the belief that government should supervise and limit the flow of ideas into the minds of men. The tendency of such governmental policy is to mould people into a common intellectual pattern. Quite a different governmental policy rests on the belief that government should leave the ,mind and spirit of man absolutely free. Such a governmental policy encourages varied intellectual outlooks in the belief that the best views will prevail. This policy of freedom is in my judgment embodied in the First Amendment and made applicable to the states by the,Fourteenth. Because of this policy public officials cannot be constitutionally vested with powers to select the ideas people can think about, censor the public views they can'express, or choose the persons or groups people can associate with. Public officials with such powers are not public servants; they are public masters.
I dissent from the Court’s judgment sustaining this law which effectively penalizes school teachers for their thoughts and their associates.

  Appellants contend that only a court of three judges has jurisdiction over the cause. No. 120 is an appeal from the order dissolving the three-judge court brought directly to this Court under 28 U. S. C. (Supp. IV) § 1253. We set the appeal down for argument, postponing consideration of jurisdictional questions. In No. 159 Misc., appellants asked, in the alternative, that we issue a writ of mandamus to vacate the order dissolving the three-judge court. We issued a rule to show cause why the petition for mandamus should not be granted, 342 U. S. 846, and, upon the filing of a response to the rule, set the petition down for argument with the appeal.
 

  At the argument, counsel for appellees stated that appellants would be admitted to the University of Tennessee as requested. Thereafter, appellants filed a motion stating that appellant Gray has been admitted to the University and that the other appellants were, because of changed circumstances, unable to avail themselves of the opportunity at present. Appellants moved this Court to vacate the order dissolving the three-judge court and to remand the case to that court for further proceedings. Since appellants’ requests for admission to the University of Tennessee have been granted and since there is no suggestion that any person “similarly situated” will not be afforded similar treatment, appellants’ motion is denied and the judgments below are vacated and the District Court is directed to dismiss the action upon the ground that the cause is moot.

He believes that courts must have power to punish for condemned behavior without constitutional safeguards necessary to ensure fairness and impartiality. The case of the eleven communist leaders who testify against the United States on charges of conspiring against the government has been decided by the Court. Although the trial judge found contempt for the petitioners, the court reversed the verdict because it did not find them guilty of conspiracy. The question at issue is whether the district judge had sufficient time to hear the charges before he could decide whether they were personally guilty or not. In this particular case, however, the judge was too involved in the entire trial to be directly involved in making the charge against him. However, his personal feelings toward the defense lawyers are clearly shown in the testimony of the prosecution's witnesses. This evidence supports the argument that the judge feels deeply involved in these cases. It also suggests that another judge would have tried the matter more severely than the previous judge. Thus, even though the other judge might have punished the same contempt as the first judge, there is still no need for further delay during the trial; instead, the Judge can keep order with occasional recesses from the counsel. A second judge may try the contempt problem alone, but only when the judge himself is involved. If the judge finds the Petitioners guilty of such contempt, then the punishment will be peremptorous. Assuming that the judges do not believe that their own actions are impersonal, one cannot imagine how any other judge should have felt about the conduct of the lawyer.

Mr. Justice Black,

The only thing certain about § 20 (c) of the Immigration Act of 1917, as amended, is that violation of its terms is a felony punishable by ten years’ imprisonment. An alien ordered deported by the Bureau of Immigration is subject to this ten-year penalty if he “willfully fail or refuse to make timely application in good faith for travel or other documents necessary to his departure.” To avoid punishment an alien must guess with unerring accuracy what answers a judge or jury1 might someday give to the following questions: (1) When is an application “timely”? (2) What constitutes a “good faith” application? (3) What kind of “documents” are “necessary to his departure”? (4) To whom must he apply for these documents?
Aliens living in this country are not necessarily sophisticated world travelers familiar with the present-day red *174tape that must be unwound to get from one country to another. Congress should at least indicate when, to whom, and for what the alien should apply. If, for example, the statute merely required an alien to report at a certain time and place to sign “documents” collected by the American Department of State, the affirmative conduct demanded would at least be clear and specific. But the present statute, in my judgment, entangles aliens in a snare of vagueness from which few can escape. I think the Constitution requires more than a “bad” guess to make a criminal.2.

 “In earlier times, some Rulers placed their criminal laws where the common man could not see them, in order that he might be entrapped into their violation. Others imposed standards of conduct impossible of achievement to the end that those obnoxious to the ruling powers might be convicted under the forms of law. No one of them ever provided a more certain entrapment, than a statute which prescribes a penitentiary punishment for nothing more than a layman's failure to prophesy what a judge or jury will do. . . .” Williams v.

My views on the illegality of confessions obtained between the time of arrest and arraignment are contained in Watts v. Indiana, 338 U. S. 49, 56-57; Turner v. Pennsylvania, 338 U. S. 62, 66-67; Harris v. South Carolina, 338 U. S. 68, 71-73. The practice of obtaining confes*204sions prior to arraignment breeds the third-degree and the inquisition. As long as it remains lawful for the police to hold persons incommunicado, coerced confessions will infect criminal trials in violation of the commands of due process of law.
The facts of this case illustrate the evils of this police practice. While the defendant was being held by the police prior to his arraignment, a lawyer tried to see him. The police refused the lawyer’s repeated requests. It was only after a confession was obtained that the lawyer was allowed to talk with the prisoner. This was lawless conduct, condemned by the Supreme Court of California. It was not only lawless conduct; it was conduct that produced a confession.
This confession as well as subsequently obtained confessions were used at the trial. The fact that the later confessions may have been lawfully obtained or used is immaterial. For once an illegal confession infects the trial, the verdict of guilty must be set aside no matter how free of taint the other evidence may be. Malinski v. New York, 324 U. S. 401.
Moreover, the fact that the accused started talking shortly after he was arrested and prior to the time he was taken before the District Attorney does not save the case. That talk was accompanied or preceded by blows and kicks of the police; and the Supreme Court of California assumed that it was part and parcel of the first confession obtained through “physical abuse or psychological torture or a combination of the two.”

Mr. Justice Black,
dissenting.
Petitioner, a United States citizen, is now serving a fifteen-year sentence for murdering her husband. At the time of the alleged crime, she was living in the United States Area of Control in Germany with her husband who was an Air Force lieutenant on active duty in Germany. It appears that the court that tried her and the law she was judged by were not established or authorized by the *372Congress. Executive officers acting under presidential authority created the system of courts that tried her, promulgated the edicts she was convicted of violating, and appointed the judges who took away her liberty.
The very first Article of the Constitution begins by saying that “All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress” and no part of the Constitution contains a provision specifically authorizing the President to create courts to try American citizens. Whatever may be the scope of the President’s power as Commander in Chief of the fighting armed forces, I think that if American citizens in present-day Germany are to be tried by the American Government, they should be tried under laws passed by Congress and in courts created by Congress under its constitutional authority.

4855,9420740,105005,020lead,"Swift and Company file a complaint before the Illinois Commerce Court, alleging unreasonable charges on directcarload shipments from points outside of Illinois to its new plant in Chicago. The complainant, Swift, seeks joint through rates that will not include delivery of livestock directly to Swift's industrial siding as a result of the proposed plant being located on Junction's rails instead of those of any other carrier. Swift appeals to the court to dismiss the complaint so that the commission can hear both sides together on consolidated records. In order to avoid further delays, Swift asks for an increase in the switching charge to be added to the current rate. The court responds that this is unreasonable because it does not consider the different nature of the services required by cattle as compared to dead freight. It also rejects the argument that since dead freight is moved directly to stock yards at the line haul rate, there is a distinction between these two types of transportation. The carriers do not make direct shipments; rather, they deliver them directly to the stock yards where all the livestock are delivered. There are only a limited number of plants in the area with trackage rights above the Junction railroad tracks which lead to their plants. All the livestock reaches the stockyards without having been routed through the stock yards. If the lawsuit were granted, however, livestock would have to be handled in less time than it is now required to do. The case goes on to argue that the switching charge provided by existing tariffs would not be unfair or otherwise unlawful when applied to livestock. Furthermore, the establishment of joints for such transportation did not need to be done in the interest of public interest. However, the decision was not overturned. The courts had considered several arguments against the charging of switching charges but found that the prices were reasonable.

Mr. Justice Frankfurter,
dissenting.
The conflicting views of my brethren imply serious differences in interpreting the meaning and scope of the report of the Interstate Commerce Commission. Plainly, therefore, that report does not speak with the needed clarity. Therein lies my difficulty with the case. If what the Commission has done is ambiguous, how can I decide whether it was authorized to do what it did? Dubiety in the administrative order precludes intelligible judicial review.
As the Court views the matter, the Commission had before it merely a rate-fixing controversy and more specifically whether relevant transportation considerations justified imposition of a local switching charge of 4.8 cents per 100 pounds* in combination with the line-haul charge as a fair rate for delivery of livestock to private sidings. And *389the record, according to the Court, amply sustains the finding of the Commission that such a combination did not constitute an unreasonable rate. Mr. Justice Reed and Mr. Justice Douglas interpret the order not to be a rate-fixing order at all, but, in effect, a determination by the Interstate Commerce Commission that livestock, unlike all other commodities, may be excluded from private sidings in the stockyards area, although this is done not in terms but by a designedly preferential rate. The difficulty is, of course, intensified in that the rate is in fact prohibitive.
Where, as here, this Court can draw only conflicting strands of reason from the explanation given by the Interstate Commerce Commission, we have not been spoken to with sufficient clearness. “We must know what a decision means before the duty becomes ours to say whether it is right or wrong.” United States v. Chicago, M., St. P. & P. R. Co., 294 U. S. 499, 511. Therefore, I think the decision below should be reversed with direction to remand the case to the Interstate Commerce Commission for appropriate action.

 This rate, in effect when the hearing was held, was based on a minimum of 60,000 pounds.

After being advised by the Supreme Court of Oklahoma that this repeal had no effect on these causes, we noted probable jurisdiction and heard argument.
 

  Appellants contend that this statute and an order issued thereunder by the Oklahoma Corporation Commission impair their contractual rights in violation of U. S. Const., Art. I, § 10, and amount to a denial of the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. Specifically, appellants argue that the statute is an unreasonable exercise of the State’s police power and an unreasonable delegation of legislative and judicial power to private groups. In addition, appellants maintain that the statute is too vague and indefinite to furnish the Commission with any reasonable guide for the issuance of orders approving unitization plans, and that the evidence does not support the Commission’s findings of fact.
 

  In the light of our previous decisions, appellants have failed to raise any substantial federal questions and the appeals are therefore dismissed.

The threshold question in this case is whether petitioner renounced his United States citizenship and became expatriated by reason of acts committed in Japan during the War. Prior to 1943, petitioner was regarded by Japanese authorities as an enemy alien. In March, 1943, petitioner gave official notice of his allegiance to Japan by having his name registered in the family Koseki. Thereafter, petitioner had his name removed from police *746records as an enemy alien, secured employment subject to military control at a munitions plant, traveled to China on a Japanese passport, and prayed daily for the Emperor’s health and a Japanese victory. These facts and petitioner’s heinous treatment of American prisoners of war, recited in the opinion of the Court, convince us that petitioner, for over two years, was consistently demonstrating his allegiance to Japan, not the United States. As a matter of law, he expatriated himself as well as that can be done.
Petitioner’s statements that he was still a citizen of the United States — made in order to obtain a United States passport after Japan had lost the War — cannot restore citizenship renounced during the War. Because we conclude, on this record, that petitioner’s whole course of conduct was inconsistent with retention of United States citizenship, we would reverse petitioner’s conviction of treason against the United States.

He contends that such legislation would go beyond ""due process of law"" under the Due-Process clause of the Fourth Amendment and would lead to states adopting their own criminal justice systems. This is because the concept of justice has been dominated in the nineteenth century by jurors who believe that it is impossible for a man's act to be committed without proof of guilt. It is therefore necessary for the government to have a system in place to ensure that there is no doubt that a person is guilty of the crime. However, as long as the state chooses one test for determining culpibility rather than another, it will be unfair to deny someone life or liberty when he cannot demonstrate sufficient proof of his innocence. Therefore, courts must devise a way to determine whether a murderer is responsible for the killing. For example, if a police officer tells a jury that armed men are incapable of acting properly, then the police officer should make sure that the charges against the officer are made out of evidence of physical violence.

I agree with all that Mr. Justice Frankfurter has said in upholding the action of the Court of Appeals in returning the case to the District Court with directions to enter a verdict for the defendant. I would add another reason why I think the action was valid.
After the Cone, Globe Liquor and Fountain cases were decided, Congress in 1948 revised the Judicial Code, and in 28 U. S. C. § 2106 clearly authorized the action taken by the Court of Appeals here. Section 2106 reads as follows:
“The Supreme Court or any other court of appellate jurisdiction may affirm, modify, vacate, set aside or reverse any judgment, decree, or order of a court lawfully brought before it for review, and may remand the cause and direct the entry of such appropriate judgment, decree, or order, or require such further proceedings to be had as may be just under the circumstances.”
To me, this statute is controlling. We found it controlling of the action of the Court of Appeals in a criminal case. Bryan v. United States, 338 U. S. 552. Mr. Justice Black, who now speaks for the Court, dissented in the Bryan case because he thought Cone controlling. By act of Congress, the discretion now rests with the Court of Appeals to grant a new trial or to direct a verdict according to law on the record already made.

   Bolling et al.
  
  v.
  
   Sharpe et al.,
  
  No. 11,018 on that court’s docket. In that case, the appellants challenge the appellees’ refusal to admit certain Negro appellants to a segregated white school in the District of Columbia; they allege that appellees have taken such action pursuant to certain Acts of Congress; they allege that such action is a violation of the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution.
 

  The Court is of the opinion that the nature of the issue posed in those appeals now before the Court involving the Fourteenth Amendment, and also the effect of any decision which it may render in those cases, are such that it would be well to consider, simultaneously, the constitutional issue posed in the case of
  
   Bolling et al.

  to resolve the deadlock indicated in the certificate and give full review to the entire case. This Court does not normally review orders of administrative agencies in the first instance; and the Court does not desire to take any action at this time which might foreclose the possibility of such review in the Court of Appeals.
 

  For these reasons the Board’s application is denied.

Mr. Justice Douglas,
dissenting.
This decision gives a capricious twist to the law. One would assume from a reading of the opinion in Wong Yang Sung v. McGrath, 339 U. S. 33, that the failure of a federal agency to use the type of examiner prescribed by Congress in the Administrative Procedure Act, 60 Stat. 237, 5 U. S. C. § 1001 et seq., vitiated the proceedings whether objection was raised or not. The Congress de*41cided to separate the judicial functions of examiners from the investigative and prosecuting functions. It required the separation in cases involving property interests as well as those involving personal liberty. It condemned as unfair a practice which had grown up of allowing one man to be the police officer, the prosecutor, and the judge.
Violation of that requirement led the Court in Wong Yang Sung’s case to issue a writ of habeas corpus to save an alien from deportation where the hearing examiner did not meet the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act. That was a collateral attack on the administrative proceeding, successfully made even though no objection to the examiner was raised at the hearing.*
The objection raised in the present case likewise was not made at the hearing; but it was made before review of the order had been completed. It would seem, therefore, that reversal of this administrative order would follow a fortiori from Wong Yang Sung’s case.
No one knows how the commingling of police, prosecutor and judicial functions in one person may affect a particular decision. In some situations it might make no difference; in others it might subtly corrupt the administrative process. The only important consideration for us is that Congress has condemned the practice; and we as supervisors of the federal system should see to it that the law is enforced, not selectively but in all cases coming before us.
Of course, an agency that flouts the mandate for fair examiners does not lose jurisdiction of the case. Even habeas corpus is no longer restricted to the testing of “jurisdiction” in the historic sense. See Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U. S. 458, 467; Bowen v. Johnston, 306 U. S. *4219, 24. But the action of the Commission in the present case created an error that permeates the entire proceeding. It is error that goes to the very vitals of the case. I would therefore set aside the order and send the case back for a hearing that meets the statutory standards of fairness. I would make the rule of Wong Yang Sung’s case good for more than the day and the occasion.

And the alien in that case, like the respondent here, was represented by counsel in the administrative proceedings.

The court reverses the railroad, finding that the verdict was excessive and should have been set aside because it was contrary to law. Two months later, however, the court denies the motion for judgment on the grounds of excessive evidence. The case also addresses whether the Court can consistently direct a judgment with Rule 50-b of the Federal rules of civil procedure. Although the petitioner makes several motions to set apart the verdict, none of them do so as instructed by the court. It does not seem to be interested in setting aside the verdict but rather wants relief from the fact that the district court has no power to enter such an order. In contrast, the respondent contends that the trial judge's express reservation regarding a motion ""relieves"" the party from any obligation to make another motion after the verdict; this argument is uncontradicted by the courts' previous cases which have held that judges must reserve their decisions on a particular motion for directed jury verdict.

dissenting.
At the times relevant here Congress made the taking of “an oath of allegiance to any foreign state” the ground for loss of American citizenship. 34 Stat. 1228, 8 U. S. C. § 17. The findings of the District Court in this case state that “On May 24, 1931, the plaintiff took an oath of allegiance to the King of Italy.” That finding is uncon-troverted here and the precise circumstances surrounding the taking of the oath are unexplained. All we know is that plaintiff, without protest, was inducted into the *140Italian Army and served there from April 14, 1931, to September 5, 1931.
If we are to base our decision on the record, we would be compelled to affirm. For it is plain that petitioner did take an oath of allegiance to a foreign state. The Court, however, ignores the record and rests on an opinion of the Attorney General in another case (cf. Mr. Justice Jackson concurring, McGrath v. Kristensen, 340 U. S. 162, 176), saying that one who took an oath in the Army of Fascist Italy did so under duress. We have no basis for knowing that every inducted soldier who took an oath in Mussolini’s army did so under duress. For all we know, this American citizen took the oath freely and gladly. At least, he took it. If we acted in the role of Secretary of State or Attorney General, we might exercise our discretion in favor of the citizen and decide not to move against him on such a showing. But we sit not as cabinet officers but as judges to decide cases on the facts of the records before us.

After the War, respondents demand compensation for everything that had been used either used nor destroyed by the army. The government pays for the petroleum supplies and transportation equipment that were either used during or destroyed bythe army, but it refuses to compensate them for these destructions.

Both cases involve bridges which were destroyed during the Confederacy's retreating northern army. These cases deal with issues of private loss. They argue that the general exercised ""deliberation"" in ordering the destruction of such property as they did at Pearl Harbor. It was not intended for subsequent use because it was destroyed so valuable that the American would better and sooner defeat the enemy.

I have no doubt that the military had authority to select this particular property for destruction. But whatever the weight of authority may be, I believe that the Fifth Amendment requires compensation for the taking. The property was destroyed, not because it was in the nature of a public nuisance, but because its destruction was deemed necessary to help win the war. It was as clearly appropriated to that end as animals, food, and supplies requisitioned for the defense effort. As the Court says, the destruction of this property deprived the enemy of a valuable logistic weapon.
It seems to me that the guiding principle should be this: Whenever the Government determines that one person’s property — whatever it may be — is essential to the war effort and appropriates it for the common good, the public purse, rather than the individual, should bear the loss.

The question presented is the power of the state court to issue a temporary injunction in this kind of labor dispute. If petitioners had sought mandamus or another appropriate state writ directed against the judge who issued the temporary injunction, I should have no doubt that it would be a final judgment which we would review. See Bandini Co. v. Superior Court, 284 U. S. 8, 14. Cf. Rescue Army v. Municipal Court, 331 U. S. 549, 565. I see no difference of substance between that case and this. The mischief of temporary injunctions in labor controversies is well known. It is done when the interlocutory order is issued. The damage is often irreparable. The assertion by the state court of power to act in an interlocutory way is final. Whether it has that power may be determined without reference to any future proceedings which may be taken. Unless the rule of finality is to be *182purely mechanical, which to date it has not been (see Radio Station WOW v. Johnson, 326 U. S. 120, 124), we should determine now whether the National Labor Relations Act permits a state court to interfere with a labor controversy in a way, which though interim in form, irretrievably alters the status of the dispute or in fact settles it.*

If the only question involved in this case were the applicability to prosecutions in State courts, in situations like the present, of § 605 of the Federal Communications Act, 47 U. S.

The matter is complicated, however, by a Texas statute (Art. 727a, Vernon’s Code of Criminal Procedure (1948)) which renders inadmissible in criminal trials evidence obtained in violation of any provision “of the Constitution of the United States.” If this limitation means, according to Texas law, that the State court is to construe what is or is not a violation under the United States Constitution, it does not raise a federal question. But if the Texas legislation means that the Texas courts are bound by what this Court deems a violation of the United States Constitution, the problem is, or might be, different. See State Tax Commission v. Van Cott, 306 U. S. 511. While, on the latter assumption, the circumstances attending the evidence that was admitted here would, in my view, render it inadmissible in a federal prosecution, see my dissent in On Lee v. United States, 343 U. S. 747, 758, the decision of this Court was to the contrary. Therefore the Texas court was in duty bound to follow that decision and to reach the result it reached even if it felt constrained, as apparently it did, to be governed *205by the views of this Court as to what constitutes a violation of the United States Constitution. I cannot say that the Texas court should have followed my minority views, to which I adhere, on this constitutional question, and disregarded the Court’s authority.

The court responds to several appeals brought against the provisions in the Act that prohibit the use and transfer of equipment by motor carriers who are not authorized to do so because of their fitness and ability as drivers. Although the act does not specifically exempt certain types of transportation, such as agricultural products, it does not allow owners to use nonowned equipment on their own. Because of these limitations, many carriers have developed ""a wide practice"" of using non-owned equipment in order to satisfy their needs for equipment as service demands. These practices affect the regulation of the Act; the public interest is in necessary service; and the economic instability of the industry. However, some evidence supports the claim that there are situations in which the lease and interchange agreements create conditions inconsistent with those set out in the law.

The Act does not try to break this system, however, but leaves motor carriers free from the restrictions on how they can add to their fleet as development of its business and the needs of the public demanded. This provision makes it impossible for motor carriers to lease or buy equipment which meets the test of safeness. The new regulations put burdensome rules on the power of carriage carriers to limit the ability of them to lease appropriate automobiles. These rules were rejected by the commission's division Y, consisting of commissioners specifically responsible for overseeing motor vehicle affairs.

Mr. Justice Minton,

dissenting.
There is but one question here, and that is whether this respondent was engaged in “maritime employment” at the time of his injury. If he was, then the Longshoremen’s and Harbor Workers’ Compensation Act applies and not the Federal Employers’ Liability Act. That was decided in Nogueira v. New York, N. H. & H. R. Co., 281 U. S. 128. In that case, an employee of a railroad company was trucking interstate freight from the dock onto a car float for loading in a car standing on the car float. He was likened to a stevedore. Here this railroad employee was a brakeman engaged in removing freight cars from a car float by the use of an ordinary switch engine. The cars were in interstate commerce. Preparatory to the removal of the cars from the car float, it was this railroad employee’s duty to let off the brakes. He alleged that while thus engaged, the railroad’s use of a defective brake in violation of the Safety Appliance Act caused him to be thrown from the freight car to the deck of the car float and injured. The car float was upon navigable waters.
Was it maritime employment to get these cars off the car float or was it railroad employment? If this railroad employee had been doing his braking job on land, no one would have thought he was engaged in anything but railroad employment. Does it become maritime employ*343ment because it happened over navigable waters? We think not. The place is the only thing that differentiate^ the situations. Place is admittedly not enough to make what is braking on land other than braking when done over navigable waters. Not only must we look to the place where the accident happened, but of equal importance is the nature of the employment. The nature of the employment is certainly not maritime. It was an ordinary railroad chore, done by an ordinary railroad brakeman. If this were not so, the train crews on trains being ferried across navigable streams in the United States would be employed in maritime service. With the imagination of the Court’s opinion, a train crew, while crossing a bridge with its supports in a navigable stream, would be employed in maritime service.
We would treat this railroad employee as being in law what he was in real life, a railroad brakeman, engaged in interstate commerce and subject to the Federal Employers’ Liability Act, and affirm this judgment.

concurring.
Once it is agreed that the claim here made — freedom from being tried a second time on a criminal charge— must be tested by the independent scope of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and not on the basis of the incorporation of the Fifth Amendment into the Fourteenth, the application of the guarantee of due process to a specific situation makes relevant the specific phrasing of a common result. I, therefore, deem it appropriate to add a word to the Court’s opinion, in which I join.
The judicial history of the Fifth Amendment in prohibiting any person from being “subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb” serves as a good pragmatic confirmation of the compelling reasons why the original Bill of Rights was found to limit the actions of the Federal Government and not those of the States. The conflicting views expressed in Ex parte Lange, 18 Wall. 163; Kepner v. United States, 195 U. S. 100; Trono v. United States, 199 U. S. 521; In re Bradley, 318 U. S. 50; and Wade v. Hunter, 336 U. S. 684, indicate the subtle technical controversies to which the provision of the Fifth Amendment against double jeopardy has given rise. Implications have been found in that provision very different from the mood of fair dealing and *429justice which the Fourteenth Amendment exacts from a State in the prosecution of offenders. A State falls short of its obligation when it callously subjects an individual to successive retrials on a charge on which he has been acquitted or prevents a trial from proceeding to a termination in favor of the accused merely in order to allow a prosecutor who has been incompetent or casual or even ineffective to see if he cannot do better a second time.
Unless we can say that the trial judge was not justified in the circumstances of this ease in concluding that the ground for requesting a mistrial was fair and not oppressive to the accused, we would not be warranted in finding that the State of North Carolina, through its Supreme Court, denied the petitioner due process of law. The record does not seem to me to justify such a finding.

The tax is narrowly confined to salaries, wages, commissions and to the net profits of businesses, professions, and occupations. Many kinds of income are excluded, e. g., dividends, interest, capital gains. The exclusions emphasize that the tax is on the privilege of working or doing business in Louisville. That is the kind of a tax the Kentucky Court of Appeals held it to be. Louisville v. Sebree, 308 Ky. 420, 214 S. W. 2d 248.

The Court reasons that if the man who is building or repairing an interstate highway is “engaged in commerce,” the one who carries cement and gravel to him from a nearby pit is “engaged in the production of goods for commerce.” Yet if that is true, how about the men who produce the tools for those who carry the cement and gravel or those who furnish the materials to make the tools used in producing the cement and gravel? Each would be essential to the highway worker “engaged in commerce.” Yet the circle gets amazingly large once we say that “the production of goods for commerce” includes the “production of goods for those engaged in commerce.” Cf. McLeod v. Threlkeld, 319 U. S. 491.
*18A person who is maintaining or repairing interstate transportation facilities is “engaged in commerce.” Overstreet v. North Shore Corp., 318 U. S. 125. A person who is creating articles destined for the channels of interstate commerce and all others who have such a close and immediate connection with the process as to be an essential or necessary part of it are engaged in “the production of goods for commerce.” See Kirschbaum Co. v. Walling, 316 U. S. 517. If those who serve those “engaged in commerce” are also included, a large measure of cases affecting commerce are brought into the Act. Yet the history of the Act shows that no such extension of the federal domain was intended. See Kirschbaum Co. v. Walling, supra, pp. 522-523. If those whose activities are necessary or essential to support those who are “engaged in commerce” are to be brought under the Act, I think an amendment of the Act would be necessary.

Their customers were the Pennsylvania Turnpike, the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, an airport, an army depot, and a navy depot, all located within the state of Pennsylvania. The concrete was processed for use by these customers on Pennsylvania projects. The Railroad used its concrete for repair and maintenance of its roadbeds over which were operated interstate passenger and freight trains. The Turnpike used its concrete for laying and building “a highway which handles the flow of commerce between the states.” The airport used concrete to build and erect landing fields to accommodate the flow of airplanes in interstate commerce. Other purchasers used their concrete on “projects which aided the flow of commerce, as will be proven by Plaintiff when he has his day in Court.” Thomas was employed in producing and handling the quarry and concrete products.

Nearly one year later, this action is brought. Both parties move for summary judgment but the District Court grants petitioner's motion. The Court dismisses both sides' arguments.

I fail to see how the reproduction of advertising matter which is never used by a newspaper but which indeed is set up only to be thrown away is a service performed for the newspaper. The practice of “setting bogus” is old and deeply engrained in trade union practice. But so *112are other types of “featherbedding.” Congress, to be sure, did not outlaw all “featherbedding” by the Taft-Hartley Act. That Act leaves unaffected the situation where two men are employed to do one man's work. It also, in my view, leaves unaffected the situation presented in Labor Board v. Gamble Enterprises, Inc., post, p. 117.
Mr. Justice Jackson labels the services tendered in that case as “useless and unwanted work.” Certainly it was “unwanted” by the employer — as much unwanted as putting on two men to do one man’s work. But there is no basis for saying that those services were “useless.” They were to be performed in the theatres, providing music to the audiences. The Gamble Enterprises case is not one where the employer was forced to hire musicians who were not used. They were to be used in the theatrical program offered the public. Perhaps the entertainment would be better without them. But to conclude with Mr. Justice Jackson that it would be better would be to rush in where Congress did not want to tread. For Senator Taft reported from Conference that “The Senate conferees, while not approving of feather-bedding practices, felt that it was impracticable to give to a board or a court the power to say that so many men are all right, and so many men are too many.” 93 Cong. Rec. 6441.
But the situation in this case is to me quite different. Here the typesetters, while setting the “bogus,” are making no contribution whatsoever to the enterprise. Their “work” is not only unwanted, it is indeed wholly useless. It does not add directly or indirectly to the publication of the newspaper nor to its contents. It does not even add an “unwanted” page or paragraph. In no sense that I can conceive is it a “service” to the employer. To be sure, the employer has agreed to pay for it. But the agreement was under compulsion. The statute does not *113draw the distinction Mr. Justice Jackson tenders. No matter how time-honored the practice, it should be struck down if it is not a service performed for an employer.
The outlawry of this practice under § 8 (b) (6) of the Taft-Hartley Act might be so disruptive of established practices as to be against the public interest. But the place to obtain relief against the new oppression is in the Congress, not here.

Had I been here in 1949 when Wolf was decided, I would have applied the doctrine of Weeks v. United States, 232 U. S. 383 (1914), to the states. But the Court refused to do so then, and it still refuses today. Thus Wolf remains the law and, as such, is entitled to the respect of this Court’s membership.
Of course, we could sterilize the rule announced in Wolf by adopting a case-by-case approach to due process, in which inchoate notions of propriety concerning local police conduct guide our decisions. But this makes for such uncertainty and unpredictability that it would be impossible to foretell — other than by guesswork — just how brazen the invasion of the intimate privacies of one’s home must be in order to shock itself into the protective arms of the Constitution. In truth, the practical result of this ad hoc approach is simply that when five Justices are sufficiently revolted by local police action, a conviction is overturned and a guilty man may go free. Rochin bears witness to this. We may thus vindicate the abstract principle of due process, but we do not shape the conduct of local police one whit; unpredictable reversals on dissimilar fact situations are not likely to curb the zeal of those police and prosecutors' who may be intent on racking up a high percentage of successful prosecu*139tions. I do not believe that the extension of such a vacillating course beyond the clear cases of physical coercion and brutality, such as Rochin, would serve a useful purpose.
In light of the “incredible” activity of the police here, it is with great reluctance that I follow Wolf. Perhaps strict adherence to the tenor of that decision may produce needed converts for its extinction. Thus I merely concur in the judgment of affirmance.

The Chief Justice and I dissent on the basis of our dissenting opinion in American Newspaper Publishers Association v. Labor Board, ante, p. 100. We cannot perceive a tenable distinction between this and the printers’ “featherbedding” case. To the extent of that consistency, today’s majority and we are in accord. True, the employees there “work” on the keyboard of a Linotype, and here on the keys of a musical instrument. But, real*127istically viewed, one enterprise is as bogus as the other; both are boondoggles which the employer “does not want, does not need, and is not even willing to accept.” The statute, moreover, does not distinguish between modern make-work gimmicks and featherbedding techniques encrusted in an industry’s lore. Congress accorded no preferred position to seasoned unfair labor practices, and § 8 (b)(6) does not recognize prescriptive rights in the law. Custom and tradition can no more deprive employers than employees of statutory rights. Cf. National Labor Relations Board v. Newport News Shipbuilding Co., 308 U.

Mr. Justice Black,
dissenting.
The Court’s holding in this case is one more in a series of recent decisions which fail to protect the right of Americans to speak freely. I join Mr. Justice Douglas’ forceful dissent and wish to add only a few words.
I agree with the Court that the validity of the speech licensing phase of this New Hampshire law was not upheld in Cox v. New Hampshire, 312 U. S. 569. That case merely recognized that the power of a state to regulate streets for traffic purposes carried with it a right to regulate street parades.1 Nothing said there indicated that a state’s power to regulate traffic carried with it a right to censor public speeches or speakers merely because the state did not wish certain speakers to be heard. Here the record shows beyond doubt that objection to Poulos’ talking was not rooted in a permissible regulation as to the time and place street or park speeches could be made. For the New Hampshire Supreme Court tells us that its officials “arbitrarily and unreasonably” refused to grant Poulos a “license” to talk. This shows that the state’s speech licensing officials actually denied Poulos his con*422stitutional right of free speech.2 The Court now holds Poulos can be branded a criminal for making a talk at the very time and place which the State Supreme Court has held its licensing officials could not legally forbid. I do not challenge the Court’s argument that New Hampshire could prosecute a man who refused to follow the letter of the law to procure a license to “run businesses,” “erect structures,” “purchase firearms,” “store explosives,” or, I may add, to run a pawnshop. But the First Amendment affords freedom of speech a special protection ; I believe it prohibits a state from convicting a man of crime whose only offense is that he makes an orderly religious appeal after he has been illegally, “arbitrarily and unreasonably” denied a “license” to talk. This to me is a subtle use of a creeping censorship loose in the land.

 “They [appellants] were not prosecuted for distributing leaflets, or for conveying information by placards or otherwise, or for issuing invitations to a public meeting, or for holding a public meeting, or for maintaining or expressing religious beliefs. Their right to do any one of these things apart from engaging in a ‘parade or procession’ upon a public street is not here involved and the question of the validity of a statute addressed to any other sort of conduct than that complained of is not before us.” Cox v. New Hampshire, 312 U. S. 569, 573.


 In the Superior Court Poulos took the position that the city council’s refusal to “license” him to speak was “arbitrary and unreasonable” and in violation of the right freely to assemble, speak and worship guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The State Supreme Court affirmed the Superior Court’s holding that the council’s refusal was arbitrary and unreasonable.

He contends that an unconstituted statute may have consequences binding on people who are not allowed to exercise their rights under the law. The Constitution says that there will be no law ""which abridge"" the rights of free speech, press, assembly, and religion. A government must keep its hands away from the exercise of these rights. If a person is denied the right to express himself in public, then the state cannot deny him his right to do so. However, if the government decides to regulate or control a certain activity, it adds burden to the citizen's right to speak. This burden is similar to the burden of a regulation when the officials withhold the authority to issue a license because they want to make sure that the individual does not violate the constitution's guarantee of freedom of speech. Even a reasonably-restrained regulation of the Right to Free Speech is not fit for the First amendment. For example, New Hampshire courts have held that a city council can only grant permission to one group of religious men without any prior approval. That would mean that the church could deny use of the park to another group but still refuse to allow the same group to hold a meeting. Therefore, even a fairly-restricted regulation by a state court doesn't fit with the first amendment.",1953-06-08,1.0

Mr. Justice Douglas,
with whom The Chief Justice concurs, dissenting.
The Chief Justice and I, having voted to grant cer-tiorari in this case, would now dismiss it as having been improvidently granted. No principle of law, requiring restatement or clarification,* is involved. We have here only a question whether under the special circumstances of this case there was a frustration of the venture by the seizure of the vessel at Brisbane or at some later point. The District Court found there was not. The Court of Appeals, speaking unanimously through Judge Learned Hand, found that there was. The decision turns on the weighing of many factors and conditions against a background of admiralty practice and custom with which we are nowhere near as familiar as the experienced admiralty judges below. It seems to me quite improvident for us to reweigh the fragments of the evidence which Learned *445Hand, Augustus N. Hand, and Harrie B. Chase, JJ., weighed (see 197 F. 2d 795, 799-801) and to revise the decision which their experienced minds reached on the totality of the facts of the case. Yet if we were to do so we could not escape the conclusion that the voyage had been frustrated at least by the time the Portmar reached Darwin on February 12, 1942. For as the opinion of the Court concedes, by that time the vessel had been emptied of her original cargo and was being loaded with troops, equipment, and armament for “an exceedingly perilous expedition to Koepang, on the Island of Timor, some 500-odd miles northwest of Darwin.” As the Court says:
“This expedition ran into heavy air attacks and turned back. On the 18th of February, the Portmar was at Darwin again, awaiting her turn to dock and discharge the personnel and equipment she had taken on. While thus at anchor on the morning of the 19th, she underwent bombing and strafing by Japanese airplanes and sustained the damage which forced her master to beach her and caused him to abandon her.”
Certainly by the 12th of February the purposes of the venture, commercially speaking, had ended. The ship was now engaged in an enterprise far beyond the voyage contemplated by the parties.

There is, for example, no usurpation of the fact finding function such as we commonly find in cases arising under the Federal Employers’ Liability Act. See Wilkerson v. McCarthy, 336 U. S. 53.

Mr. Justice Jackson,

I am in substantial agreement with the Court’s opinion but differ in emphasis.
The only controlling fact for me is that this Act is on the federal statute books. What someone intended almost a century ago when it was passed, or in the 1890’s when Counselman v. Hitchcock, 142 U. S. 547, was de-*184eided, I do not know. Since the last event, some thirty Congresses have come and gone, something near 15,000 Congressmen have been elected, not allowing for reelection. How many of them knew of Counselman v. Hitchcock, how many felt frustrated by it, and how many would have vented their frustration by repeal, I do not know or care. Congress left the Act on the books, and it was there when this petitioner testified. The only question is what it would mean to a reasonably well-informed lawyer reading it.
I do not think it important whether petitioner was a “voluntary” or “involuntary” witness before the congressional Committee or whether he raised the question of his immunity under the Fifth Amendment. No such qualification appears in the Act. The whole object and usefulness of the statute is to relieve the witness of the risks which might induce him to withhold testimony from Congress. It is very customary for one who is asked for information to appear before a committee without requiring the formality of a subpoena. The Act does not strip one of its protection because he may be a cooperative, or even interested, witness; indeed, its purpose is to protect and thereby encourage cooperation instead of hesitation or resistance.
The statute seems as unambiguous as language can be. If words mean anything, the statute extends its protection to all witnesses, to all testimony, and in all courts. It is easy to see, as this case illustrates, the hazard a witness would run otherwise. A lawyer would be warranted from the face of this Act in advising the witness that he had nothing to fear from frank and complete disclosure to Congress. Thus the Act would have accomplished its obvious purpose of facilitating disclosure.
I cannot see the slightest doubt that Congress has power to enact the statute for that purpose. It does not take anything from Maryland. It does not say Mary*185land cannot prosecute petitioner; it just says she shall not put him to disadvantage on the trial by reason of his cooperation with Congress. It leaves Maryland with complete freedom to prosecute — she just has to work up her own evidence and cannot use that worked up by Congress. The protection to the witness does not extend beyond the' testimony actually received. In this case, petitioner was convicted by the State on the admissions he made before the Senate Committee. Section 3486 was thereby violated, and the conviction should be reversed.

Mr. Justice Frankfurter,
concurring.
The views expressed by my brother Jackson make it important that I state, in joining the Court’s opinion, what I understand the Court to be deciding and what it is not deciding in this case.
What is decided — the only thing the Court decides — is that the Full Faith and Credit Clause does not require Ohio, in disposing of the custody of children in Ohio, to accept, in the circumstances before us, the disposition made by Wisconsin. The Ohio Supreme Court felt itself so bound. This Court does not decide that Ohio would be precluded from recognizing, as a matter of local law, the disposition made by the Wisconsin court. For Ohio to give respect to the Wisconsin decree would not offend *536the Due Process Clause. Ohio is no more precluded from doing so than a court of Ontario or Manitoba would be, were the mother to bring the children into one of these provinces.
Property, personal claims, and even the marriage status (see, e. g., Sherrer v. Sherrer, 334 U. S. 343), generally give rise to interests different from those relevant to the discharge of a State’s continuing responsibility to children within her borders. Children have a very special place in life which law should reflect. Legal theories and their phrasing in other cases readily lead to fallacious reasoning if uncritically transferred to determination of a State’s duty towards children. There are, of course, adjudications other than those pertaining to children, as for instance decrees of alimony, which may not be definitive even in the decreeing State, let alone binding under the Full Faith and Credit Clause. Interests of a State other than its duty towards children may also prevail over the interest of national unity that underlies the Full Faith and Credit Clause. But the child’s welfare in a custody case has such a claim upon the State that its responsibility is obviously not to be foreclosed by a prior adjudication reflecting another State’s discharge of its responsibility at another time. Reliance on opinions regarding out-of-State adjudications of property rights, personal claims or the marital status is bound to confuse analysis when a claim to the custody of children before the courts of one State is based on an award previously made by another State. Whatever light may be had from such opinions, they cannot give conclusive answers.

Mr. Justice Minton,
dissenting.
The opinion of the Court and the dissent of Mr. Justice Jackson deal with a jurisdictional question not raised on the record.
As I understand the law of Ohio, “parents are the legal and natural custodians of their minor children and each parent has an equal right to their custody in the absence of an order, judgment, or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction fixing their custody. Section 8032, General Code. It is well settled that habeas corpus is not the proper or appropriate action to determine, as between parents, who is entitled to the custody of their minor *543children.” In re Corey, 145 Ohio St. 413, 418, 61 N. E. 2d 892, 894-895.
The instant case was a proceeding in Ohio by habeas corpus brought by the father against the mother for the possession of the minor children. The father could not succeed in this habeas corpus action unless he could show that he had an order of a court of competent jurisdiction awarding him the custody of the children. He produced an authenticated copy of a decree of the County Court of Waukesha County, Wisconsin, valid on its face and un-appealed from, which awarded him the custody of the children. It is not contended that this decree is void upon its face, nor did appellant, the mother, challenge its validity in Ohio by any responsive pleading to the petition for habeas corpus.
The only question before the Ohio court was whether that court should give full faith and credit to the Wisconsin decree. That unappealed decree was valid on its face, and its validity was not attacked by any pleading. The validity of the decree is not affected by any admission in this case, on or off the record. As far as this record is concerned, the decree of the Wisconsin court was what it purported to be on its face. Since appellant failed to challenge its validity by any pleading, the decree was entitled to full faith and credit in Ohio under Art. IV, § 1 of the United States Constitution. The Ohio court properly accorded the decree full faith and credit, and it was evidence, together with parenthood, which proved the father’s right to possession of the children and entitled him to succeed in the proceeding.
I would therefore affirm.

The facts that make a prima facie case of discrimination in the selection of petitioner’s jury are as follows. The population of Fulton County is 691,797. Negroes comprise 25% or 165,814. The tax receiver’s digest from which the jury list is selected has 105,035 white citizens and 17,736 Negroes — 14%. The jury list for the year in question had 20,509 white and 1,115 Negroes — 5%. From that list a number, 150 to 200, were drawn for service on each of the divisions of the court. Evidently these were for a week or a term’s service. The venire from which the trial jury for Avery was selected numbered 60. All were white.
These facts establish a prima facie case of discrimination which the record does not rebut.

It is undisputed that the drawings here were made from a box containing white and colored slips differentiated according to racial lines, white for white veniremen and yellow for colored. The slips were indiscriminately *564placed in the box and were drawn from the box by a county court judge. There was testimony from a recent member of the county Board of Jury Commissioners that the use of these white and yellow slips was designed for purposes of racial discrimination, and it has not been shown that they could serve any other purpose. So far as the particular facts of this case are concerned, we may accept the testimony of the judge who drew the slips from the box as to the honesty of his purpose; that testimony does not refute the fact that there were opportunities to discriminate, as experience tells us there will inevitably be when such differentiating slips are used. In this case the opportunities are obvious, partly because the aperture in the box was sufficiently wide to make open to view the color of the slips and partly because of the subsequent use or abuse that could be made of the slips however fairly drawn. However that may be, opportunity for working of a discriminatory system exists whenever the mechanism for jury selection has a component part, such as the slips here, that differentiates between white and colored; such a mechanism certainly cannot be countenanced when a discriminatory result is reached. The stark resulting phenomenon here was that somehow or other, despite the fact that over 5% of the slips were yellow, no Negro got onto the panel of 60 jurors from which Avery’s jury was selected. The mind of justice, not merely its eyes, would have to be blind to attribute such an occurrence to mere fortuity.
Accordingly, I concur in the judgment.

I agree that the District Court and the Court of Appeals erroneously referred to the wrong venue statute in deciding the question of “doing business.” Like Mr. Justice Black I think it unfortunate that this case must be prolonged by a remand to consider again the same “doing business” question under another statute. Unlike Mr. Justice Black, however, I find nothing in the majority opinion to suggest that the enlightened rationale of our more recent cases such as International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U. S. 310, has been abandoned or impaired. Nor do I find any hint in the majority opinion that anything in the Constitution or other federal law prohibits the trial of this case in a United States District Court in Florida. My objection is that the majority have not ruled on this question at all.

The appeal to Congress is that the Act prohibits sellers who induce or receive price discriminations which are prohibited by the Act. This argument is further complicated by the fact that it does not require proof of cost savings. A buyer must prove that he received a price below the price offered by another buyer. If the buyer knows that the price differs from the advertised price, then the buyer will be liable for the price differential.

Me. Justice Douglas,
dissenting.
I agree with the Court that it is necessary under the Federal Communications Act to establish that the licensing of a competitive service offers a reasonable expectation of some beneficial effect, measured by the public interest. That was indeed the view of the Court of Appeals. But on this record the facts are that
—existing facilities are in excess of those required to handle present and expected traffic;
—the proposed operations will redistribute present traffic rather than generate new traffic;
—the proposed service will not lower rates nor speed up transmission nor improve the existing service in any respect;
—the proposed service will aid Mackay financially and be detrimental to RCA;
—this is a field where without the proposed service there is active competition and an excess of facilities to meet present or expected needs.
I therefore agree with Judge Edgerton’s opinion for the Court of Appeals (91 U. S. App. D. C. 289, 201 F. 2d 694) that on this showing the Commission acted without authority and that its order should be set aside. On the record before us the facts are so unequivocal that there is no apparent way for the Commission to meet the standard approved both here and below. There is therefore no occasion for a remand. I would affirm the judgment below.

It was discovered that the same truck had been used by the four men involved in the murder. All were charged with murder.

I do not think this case belongs in the “twilight zone” of Davis v. Department of Labor, 317 U. S. 249, 256. Recovery was allowed under the Longshoremen’s and Harbor Workers’ Compensation Act for a death which occurred on a barge drawn up for repairs on a marine railway. Norton v. Vesta Coal Co., 63 F. 2d 165, was such *367a case and Judge Woolley dissented from a holding that a marine railway was not included in the statutory language, “any dry dock.”
As Judge Woolley explained, there are three kinds of dry docks. (1) A floating dry dock, as its name makes clear, floats on the water, the vessel resting on the bottom of the dry dock after the water has been removed. (2) A graven dry dock is dug into the land. The vessel floats in but rests on land once the water has been pumped out. (3) Finally there is the marine railway, on which the vessel is drawn out of the water, instead of the water being drawn away from the vessel. A ship is no more and no less on land when it rests in a graven dry dock than when it rests on a marine railway. The three types of dry docks are not different in kind; functionally they are the same. And I see no basis for concluding that Congress treated one differently from the others for the purposes of this Act.
Mr. Justice Burton concurs in the affirmance of the judgment of the Court of Appeals but does so on the ground relied upon by that court and by the District Court. This was that the Deputy Commissioner, in making the award, acted within the terms of the Longshoremen’s and Harbor Workers’ Compensation Act, 44 Stat. 1426, 33 U. S.

  Opinion of the Court by

  announced by Mr. Justice Reed.
 

  The petitioner Howell Chevrolet Company retails Chevrolet automobiles and parts in Glendale, California.

  v.
  
   Bill Daniels, Inc.,
  
  202 F. 2d 579. We granted certiorari to consider the single question presented by petitioner — whether the Act is applicable to retail automobile dealers like Howell. 345 U. S. 955.
 

  Sections 10 (a) and 2 (7) of the Labor Act empower the Board to prevent “any person” from adversely “affecting commerce” by unfair labor practices “tending to lead to a labor dispute burdening or obstructing commerce or the free flow of commerce.” The Board found that Howell’s unfair labor practices tended to do this. Among others, the following facts underlie that finding:
 

  Howell bought its new Chevrolets from a General Motors assembly plant located in California and its spare parts and accessories were delivered to it from General Motors warehouses in California. Forty-three percent of all this merchandise was manufactured in other states and shipped into California for assembly or distribution. During 1949 Howell’s purchases from General Motors exceeded $1,000,000.
 

  Howell’s local retail establishment was closely supervised by General Motors. Sweeping control of the business was reserved by General Motors in a “Direct Dealer Selling Agreement.” Howell had to sign this agreement to get his “non-exclusive privilege of selling new Chevrolet motor vehicles and chassis” and “parts and accessories.” The agreement required Howell to make varied and detailed reports about his business affairs, to devote full time to Chevrolet sales, to keep his sales facilities at a location and conduct the business in a manner that satisfied General Motors, to permit General Motors to inspect Howell’s books, accounts, facilities, stocks and accessories and to keep such uniform accounting systems as General Motors might prescribe. Many other terms of the agency agreement also emphasized the interdependence of Howell’s local and General Motors’ national activities.
 

 
   *484
   
  All this evidence caused the Board to conclude that Howell was “an integral part” of General Motors’ national system of distribution. Under these circumstances the Board was justified in finding that Howell’s repeated unfair labor practices tended to lead to disputes burdening or obstructing commerce among the states. It follows that the Board had jurisdiction to act under the facts it found.

It also provided that the board could seek injunction against all types of fair labor practices and would also seek relief in cases where strikes or boycotts were defined as unfair labour practices. This distinction between public rights and private rights is discussed further in this paper. Public rights are those declared by the state as ""party either in criminal nor civil proceedings"" while private rights are ones asserted under the laws of the state. Private rights can be described as being those asserting by the states as ""a party eitherin criminal or civil proceeding."" In other words, these terms refer to different kinds of legal rights. For example: shippers' right to transport goods at reasonable prices is protected by the common law. However, interstate commerce acts do not protect private rights. If Congress were protecting only public interests, the same cannot be said of both the state and Federal authorities. Even if Congress were protective of a publicly or private interest, they will still have powers to intervene on private issues.",1954-01-04,2.0

I think the railroad has a right to have its case tried in the United States District Court. Congress has given such courts power to try any case that is (1) a “civil” action, (2) between “Citizens of different States,” (3) a “controversy,” and (4) involves a matter which “exceeds the sum or value of $3,000 exclusive of interest and costs.” *58328 U. S. C. § 1332. If a complaint alleges these four things a district court has jurisdiction. Here the railroad’s complaint shows all four. The case is plainly a “civil” action, not a criminal one. The railroad is a “citizen” of Delaware and the other parties are “citizens” of Iowa. There is a “controversy” about transferring title to property and how much the railroad must pay for it. And the dispute concerns more than $3,000 — the owners want $23,888.60, the railroad is willing to pay only $10,000. The foregoing allegations were sufficient to establish and did establish district court jurisdiction. Other facts were also alleged. If these facts were relevant to nonjurisdictional issues they were properly alleged; if immaterial they could have been stricken. In any event, a court cannot lose its power to act merely because of unnecessary words. A point is made of the railroad’s reference to certain prior state proceedings as though it had a right to “appeal” to the federal court from these proceedings. But assuming that the railroad confidently believed it had a right to appeal from the state commission, and therefore put a wrong label on its civil action, the District Court was still under a duty to try the case. After all, the railroad simply asked the court to fix damages for the property taken at “not to exceed $10,000,” and for “such further relief as may be just and proper under the circumstances.” And the pendency of a similar condemnation proceeding in the state court certainly did not destroy the federal court’s jurisdiction. Nor did the District Court lose its jurisdiction because the railroad failed to invoke Rule 71A or to observe its procedure. In trying the case, the court should of course require observance of the Rule, if applicable, but failure of the railroad to comply with it is no sufficient reason for the court’s refusal to settle the controversy. All of the alleged procedural mistakes attributed to the railroad could easily have been cured; *584none could possibly justify a final, unconditional dismissal of its cause of action. See Bell v.

A truck driver named Frank Boston has been charged by the company as an employee of the International Brotherhood Of Teamsters. The General counsel of the National labor Relations Board issues a complaint alleging that the company violated tenure or condition of work by refusing two occasions to hire Fowler; the company refuses to clear him without any proper clearance. The court finds that the Company did not want to employ Fofler because the union security clause was preferentially hiring for members who were in good standing. The company does not believe its refusal to clearing Fower was merely proof of views concerning breaking its rules.

The case concerns a collective bargaining agreement wherein the company allows non-union workers to work until they are employed by the union at the same time. The contract permits the company to use the union's exclusive bargaining agency to negotiate new contracts. The companies do not wish to make similar payments to any of their non-member employees on the bases that the employers will not be bound to do them.

Mr. Justice Reed,
dissenting.
I dissent. It should be noted that the New York statute, note 1 of the Court’s opinion, limits the use of the words “saving” or “savings” in relation to their banking business to certain types of New York financial institutions. These are those that are mutual in character as distinguished from stockholder-owned. Such mutual institutions can and do pay larger returns on deposits in New York than the commercial stock-type banks, state or national, both of which are barred by the New York statute from using the word “savings” “in relation to banking or financial business.” The mutual banks have been successful in attracting a large proportion of savings deposits for over a century. They have a remarkable record for soundness in finance and profitable operation for the benefit of the depositors. The purpose of the New York law is to reserve the use of the word “savings” to identify the mutual type of bank operation for the public, just as the federal banking laws reserve the name “national” for a certain type of bank organized under federal law.
The Court’s opinion permits the national banks to trade upon the good name of the savings banks to secure de*380posits of that type. Now they may advertise “A Savings Bank” under their corporate name; their deposit slips may say “Savings Account.” As no federal statute expressly authorizes the national banks to use the words “saving” or “savings” in their advertisements, I think they must conform to the New York law for the protection of the public from misunderstanding. I would not imply a federal privilege to use “savings” in advertising from the fact that national banks may accept savings deposits. The cases cited by the Court in note 7 sustain that view. I know of no precedents that approve such a limitation on state power as the Court now announces.

The court also considers whether Louisiana may be able to amend the terms of an existing contract in order to increase the obligations of another state's insurance company. This case arises from a contract between employers' liability assurance corporation, British corporations, and Toni Company; the contract stipulates that no action will lie against the employer until the insured has fulfilled all the terms on the contract. Both states have expressed their own state policy regarding the protection of funds provided by the No-Action clause. However, both states share concerns for the interests of the insured as well as the interest of other parties involved in the lawsuit. To resolve these conflicts solely on principle of equal relevance, Hamilton concludes that there are only two principles involved: 1) one principle must be satisfied at all times; and 2) each state must treat the contract differently from the maker of the contract itself. For example, a Mississippi law enforcement bond was invalid because it contained a condition that claims could be made within fifteen months after the employee's dismissal.

Respondent was indicted for violating §§3116 and 3115 of the Internal Revenue Code by having in his possession sugar, wooden barrels, a metal cap, a heater box and mash pipe, all “intended for use” in unlawfully evading liquor taxes. The District Court dismissed the indictment for failure to charge a crime. I agree. The indictment did clearly charge a violation of § 3116 which makes it “unlawful” to hold property for such an intended use. But § 3116 does not make “unlawful” possession a crime; the only sanction it contains is forfeiture. This *387Court nevertheless holds that possession for such an “unlawful” purpose is made a crime by §3115 (b). That section does not of itself define a crime; it merely authorizes fine or imprisonment for violations of other provisions of the Act which do not themselves prescribe a “special penalty.” Hence the general penalties of § 3115 cannot apply to violations of § 3116, because this latter section prescribes its own “special penalty” — seizure and forfeiture of property. This forfeiture is plainly a penalty since there is no practical difference between taking a man’s property by forfeiture and taking his money by a fine. And where Congress has specifically provided a property penalty I cannot agree to add a money penalty by dubious implication.
The accepted practice of construing criminal statutes narrowly should be especially appropriate here because of the unusual nature of the “crime” involved. The Court’s interpretation of § 3115 makes possession of innocent property, such as an automobile, a crime if the possessor intends to use it illegally, even if he has not done so. Guilt is made to depend wholly on what is within the defendant’s mind. Congress may well have been unwilling to apply sanctions other than forfeiture to an unexpressed intention to do something that has not even been attempted.

One such law was passed in Massachusetts, which required an individual to purchase liability insurance for himself and those who might injure him. This law did not prohibit states from protecting seamen; rather, it allowed them to buy insurance without paying out any money. The majority of the court believes that the limited liability act will give ship owners far more than congress intended. They argue that since the Act only requires ships to pay back what they paid on accident claims, there is no way that the ship owner could be forced to pay out too much.",1954-04-12,1.0

Mr. Justice Black,

Petitioner has lived in this country thirty-six years, having come here from Mexico in 1918 when only seven years of age. He has an American wife to whom he has been married for twenty years, four children all born here, and a stepson who served this country as a paratrooper. Since 1940 petitioner has been a laborer at the Van Camp Sea Food Company in San Diego, California. In 1944 petitioner became a member of the Communist Party. Deciding that he no longer wanted to belong to that party, he got out sometime around 1946 or 1947. As pointed out in the Court’s opinion, during the period of his membership the Communist Party functioned “as a distinct and active political organization.” See Communist Party v. Peek, 20 Cal. 2d 536, 127 P. 2d 889. Party candidates appeared on California election ballots, and no federal law then frowned on Communist Party political activities. Now in 1954, however, petitioner is to be deported from this country solely because of his past lawful membership in that party. And this is to be done without proof or finding that petitioner knew that the party had any evil purposes or that he agreed *533with any such purposes that it might have had. On the contrary, there is strong evidence that he was a good, law-abiding man, a steady worker and a devoted husband and father loyal to this country and its form of government.
For joining a lawful political group years ago — an act which he had no possible reason to believe would subject him to the slightest penalty — petitioner now loses his job, his friends, his home, and maybe even his children, who must choose between their father and their native country. Perhaps a legislative act penalizing political activities legal when engaged in is not a bill of attainder. But see United States v. Lovett, 328 U. S. 303, 315-316. Conceivably an Act prescribing exile for prior innocent conduct does not violate the constitutional prohibition of ex post facto laws. Cf. American Communications Assn., v. Douds, 339 U. S. 382, 412-415. It may be possible that this deportation order for engaging in political activities does not violate the First Amendment’s clear ban against abridgment of political speech and assembly. Maybe it is not even a denial of due process and equal protection of the laws. But see dissenting opinions in Carlson v. Landon, 342 U. S. 524, and Harisiades v. Shaughnessy, 342 U. S. 580. I am unwilling to say, however, that despite these constitutional safeguards this man may be driven from our land because he joined a political party that California and the Nation then recognized as perfectly legal.

Mr. Justice Douglas,

As Mr. Justice Black states in his dissent, the only charge against this alien is an act that was lawful when done. I agree that there is, therefore, no constitutional basis for deportation, if aliens, as well as citizens, are to be the beneficiaries of due process of law.
*534The case might, of course, be different if the past affiliation with Communism now seized upon as the basis for deportation had continued down to this date. But so far as this record shows, the alien Galvan quit the Communist Party at least six years ago. There is not a word in the present record to show that he continued his affiliations with it sub rosa or espoused its causes or joined in any of its activities since he ceased to be a member of it.
I cannot agree that because a man was once a Communist, he always must carry the curse. Experience teaches otherwise. It is common knowledge that though some of the leading Socialists of Asia once were Communists, they repudiated the Marxist creed when they experienced its ugly operations, and today are the most effective opponents the Communists know. So far as the present record shows, Galvan may be such a man. Or he may be merely one who transgressed and then returned to a more orthodox political faith. The record is wholly silent about Galvan’s present political activities. Only one thing is clear: Galvan is not being punished for what he presently is, nor for an unlawful act, nor for espionage or conspiracy or intrigue against this country. He is being punished for what he once was, for a political faith he briefly expressed over six years ago and then rejected.
This action is hostile to our constitutional standards, as I pointed out in Harisiades v. Shaughessy, 342 U. S. 580, 598. Aliens who live here in peace, who do not abuse our hospitality, who are law-abiding members of our communities, have the right to due process of law. They too are “persons” within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment. They can be molested by the Government in times of peace only when their presence here is hostile to the safety or welfare of the Nation. If they are to be deported, it must be for what they are and do, not for what they once believed.

Braniff Airways, in challenging the power of Nebraska to lay this ad valorem tax, claims only that its planes have no taxable situs in the State. It does not claim that no fraction of the aircraft, on an apportioned basis, *603is permanently in the State. Nor does it attack this ■ apportionment formula.
My understanding of our decisions is that the power to lay an ad valorem tax turns on the permanency of the property in the State. All the property may be there or only a fraction of it. Property in transit, whether a plane discharging passengers or an automobile refueling, is not subject to an ad valorem tax. Property in transit may move so regularly and so continuously that part of it is always in the State. Then the fraction, but no more, may be taxed ad valorem.
I mention these elemental points to reserve explicitly the validity of the apportionment formula that serves as the basis of this ad valorem tax. The formula used presents substantial questions. What might be an adequate formula for a gross receipts tax might be inadequate for an ad valorem tax. Moreover, when we are faced with a due process question, we have a problem we may not delegate to Congress.
I do not think the Court takes a position contrary to what I have said.

In Brooks v. United States, 337 U.

But we pointed out that the accident there had nothing to do with the “army careers” of the soldiers and was neither caused by nor incident to their military service. When injured the two soldiers were off duty and were riding along a state highway in their own car on their own business which bore no relationship of any kind to any past, present or future connection with the army. Thus, the two soldiers would have been injured had they never worn a uniform at all. In this case, however, the injury is inseparably related to military service and the Brooks case should not be held controlling. But for his army service this veteran could not have been injured in the veterans hospital as he was eligible and admitted for treatment there solely because of war service which gave him veteran status. Moreover, he was actually being treated for an army service injury.
For a hospital injury a veteran is entitled to precisely the same disability benefits as if the injury had been inflicted while he was a soldier.* We have previously held, I think correctly, that a soldier injured in a hospital cannot also sue for damages under the Tort Claims Act. Feres v. United States, 340 U. S. 135. But the Court now holds that a veteran can. To permit a veteran to recover damages from the Government in circumstances under which a soldier on active duty cannot recover seems like an unjustifiable discrimination which the Act does not require.

 “Where any veteran suffers ... an injury, or an aggravation of any existing injury, as the result of hospitalization or medical or surgical treatment . . . benefits . . . shall be awarded in the same manner as if such disability, aggravation, or death were service connected . . . .” 48 Stat. 526, 38 U.

dissenting.
I think the District Court’s order denying a stay is appealable because it is (1) “final” within the meaning of 28 U. S. C. § 1291 and (2) a refusal to grant an interlocutory injunction within the meaning of § 1292. As the Court admits, a collateral issue may be so severable and unrelated to central trial issues that a judgment on the collateral issue is considered “final” and appealable under § 1291, even though other important issues are left undecided. Given this common sense meaning § 1291 authorizes the present appeal. For certainly decision of whether a judicial rather than an arbitration tribunal shall hear and determine this accounting controversy is logically and practically severable from the factual and legal issues crucial to determination of the merits of the controversy. And this Court has held that § 1292 makes all stay orders appealable that have the substantial effect of interlocutory injunction orders. Ettelson v. Metropoli*186tan Ins. Co., 317 U. S. 188. The refusal to stay here had that effect. Indeed, the Court seems to admit that this order refusing a stay would be appealable had it been entered by another judge not presiding in this particular case. I agree with the Court that this jurisdictional “incongruity . . . springs from the persistence of outmoded procedural differentiations” that have “elements of fiction” in this modern day. I do not agree that the Court’s obeisance to these incongruous fictions is required by congressional enactments.
The Court relies on a purpose of Congress to avoid a waste of time and money incident to repeated “piecemeal” appeals in the same suit. But, as pointed out, Congress, in §§ 1291 and 1292, has left the way open for the appeal of many judgments finally deciding collateral and sever-able issues separately adjudicated in a case. Any rigid rule to the contrary would itself guarantee useless delays and expenses. For two trials, one unnecessary, may take longer and cost more than two appeals where one would do. Take this case for example. It must now go back for a court accounting trial which could be time-consuming and expensive to litigants and to the Government. And should petitioner lose on the merits it could undoubtedly appeal. On that review the first question for the appellate court would be whether the order denying arbitration, which the Court now refuses to consider, was right or wrong. If found wrong, the trial court’s judgment on the merits would have to be vacated and the case again sent back for determination on the merits — this time by arbitration. In that event the trial the Court now orders will have been wholly futile — not even the litigant who now appears to be successful will have gained anything from it, unless perchance he stands to profit from delay. There is some difficulty, at least, in laying this wasteful procedure at the door of Congress.

Mr. Justice Frankfurter,

dissenting.
Fully aware of the complicated interrelations of holding-company systems, Congress did not enact a scheme for severance of all intercorporate relations among public utility interests. Instead, specific provisions were devised against specific abuses and the Securities and Exchange Commission was given specific authority to effectuate the defined functions of these different provisions. Enforcement of the Act- entailed authorization by the Commission of reorganization to secure simplification of a holding-company system a!nd regulation of transactions involving acquisitions and dispositions. Duly mindful of the abuses of excessive fees in the conduct of inter-company affairs, Congress effectively equipped the Commission with power to regulate fees in the various proceedings which required approval by the Commission. But Congress particularized. It did not vest this fee-fixing authority of the Commission in a comprehensive provision. It dealt with the problem distributively. It was *350explicit in relating the power to fix fees to the particular proceeding.
The matter before us relates to the fixing of fees in a proceeding under § 11 of the Holding Company Act. That was a proceeding for the reorganization of Electric, a subsidiary of Bond and Share. That section gave the Commission full power to fix fees to be paid by Electric as a condition to approval of its plan for reorganization. To be sure, Electric’s plan involved the parent, Bond and Share, and the confirmation of Electric’s plan required approval by the Commission of “acquisition” by Bond and Share of new securities. That approval under § 10 subjected the fees which Bond and Share could pay Drexel to the scrutiny and approval of the Commission. The consummation of Electric's plan likewise involved a “sale” by Bond and Share under § 12. Again, that section made Bond and Share’s payment of fees to Drexel subject to the Commission’s approval. The Commission gave the required approval to the “acquisition” and “sale” under §§10 and 12, respectively, without passing on the fee payable by Bond and Share or reserving the question of the propriety of such fees. The reservation regarding fees in the proceedings of Electric was applicable to the fees in connection with Electric’s plan under § 11, and cannot be made to supply the failure to fix or to reserve the matter of fees in the proceedings under §§10 and 12 in relation to which they were incurred.
The Holding Company Act of 1935 is a reticulated -statute, not a hodge-podge. To observe its explicit provisions is to respect the purpose of Congress and the care with which it was formulated.

The courts held that these interests were not subject to the tax; they were simply the measures taken against the bank when collecting the taxes. The Ohio Supreme Court decided that the tax did not constitute a privilege tax nor a franchise-tax. It was determined that the interest of the bankers would be treated as separate property interests from the company's ownership. This result was further supported by Van Allen, National Bank, Commonwealth, and Des Moines national bank cases. The only exception to this rule of immunity lies in the doctrine that states may levy taxes on the stocks owned by the corporations without any deduction on the United States securities being held by the companies. Thus, even though the legislature intended to tax the banks' own interests, the laws do not allow them to pay back the tax at all.",1955-05-16,1.0

However, when the question of whether he or Emspak knew about Joseph Persly is asked, the witness does not tell the committee that he has been involved in the political activity of the organization. The case concludes that both petitioners are entitled to the privilege against personal incriminating behavior. The Court determines that neither Petitioner nor Emspeak informed the Committee of his intention either to accept the claims or to ask whether a person was in fact answering the questions. The purpose with the witnesses is to provide proper interrogations, subject to objected for materiality; or use ofcoercion, which may reasonably be suspected from compel disclosures. Although the Congress wrote an ""exception"" to this duty as a way to excuse the innocent and guilty alike from testingify in criminal cases, there is nothing at all wrong with the testimony of these three witnesses.

Mr. Justice Black,

I would prefer to decide this case on the constitutional questions discussed by Mr. Justice Douglas or on some of the other constitutional questions necessarily involved. See United States v. Lovett, 328 U. S. 303. See my dissents in Dennis v. United States, 341 U. S. 494, 579-581; Communications Assn. v. Douds, 339 U. S. 382, 445-453. See also my concurring opinion in Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee v. McGrath, 341 U. S. 123, 142-149. I agree that it is generally better for this Court not to decide constitutional questions in cases which can be adequately disposed of on non-constitutional grounds. See Charles River Bridge v. Warren Bridge, 11 Pet. 420, 553. But this generally accepted practice should not be treated as though it were an inflexible rule to be inexorably followed under all circumstances. See Youngstown Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U. S. 579, 584-585. Here, as in the Youngstown case, I think it would be better judicial practice to reach and decide the constitutional issues, although I agree with the Court that the Presidential Order can justifiably be construed *350as denying the Loyalty Review Board the power exercised in this case. For this reason I join the opinion of the Court. But I wish it distinctly understood that I have grave doubt as to whether the Presidential Order has been authorized by any Act of Congress. That order and others associated with it embody a broad, far-reaching espionage program over government employees. These orders look more like legislation to me than properly authorized regulations to carry out a clear and explicit command of Congress. I also doubt that the Congress could delegate power to do what the President has attempted to do in the Executive Order under consideration here. And of course the Constitution does not confer lawmaking power on the President. Youngstown Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U. S. 579.
I have thought it necessary to add these statements to the Court’s opinion in order that the President’s power to issue the order might not be considered as having been decided sub silentio.

Mr. Justice Minton,
whom Mr. Justice Burton joins,
dissenting.
I agree with the opinion of Mr. Justice Reed, and I would add another reason why I think the judgment should be affirmed.
A civilian not under the jurisdiction of the Military Code has a right to be tried in a civil court for an alleged crime as a civilian. My trouble is that I don’t think Toth was a full-fledged civilian. By 50 U. S. C. § 553, Congress had retained jurisdiction to try Toth for a crime he had committed while a soldier and for which admittedly he could have been tried by court-martial if the United States had discovered his crime one minute before discharge.
He was not a full-fledged civilian under his discharge. He was still a soldier to answer in court-martial for the crime he had committed while a soldiér. He had a conditional discharge only. The United States clearly reserved the right to charge and try him by court-martial for a crime committed while in the status of a soldier. This is the way Congress had provided for his trial. No other way was provided. That it may have provided another way is not to say the way provided is invalid.
I know of no reason why Congress could not pass this statute, 50 U. S. C. § 553, retaining court-martial jurisdiction over Toth to answer for a crime he allegedly committed when he was clearly subject to court-martial. Kahn v. Anderson, 255 U. S. 1, holds that, even though discharged from service, one convicted and serving sentence for a military offense could still be tried by court-*45martial for murder and conspiracy to commit murder, even though the crime was alleged to have been committed within the limits of a state. Congress had made no provision for retention of status, in that case as it had in this case, yet the Court implied the continuing military status to warrant the jurisdiction. No implied status is necessary here. It is expressly reserved by statute. Toth remained in that status by virtue of the statute.

  We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals without reaching the constitutional challenge to that court’s jurisdiction to review the denial by the trial court of a motion for a new trial on the ground that the verdict was excessive. Even assuming such appellate power to exist under the Seventh Amendment, we find that the Court of Appeals was not justified, on this record, in regarding the denial of a new trial, upon a remittitur of part of the verdict, as an abuse of discretion. For apart from that question, as we view the evidence we think that the action of the trial court was not without support in the record, and accordingly that its action should not have been disturbed by the Court of Appeals.

While I agree with the result reached by the Court, I do not think this case is comparable to those controversies that frequently rage over the scope of the investigative power in support of administrative action. Cf. Cudahy Packing Co. v. Holland, 315 U. S. 357, with United States v. Morton Salt Co., 338 U. S. 632. Congress has provided a special judicial procedure which must be followed, if a citizen is denaturalized. That procedure is contained in § 340 of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952. 66 Stat. 163, 8 U. S. C. § 1451. It provides for canceling a certificate of naturalization on the ground that it was procured “by concealment of a material fact or by willful misrepresentation.” §340 (a). Suit may be brought by the United States Attorney in the District Court “upon affidavit showing good cause.” Id. The citizen whose citizenship is challenged has 60 days “in which to make answer to the petition of the United States.” § 340 (b). There is no pretrial administrative procedure provided in the section governing denaturalization. One can search § 340 in vain for any suggestion that the judicial procedure is supplemented by a pretrial procedure. So to hold would make the 60-day period for answer “empty words,” as Judge Foley ruled in Application of Barnes, 116 F. Supp. 464, 469. As Judge Hastie, writing for the court below in the Minker case, said, the administrative pretrial procedure is not consistent with the safeguards which Congress has provided in the judicial proceedings. 217 F. 2d 350, 352. I agree with that view and would, therefore, read *197§ 235 (a) to exclude witnesses who are potential defendants in § 340 cases.
There is another reason for reading the section narrowly. When we deal with citizenship we tread on sensitive ground. The citizenship of a naturalized person has the same dignity and status as the citizenship of those of us born here, save only for eligibility to the Presidency. He is a member of a community included within the protection of all the guarantees of the Constitution. Those safeguards would be imperiled if prior to the institution of the proceedings the citizen could be compelled to be a witness against himself and furnish out of his own mouth the evidence used to denaturalize him. I would require the Government to proceed with meticulous regard for the basic notions of Due Process which protect every vital right of the American citizen.

This section makes certain that when a dispute arises out of a specific contract, the parties will be able to seek binding arbitration under the terms of such contract.

The appealed party seeks a stay of the case until the matter is resolved at an appropriate time.

The question is whether these notes are ""debentures"" or ""certifications of indebritedness."" The Court decides that they are not taxable under the 1801 tax treaty because they do not have the same features as other instruments: each instrument has a maturity period of 15 years, eachcarries interest of 3.3% per year, and each is subject to an underlying contract containing elaborate terms for the protectionof the noteholders. The government contends that this distinction between bonds, dentures, and certificate of indemnity does not apply to any particular type of note; however, the legislative distinction between them assumes significance when determining whether such notes are deemed taxable. In fact, the earlier legislation did not explicitly define the term ""promissories notes,"" but rather simply defined it as ""ordinary short-term papers customarilyused in day-Today commercial transactions."" Thus, the only difference between the promissery note provisions and the general form of the statute is that the latter applies only to marketably issued corporate securities. The General Motors Case, which was decided in 1921, states that all instruments with the required features are considered ""bonds, debtes, or notes."" However, since 1920, the Treasury has treated instruments having the character of investment security as ""distinguished from instruments earing debts  arise in ordinary transaction among individuals.""

The Motor Carrier Act, 49 Stat. 543, 544, 49 U. S. C. § 303 (a) (14), gives to the term “common carrier by motor vehicle” the classic meaning that “common carrier” had acquired and maintained during the course of centuries. In short, the test of what is a “common carrier” under this Act is what legal history has established as the test, and we do not find that the Interstate Commerce Commission has departed from this test. We cannot believe that if the evidence, as disclosed by the record, which need not be recited, had appeared in a common-law action against the respondent, a court would be justified in taking the case from the jury, and that if the jury had found against the respondent, its verdict would not be allowed to stand. The finding by the Interstate Commerce Commission that the respondent was a “common carrier,” and therefore subject to the regulatory provisions of the Act, ought not to have less weight than a jury’s verdict. Accordingly, other issues raised in the case are not reached, and we would reverse the judgment below.

The Government has no right to a direct appeal to this . Court under 18 U. S.

The presence of any additional and independent ground for the District Court’s order is fatal to direct review here. I am convinced that there is such an independent ground for the District Court’s judgment in this case. It is evident from the district judge’s memorandum opinion (135 F. Supp. 162) that his order granting the motions in arrest of judgment rested at least in part upon the insufficiency of the evidence to support the conviction. He considered facts not alleged in the indictment, e. g., that contractors in the community had customarily agreed to the employment of labor which allegedly was demanded by appellees, and that the trouble on the particular job was caused by a disagreement between the contractor and labor, not by an attempt to extort. I would therefore dismiss the Government’s appeal.

There are instances where we have sustained identical regulations of the same act by both a State and the Federal Government. California v. Zook, 336 U. S. 725, is an example. But the instances are few and far between.
Of course, where the States and the Federal Government regulate the same act, but each with a different sanction, both often survive. United Workers v. Laburnum Corp., 347 U. S. 656, is a recent example. We there allowed a common-law tort action for damages to be enforced in a state court for the same acts that could have been the basis for administrative relief under the federal Act. But the present case is not that case. Here the State has prescribed an administrative remedy that duplicates the administrative remedy prescribed by Congress. Each reaches the same identical conduct. We disallowed that duplication of remedy in Garner v. Teamsters Union, 346 U. S. 485. In that case we held that a state court could not enjoin action which was subject to an unfair labor proceeding under the federal Act. And see Weber v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc., 348 U. S. 468. Today we depart from Garner and allow a state board to enjoin action *276which is subject to an unfair labor proceeding before the federal board. We sanction a precise duplication of remedies which is pregnant with potentialities of clashes and conflicts.*
Of course the States may control violence. They may make arrests and invoke their criminal law to the hilt. They transgress only when they allow their administrative agencies or their courts to enjoin the conduct that Congress has authorized the federal agency to enjoin. We retreat from Garner and open the door to unseemly conflicts between state and federal agencies when we sustain what Wisconsin has done here.

Allen-Bradley Local v. Wisconsin Board, 315 U. S. 740, is not in point because the federal Act at that time made no provision for enjoining union activities.

*413Me. Justice Frankfurter,
concurring.
I concur in the judgment of the Court and in so much of Mr. Justice Reed's opinion as supports the conclusion that cellophane did not by itself constitute a closed market but was a part of the relevant market for flexible packaging materials.
Mr. Justice Reed has pithily defined the conflicting claims in this case. “The charge was monopolization of cellophane. The defense, that cellophane was merely a part of the relevant market for flexible packaging materials.” Since this defense is sustained, the judgment below must be affirmed and it becomes unnecessary to consider whether du Pont’s power over trade in cellophane would, had the defense failed, come within the prohibition of “monopolizing” under § 2 of the Sherman Act. Needless disquisition on the difficult subject of single-firm monopoly should be avoided since the case may be disposed of without consideration of this problem.
The boundary between the course of events by which a business may reach a powerful position in an industry without offending the outlawry of “monopolizing” under i 2 of the Sherman Act and the course of events which brings the attainment of that result within the condemnation of that section, cannot be established by general phrases. It must be determined with reference to specific facts upon considerations analogous to those by which § 1 of the Sherman Act is applied. These were illuminatingly stated by Mr. Justice Brandéis for the Court:
“The true test of legality is whether the restraint imposed is such as merely regulates and perhaps thereby promotes competition or whether it is such as may suppress or even destroy competition. To determine that question the court must ordinarily consider the facts peculiar to the business to which *414the restraint is applied; its condition before and after the restraint was imposed; the nature of the restraint and its effect, actual or probable. The history of the restraint, the evil believed to exist, the reason for adopting the particular remedy, the purpose or end sought to be attained, are all relevant facts. . . Board of Trade of the City of Chicago v. United States, 246 U. S. 231, 238.
Sections 1 and 2 of course implicate different considerations. But the so-called issues of fact and law that call for adjudication in this legal territory are united, and intrinsically so, with factors that entail social and economic judgment. Any consideration of “monopoly” under the Sherman law can hardly escape judgment, even if only implied, on social and economic issues. It had best be withheld until a case inescapably calls for it.

The plaintiffs are Mackey's original plaintiffs, Searses, Roe Buck & Company, and Time-Saver tools. They have brought multiple claims against Mackey as well as several other lawsuits.

It was believed that such a verdict would leave the entire case unadjicated. However, the Supreme Court adopted a new version of Rule 54, which states that when more than oneclaim for relief can be presented in an actions, the courts may enter judicial judgment upon oneor more but lessthan all ofthe claims.

We believe that the “federal law merchant,"" which Clearfield Trust Co. v. United States, 318 U. S. 363, 367, held applicable to transactions in the commercial paper of the United States, should be applicable to all transactions in that paper. Indeed the Court said in National Metropolitan Bank v. United States, 323 U. S. 454, 456, that “legal questions involved in controversies over such commercial papers are to be resolved by the application of federal rather than local law.” Not until today has a distinction been drawn between suits by the United States on that paper and suits by other parties to it. But the Court does not stop there. Because this is “essentially a private transaction,” it is to be governed by local law. Yet the nature of the rights and obligations created by commercial paper of the United States Government is said to be controlled by federal law. Thus, federal law is to govern some portion of a dispute between private parties, while that portion of the dispute which is “essentially of local concern” is to be governed by local law. The uncertainties which inhere in such a dichotomy are obvious. Cf. Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen, 244 U. S. 205; Davis v. Department of Labor, 317 U. S. 249.
The virtue of a uniform law governing bonds, notes, and other paper issued by the United States is that it provides a certain and definite guide to the rights of all parties rather than subjecting them to the vagaries of the laws of many States. The business of the United States will go on without that uniformity. But the policy surrounding our choice of law is concerned with the convenience, certainty, and definiteness in having one set of rules governing the rights of all parties to government paper, as contrasted to multiple rules. If the rule of the Clearfield Trust case is to be abandoned as to some parties, it should be abandoned as to all and we should start afresh on this problem.

If the issue in this case is the constitutionality of the statutory provision made for taking the property, its constitutionality seems clear. If, as I assume to be the case, the issue is the constitutional sufficiency of the statutory ten-day notice by publication of the hearing to assess the compensation for the land taken, I consider such a provision to be within the constitutional discretion of the lawmaking body of the State.
In weighing the “due process” of condemnation procedure some reasonable balance must be struck between the needs of the public to acquire the property, and the opportunity for a hearing as to the compensation to be paid for the property. Just compensation is constitutionally necessary, but the length and kind of notice of the proceeding to determine such compensation is largely a matter of legislative discretion. The minimum notice required by this statute may seem to some to be inadequate or undesirably short, but it was satisfactory to the lawmakers of Kansas. It also has been upheld by the Supreme Court of Kansas and the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. To proscribe it as viola-tive of the Federal Constitution fails to allow adequate scope to local legislative discretion. Accordingly, while not passing upon the desirability of the statutory require*127ment before us, I am not ready to hold that the Constitution of the United States prohibits the people of Kansas from choosing that standard. Particularly, I am not ready to throw a nationwide cloud of uncertainty upon the validity of condemnation proceedings based on compliance with similar local statutes. Since 1889, it has been settled that notice by publication in condemnation proceedings to take and to fix the value to be paid for the land of a nonresident comports with due process. Huling v.

I agree that decompliance of the union is not a sanction authorized by § 9 (h). But this case presents another consideration that cannot be overlooked in the due administration of justice and that, standing alone, would lead me to reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals. As stated below in the dissenting opinion of Judge Stewart:
“A court of competent jurisdiction has found that Gold’s affidavit of August 30, 1950, was false. The critical date as to compliance with § 9 (h) of the National Labor Relations Act as amended was the date of issuance of the Board’s complaint. N. L. R. B. v. Dant, 344 U. S. 375 .... If the complaint had issued during the twelve month period while this false affidavit was in effect, the question before us would be clear cut. That, however, is not the case.
*157“In August of 1951 Gold filed a new non-Communist affidavit, and it was during the effective period of that affidavit that the complaint in this case issued. No court has found that affidavit to be false. It is true that the Board found in 1954 that the Union was not at that time in compliance with § 9 (h). Assuming the Board had power to make such a finding, and assuming further that it be considered a finding that the 1951 affidavit was false, it must, I should think, be supported, like any Board finding, by substantial evidence, considering the record as a whole. We have no such record before us. Indeed, it appears that the question of the truth or falsity of the 1951 affidavit has never been heard on the merits. [Footnote omitted.]
“A jury has found that in 1950 Gold was both a Communist and a liar, to put it bluntly.

In joining the Court’s opinion I should like to add a few words. A case like this is not easy for one who believes very strongly that adequate power should accompany the responsibility of the States for the enforcement of their criminal law. But the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment has placed limitations upon the discretion, unbridled for all practical purposes, that belonged to the States prior to its adoption, and, more particularly, confines their freedom of action in devising criminal procedure. It is, I assume, common ground that if this record had disclosed an admission by the police of one truncheon blow on the head of petitioner a confession following such a blow would be inadmissible because of the Due Process Clause. For myself, I cannot see the difference, with respect to the “voluntariness” of a confession, between the subversion of freedom of the will through physical punishment and the sapping of the will appropriately to be inferred from the circumstances *199of this case — detention of the accused virtually incommunicado for a long period; failure to arraign him in that period; 1 horse-shedding of the accused at the intermittent pleasure of the police until confession was forthcoming. No single one of these circumstances alone would in my opinion justify a reversal. I cannot escape the conclusion, however, that in combination they bring the result below the Plimsoll line of “due process.”
A state court’s judgment of conviction must not be set aside by this Court where the practices of the prosecution, including the police as one of its agencies, do not offend what may fairly be deemed the civilized standards of the Anglo-American world.2 This record reveals a course of conduct that, however conscientiously pursued, clearly falls below those standards. Such conduct is not only not consonant with our professions about criminal justice, as against authoritarian methods that we denounce. It derives from an attitude that is mimical, if experience is any guide, to the most enduring interests of law.

 Flouting of the requirement of prompt arraignment prevailing in most States is in and of itself not a denial of due process. Cf. McNabb v. United States, 318 U. S. 332. But it is to disregard experience not to recognize that the ordinary motive for such extended failure to arraign is not unrelated to the purpose of extracting confessions.


 “Ours is the accusatorial as opposed to the inquisitorial system.” Watts v. Indiana, 338 U. S. 49, 54. An analysis of the particular phase of the judicial process involved in applying the Due Process Clause to state convictions secured on the basis of confessions has been attempted in my opinions in Malinski v. New York, 324 U. S. 401, 412; Haley v. Ohio, 332 U. S. 596, 601; Watts v. Indiana, supra.

However, the legislation did not explicitly require the government to pay back the premiums on policies lapsed.

Professor John Wigmore supported the bill but was opposed to it. The House Committee on Armed Affairs made a thorough report on the bill. It claimed that carrying such a burden would cost the government money but expressed hope that the burden would be small because ""in the first place...the Government only guarantee the payment of its premiums.""

  We granted certiorari in this case to review a judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, 229 F. 2d 232, reversing an order of the District Court for the Southern District of Illinois, sitting in bankruptcy, which required respondent as trustee of a bankrupt’s estate to pay $27,400 to petitioner. 351 U. S. 949. The District Court’s order was based on a finding that, subsequent to
   
   *281
   
  the date of the adjudication of bankruptcy, the bankrupt had obtained money by fraud from the petitioner and had turned over $27,400 of that money to respondent. At the hearing before the District Court, petitioner had sought to introduce into evidence an affidavit in which the bankrupt stated that he had paid $36,000 of the money he had received from petitioner to the respondent. At the conclusion of the hearing, the District Court sustained respondent’s motion to strike the affidavit.
 

  On appeal, the Court of Appeals held that petitioner had failed to prove that any specific portion of the money that he had given the bankrupt became a part of the funds in the hands of respondent. Because petitioner had not cross-appealed, the Court of Appeals held that it could not consider the action of the District Court in striking the bankrupt’s affidavit from the record.
 

  A successful party in the District Court may sustain its judgment on any ground that finds support in the record. If the District Court was in error in striking an admissible affidavit, a cross-appeal was not a prerequisite for the Court of Appeals to rule on the admissibility of the affidavit, and finding it admissible, to find that it afforded evidence in support of the District Court judgment.

In 1944 petitioner expanded its plant in an effort to increase the output of these essential war products. At the same time it applied to the War Production Board for certification that the various additions were necessary in the interest of national defense. However the Board, as in

  amortization of that part of the costs which had been certified by the Board.
 

  In 1951 the Commissioner of Internal Revenue asserted a deficiency against petitioner on grounds unrelated to the present controversy. Petitioner subsequently filed a petition for redetermination with the Tax Court claiming that it was entitled to a refund for overpayment of income taxes in 1944. The amount of this overpayment was calculated on the basis that petitioner was entitled to accelerate the amortization of the full cost of those facilities covered by the Board’s “partial certifications.” Petitioner contends that the Board was not authorized to certify only a part of the cost of a facility when the Board had determined that the facility as a whole was necessary to the national defense. The Tax Court granted petitioner’s claim, but on appeal the Second Circuit reversed, holding that petitioner had forfeited its right to challenge the Board’s action by waiting too long after accepting the tax benefits of the “partial certificates” to attack their validity. 230 F. 2d 161.

If Congress desires to make cheating, in all its myriad varieties, a federal offense when employed to obtain an automobile that is then taken across a state line, it should express itself with less ambiguity than by language that leads three Courts of Appeals to decide that it has not said so and three that it has. If “stealing” (describing a thing as “stolen”) be not a term of art, it must be deemed a colloquial, everyday term. As such, it would hardly be used, even loosely, by the man in the street to cover “cheating.” Legislative drafting is dependent on treacherous words to convey, as often as not, complicated ideas, and courts should not be pedantically exacting in con*418struing legislation. But to sweep into the jurisdiction of the federal courts the transportation of cars obtained not only by theft but also by trickery does not present a problem so complicated that the Court should search for hints to find a command. When Congress has wanted to deal with many different ways of despoiling another of his property and not merely with larceny, it has found it easy enough to do so, as a number of federal enactments attest. See, e. g., 18 U. S. C. §§ 641, 655, 659, 1707. No doubt, penal legislation should not be artificially restricted so as to allow escape for those for whom it was with fair intendment designed. But the principle of lenity which should guide construction of criminal statutes, Bell v. United States, 349 U. S. 81, 83-84, precludes extending the term “stolen” to include every form of dishonest acquisition. This conclusion is encouraged not only by the general consideration governing the construction of penal laws; it also has regard for not bringing to the federal courts a mass of minor offenses that are local in origin until Congress expresses, if not an explicit, at least an unequivocal, desire to do so.
I would affirm the judgment.

The Court seems to sanction in the name of law enforcement the assault made by the police on this unconscious man. If law enforcement were the chief value in our constitutional scheme, then due process would shrivel *443and become of little value in protecting the rights of the citizen. But those who fashioned the Constitution put certain rights out of the reach of the police and preferred other rights over law enforcement.
One source of protection of the citizen against state action is the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Our decisions hold that the police violate due process when they use brutal methods to obtain evidence against a man and use it to convict him. Rochin v. California, 342 U. S. 165; Chambers v. Florida, 309 U. S. 227. But the conception of due process is not limited to a prohibition of the use of force and violence against an accused. In Leyra v. Denno, 347 U. S. 556, we set aside a conviction where subtle, nonviolent methods had been used to exact a confession from a prisoner. For it was obvious that coercion might be the product of subtlety as well as of violence. We should take the same libertarian approach here.
As I understand today’s decision there would be a violation of due process if the blood had been withdrawn from the accused after a struggle with the police. But the sanctity of the person is equally violated and his body assaulted where the prisoner is incapable of offering resistance as it would be if force were used to overcome his resistance. In both cases evidence is used to convict a man which has been obtained from him on an involuntary basis. I would not draw a line between the use of force on the one hand and trickery, subterfuge, or any police technique which takes advantage of the inability of the prisoner to resist on the other. Nor would I draw a line between involuntary extraction of words from his lips, the involuntary extraction of the contents of his stomach, and the involuntary extraction of fluids of his body when the evidence obtained is used to convict him. Under our system of government, police cannot compel people to furnish the evidence necessary to send them to prison. *444Yet there is compulsion here, following the violation by the police of the sanctity of the body of an unconscious man.
And if the decencies of a civilized state are the test, it is repulsive to me for the police to insert needles into an unconscious person in order to get the evidence necessary to convict him, whether they find the person unconscious, give him a pill which puts him to sleep, or use force to subdue him. The indignity to the individual is the same in one case as in the other, for in each is his body invaded and assaulted by the police who are supposed to be the citizen’s protector.
I would reverse this judgment of conviction.

The difficult problem in this case derives for me not out of the Sherman Law but in relation to the appropriate compulsion of stare decisis. It does not derive from the Sherman Law because the most conscientious probing of the text and the interstices of the Sherman Law fails to disclose that Congress, whose will we are enforcing, excluded baseball — the conditions under which that sport is carried on — from the scope of the Sherman Law but included football. I say this, fully aware that the Sherman Law’s applicability turns on the particular circumstances of activities pursued in trade and commerce among the several States. But whether the conduct of an enterprise is within or without the limits of the Sherman Law is, after all, a question for judicial determination, and conscious as I am of my limited competence in matters athletic, I have yet to hear of any consideration that led this Court to hold that “the business of providing public baseball games for profit between clubs of professional baseball players was not within the scope of the federal antitrust laws,” Toolson v. New York Yankees, 346 U. S. 356, 357, that is not equally applicable to football.
But considerations pertaining to stare decisis do raise a serious question for me. That principle is a vital ingredient of law, for it “embodies an important social policy.” Helvering v. Hallock, 309 U. S. 106, 119. It would disregard the principle for a judge stubbornly to persist in his views on a particular issue after the contrary had become part of the tissue of the law. Until then, full respect for stare decisis does not require a judge to forego his own convictions promptly after his brethren have rejected them.
The considerations that governed me two years ago in United States v. International Boxing Club, 348 U. S. 236, *456have not lost their force by reason of the authority that time gives to a single decision. And so I am confronted with the Toolson case, supra, which guides me to find the present situation within its scope, and the Boxing case, supra, which, while it looks the other way, left Toolson as a living authority. Respect for the doctrine of stare decisis does not yet require me to disrespect the views I expressed in the Boxing case.

National League, 259 U. S. 200, and Toolson v. New York Yankees, Inc., 346 U. S. 356, do not control football by reason of stare decisis. Since I am unable to distinguish football from baseball under the rationale of Federal Baseball and Toolson, and can find no basis for attributing to Congress a purpose to put baseball in a class by itself, I would adhere to the rule of stare decisis and affirm the judgment below.
If the situation resulting from the baseball decisions is to be changed-, I think it far better to leave it to be dealt with by Congress than for this Court to becloud the situation further, either by making untenable distinctions between baseball and other professional sports, or by discriminatory fiat in favor of baseball.

He argues that it is necessary for railroad workers to be allowed to join union ""national in scope"" and ""organized in accord with"" the Railway Labor act. Rychlick was employed by the brotherhood as a railman until February 1953; after his resignation, he joined United Railroad Operating Crafts, an alternative union which had qualified under Section 2, First of the law as one of its electors on the national railroad adjustment board. The Brotherhood appealed to the court to deny Rychlik's discharge because of the presence of two representatives on the system board. However, when the court granted petitioners' motion to dismiss their complaint, the district court granted them relief. The court then decided that UROC would not satisfy the railway labor act because there was a bias against the Brotherdom at the hearing.

This does not require that in every such case the United States must furnish the defendant with a stenographic transcript of the trial. It is essential, however, that he be assured some appropriate means — such as the district judge’s notes or an agreed statement by trial counsel — of making manifest the basis of his claim that the District Court committed error in certifying that the desired appeal was not pursued in good faith.

The Remmer case, dealing with a Federal Bureau of Investigation inquiry into a suspected approach to a juror by a defendant, is not in our judgment controlling in this FBI inquiry of people who happened to be Gold jurors concerning a different Communist case. Compare the facts and conclusions of law in Remmer v. United States, 350 U. S. 377, 381, 382, and 347 U. S. 227, with the facts stated in Gold v. United States, 99 U. S. App. D. C. 136, 147, 237 F. 2d 764, 775.
While a presumption of prejudice arises when a juror in a criminal case receives a private communication bearing even remotely on the trial, the question in each such case is whether that presumption has been rebutted. Cf. *986Remmer v. United States, 347 U. S. 227, 229, and Mattox v. United States, 146 U. S. 140, 149-150.
We think the record showing of the jurors’ reaction to the present inquiry, Record 1586-1673, adequately supports the trial judge’s conclusion that no effect upon the jurors adverse to the defendant, because of the accidental intrusion upon their privacy, could reasonably be anticipated.
The juror and the alternate who felt disturbed by the incident were discharged. In our view this made it proper to go ahead, as the court did, with the trial.

While I too feel that the narrow ground of Remmer’s case should not be used to bring about reversal here, I am also disturbed by the refusal of the Court to decide other important questions urged upon us by both parties and ready for disposition. Among these are the applicability of the perjury rule of evidence to the false statement statute, eligibility of government employees to serve as jurors, admissibility of evidence of prior activity in the Communist Party to disprove the sincerity of a resignation therefrom, the use of expert witnesses to prove continuing membership and the correctness of the court’s charges as to membership in the Party, etc. It seems to me that proper judicial administration requires this Court to decide these important issues, particularly since they will again arise at the retrial. Furthermore, similar cases involving the same legal points are pending in various districts throughout the country. The refusal of the majority today to pass upon them thus deprives the federal judiciary of this Court’s opinion, which renders today’s error multifold. It will cause undue hardship in the trial of all of these cases, not only on the Government but on the defendants as well. I therefore dissent.

It discusses the provisions in the Railroad Labor Act, which created the national railroad adjustment board to deal with minor disputes. The case concerns grievances between members of one of the Brotherdom's railroad trainmen and the Chicago River and Indignant Stockyards. When negotiations were unsuccessful, the brotherhood called for strikes. Because of this crisis, the National Medation Board refused its services. After four days, however, the complaint was dismissed. The court vacated the order but granted a temporary injunction against the strike. Here, we examine the definition of ""minor disputes"" under the railway labor act. Major disputes are those where there is disagreement about an existing collective agreement. If the parties fail to reach an agreed-upon agreement, they may be brought before the national adjustment board. However, if the dispute does not involve major disputes, then both sides may submit the matter to the national adjustment board. Congress has established a tribunal so that minor disputes do not need to be resolved by the union or the carrier. Thus, it is necessary for the president to set up an emergency board to investigate these cases. The bill makes it unnecessary for either side to agree to form their own boards as opposed to having them appointed by the national mediation board. Finally, the law allows the national board to choose a neutral referencee to settle the disputes. As previously mentioned, the voice of labor opposes the passage of paragraph M, which gives the federal courts the power to issue indenctions in all kinds of labor disputes.

  Stephen Girard, by a will probated in 1831, left a fund in trust for the erection, maintenance, and operation of a “college.” The will provided that the college was to
   
   *231
   
  admit “as many poor white male orphans, between the ages of six and ten years, as the said income shall be adequate to maintain.” The will named as trustee the City of Philadelphia. The provisions of the will were carried out by the State and City and the college was opened in 1848. Since 1869, by virtue of an act of the Pennsylvania Legislature, the trust has been administered and the college operated by the “Board of Directors of City Trusts of the City of Philadelphia.” Pa. Laws 1869, No. 1258, p. 1276; Purdon’s Pa. Stat. Ann., 1957, Tit. 53, § 16365.
 

  In February 1954, the petitioners Foust and Felder applied for admission to the college. They met all qualifications except that they were Negroes. For this reason the Board refused to admit them. They petitioned the Orphans’ Court of Philadelphia County for an order directing the Board to admit them, alleging that their exclusion because of race violated the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution. The State of Pennsylvania and the City of Philadelphia joined in the suit also contending the Board’s action violated the Fourteenth Amendment. The Orphans’ Court rejected the constitutional contention and refused to order the applicants’ admission. 4 D. & C. 2d 671 (Orph. Ct. Philadelphia). This was affirmed by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. 386 Pa. 548, 127 A. 2d 287.
 

  The Board which operates Girard College is an agency of the State of Pennsylvania. Therefore, even though the Board was acting as a trustee, its refusal to admit Foust and Felder to the college because they were Negroes was discrimination by the State. Such discrimination is forbidden by the Fourteenth Amendment.

I agree that labor organizations are “employers” under § 2 (2) of the Act with respect to their own employees. I dissent, however, from the Court’s holding that the Board is without power to decline to assert jurisdiction over labor unions as a class. I am of the view that the Board has discretionary authority to decline to do so when the Board determines, for proper reasons, that the policies of the Act would not be effectuated by its assertion of jurisdiction.

Mr. Justice Douglas,
with whom Mr. Justice Black concurs,
dissenting.
I do not see how we can say that Congress withdrew the income tax from the reach of § 3616 (a). In the 1939 Internal Revenue Code that section was part of Sub-chapter B, “Determination of Tax Liability,” which was a part of Chapter 34, “Information and Returns,” which in turn was part of Subtitle D, “General Administrative Provisions.” Section 61 made applicable to the income tax *380provisions “All administrative, special, or stamp provisions of law, including the law relating to the assessment of taxes, so far as applicable . . . .” These administrative provisions include the chapter and subtitle of which § 3616 (a) is a part. And by its terms § 3616 (a) applies to “any” return. Plainly then, Congress in 1939 considered § 3616 (a) an instrument for enforcing the income tax.
It takes mental gymnastics to bring this crime out from under § 3616 (a) and to place it exclusively under § 145 (b). I would not make the penal consequences of an Act turn on a construction so tenuous. I rebel against it, especially because the construction now adopted sweeps the ground out from under dozens of criminal convictions which the Government has obtained under §3616 (a). Between October 1952 and March 1957 (when the Government first suggested to this Court that § 3616 (a) was inapplicable to the income tax), it invoked § 3616 (a) in 175 cases of alleged income tax evasion. It chose § 3616 (a), rather than § 145 (b), where it appeared that the crime was a relatively minor one. Of these 175 cases, 38 remain undisposed of. Of the 133 that went to trial, 117 resulted in pleas of guilty and 9 in pleas of nolo contendere. Seven defendants went to trial, of whom 5 were acquitted and 2 convicted. Of the 128 convicted persons, 26 were sentenced to imprisonment, the rest being fined or given probation or suspended sentences. Seven of the convicted persons who were sentenced are still incarcerated.
Now it appears that the Government dealt unlawfully with this group of citizens. Those who were convicted on indictments might have to be resentenced. Those who were convicted on informations must be released.
It is no answer to say that the result is “a break” for these defendants. From the statistics submitted to us by the Government it appears that many of these cases *381were so minor it is difficult to imagine a grand jury-returning indictments on them.
I would adhere to the administrative construction that § 3616 (a) applied to the income tax. Congress apparently was of that view. For when it came to the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, it re-enacted § 3616 (a) as § 7207, eliminating the words “with intent to defeat or evade” which had caused the overlap with § 145 (b). Congress acted, of course, prospectively.

This suit was brought in a United States District Court under § 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act of *4601947, 61 Stat. 156, 29 U. S. C. § 185, seeking specific enforcement of the arbitration provisions of a collective-bargaining contract. The District Court had jurisdiction over the action since it involved an obligation running to a union — a union controversy — and not uniquely personal rights of employees sought to be enforced by a union. Cf. Association of Westinghouse Employees v. Westinghouse Elec. Corp., 348 U. S. 437. Having jurisdiction over the suit, the court was not powerless to fashion an appropriate federal remedy. The power to decree specific performance of a collectively bargained agreement to arbitrate finds its source in § 301 itself,1 and in a Federal District Court’s inherent equitable powers, nurtured by a congressional policy to encourage and enforce labor arbitration in industries affecting commerce.2
I do not subscribe to the conclusion of the Court that the substantive law to be applied in a suit under § 301 is federal law. At the same time, I agree with Judge Magruder in International Brotherhood v. W. L. Mead, Inc., 230 F. 2d 576, that some federal rights may necessarily be involved in a § 301 case, and hence that the constitutionality of § 301 can be upheld as a congressional grant to Federal District Courts of what has been called “protective jurisdiction.”

Instead, they argue that the war courts perform functions more like juries than courts. The first stage of review involves the convening authorities, who are authorized to reduce an initial sentence though they cannot increase it; the second stage involves the board of reviews, composed of legally trained officers. They have broad powers beyond those of laymen under military law: they can weigh evidence, determine credibility among witnesses, and disapprove of findings of guilt without regard to how the court might have done with it considering only theapproved findings. Finally, the Congress gave the boards power to revise sentences when appropriate. Peter points to the possibility that the congress could have required the same type of sentence for each offense just as would be done in civilian courts.

dissenting.
I am unable to see how the action of the Board of Review can fairly be characterized as other than an original imposition of sentence by the Board for the offense of attempted rape. The Uniform Code of Military Justice grants no power to the Board to impose original sentences. 64 Stat. 128, 50 U. S. C. § 653. That power is reserved exclusively to the court-martial. There was, therefore, no valid gross sentence embracing attempted rape upon which the Board’s power to remit an excessive portion could operate. I subscribe to what Judge Major said in the similar case of De Coster v. Madigan, 223 F. 2d 906, 909-910 (C. A. 7th Cir. 1955), in which De Coster was allowed habeas corpus and ordered discharged:
“. . . While the court-martial obviously had jurisdiction of plaintiff and the offenses with which he was charged, it did not fully and fairly deal with him. The Law Officer instructed the court-martial that the minimum sentence which could be imposed on the murder charge was life imprisonment. But the Law Officer gave no instructions as to the punishment which could be imposed on the attempted rape charge. The court-martial found plaintiff guilty of both murder and attempted rape, but its sentence was life-imprisonment, the minimum sentence for the murder charge alone. Of course, any suggestion that the court-martial should have sentenced plaintiff for a term of life plus twenty years would be ridiculous, but equally so is the assertion that the court-martial did or intended to impose any part of its sentence for attempted rape. It lacked even the *582necessary instructions upon which such award of punishment would have to be based. Imposition of sentence by the proper authority is an essential step in administration of criminal justice. Here, under the statute, only the court-martial was authorized to take this step; it failed to do so.”

Mr. Justice Frankfurter,
concurring.
I deem it important to state what I understand to be the Court’s holding. Agreeing with its holding, I join its opinion.
The power of the Congress to punish for contempt of its authority is, as the Court points out, rooted in history. It has been acknowledged by this Court since 1821. Anderson v. Dunn, 6 Wheat. 204. Until 1857, Congress was content to punish for contempt through its own process. By the Act of January 24, 1857, 11 Stat. 155, as amended by the Act of January 24, 1862, 12 Stat. 333, Congress provided that, “in addition to the pains and penalties now existing” (referring of course to the power of Congress itself to punish for contempt), “contumacy in a witness called to testify in a matter properly under consideration by either House, and deliberately refusing to answer questions pertinent thereto, shall be a misdemeanor against the United States.” In re Chapman, 166 U. S. 661, 672. This legislation is now 2 U. S. C. § 192. By thus making the federal judiciary the affirmative agency for enforcing the authority that underlies the congressional power to punish for contempt, Congress necessarily brings into play the specific provisions of the Constitution relating to the prosecution of offenses and those implied restrictions under which courts function.
*217To turn to the immediate problem before us, the scope of inquiry that a committee is authorized to pursue must be defined with sufficiently unambiguous clarity to safeguard a witness from the hazards of vagueness in the enforcement of the criminal process against which the Due Process Clause protects. The questions must be put with relevance and definiteness sufficient to enable the witness to know whether his refusal to answer may lead to conviction for criminal contempt and to enable both the trial and the appellate courts readily to determine whether the particular circumstances justify a finding of guilt.
While implied authority for the questioning by the Committee, sweeping as was its inquiry, may be squeezed out of the repeated acquiescence by Congress in the Committee’s inquiries, the basis for determining petitioner’s guilt is not thereby laid. Prosecution for contempt of Congress presupposes an adequate opportunity for the defendant to have awareness of the pertinency of the information that he has denied to Congress. And the basis of such awareness must be contemporaneous with the witness’ refusal to answer and not at the trial for it. Accordingly, the actual scope of the inquiry that the Committee was authorized to conduct and the relevance of the questions to that inquiry must be shown to have been luminous at the time when asked and not left, at best, in cloudiness. The circumstances of this case were wanting in these essentials.

My views on the right of a State to protect its people against the purveyance of obscenity were expressed in Alberts v. California, post, p. 476, also decided today. Here we have an entirely different situation.
This is not a criminal obscenity case. Nor is it a case ordering the destruction of materials disseminated by a person who has been convicted of an offense for doing so, as would be authorized under provisions in the laws of New York and other States. It is a case wherein the New York police, under a different state statute, located books which, in their opinion, were unfit for public use because of obscenity and then obtained a court order for their condemnation and destruction.
The majority opinion sanctions this proceeding. I would not. Unlike the criminal cases decided today, this New York law places the book on trial. There is totally *446lacking any standard in the statute for judging the book in context. The personal element basic to the criminal laws is entirely absent. In my judgment, the same object .may have wholly different impact depending upon the setting in which it is placed. Under this statute, the setting is irrelevant.
It is the manner of use that should determine obscenity. It is the conduct of the individual that should be judged, not the quality of art or literature. To do otherwise is to impose a prior restraint and hence to violate the Constitution. Certainly in the absence of a prior judicial determination of illegal use, books, pictures and other objects of expression should not be destroyed. It savors too much of book burning.
I would reverse.

5640,9421492,105544,040dissent,"Douglas defends the provision in the New York Constitution for a pendentelite decree to prevent publisher from publishing material that is ""obscene."" He argues that this provision gives the state the power of censorship. A decree cannot issue ex parte, without a finding on the matter of obscense. The only way an order can be issued ex parte is by a court hearing. If the publisher were selling tracts to children or professional people, then the distribution of the tracts would violate the First Amendment because it would allow the accused to separate from the group of people who sold them. In other words, every publication is different from the case before. This means that the judge or juror may differ in his opinion about what should be done with the published material. Therefore, the system approved by the court goes far toward creating the censor Supreme. It also replaces punishment by conempt for punishment through jury trial. Justice Black disagrees and points out that the absence of the right to jury trials is a tragic defect. However, he believes that there are provisions for jury trials under the Civil Practice Act but only those for discretionary verdicts. The Court did not answer the question of whether the standards necessary for preventing material from being obscenzed include a jury decision. Thus, a statute does not afford any right to a defendant as a result of a judgment declaring that material is ""Obscene""",1957-06-24,1.0

Mr. Justice Black,
dissenting.
The Illinois statute involved here provides a state-wide regulatory plan to protect the public from irresponsible and insolvent sellers of money orders. The Act specifically exempts the American Express Company’s money orders from its regulatory provisions because, as the Court recognizes, that company “is a world-wide enter*471prise of unquestioned solvency and high financial standing.” I cannot agree with the Court that this exemption denies actual and potential competitors of the American Express Company equal protection of the laws within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment. Only recently this Court held that “[t]he prohibition of the Equal Protection Clause goes no further than the invidious discrimination.” Williamson v. Lee Optical of Oklahoma, Inc., 348 U. S. 483, 489. And here, whatever one may think of the merits of this legislation, its exemption of a company of known solvency from a solvency test applied to others of unknown financial responsibility can hardly be called “invidious.” Unless state legislatures have, power to make distinctions that are not plainly unreasonable, then the ability of the States to protect their citizens by regulating business within their boundaries can be seriously impaired. I feel it necessary to express once again my objection to the use of general provisions of the Constitution to restrict narrowly state power over state domestic economic affairs.1
I think state regulation should be viewed quite differently where it touches or involves freedom of speech, press, religion, petition, assembly, or other specific safeguards of the Bill of Rights. It is the duty of this Court to be alert to see that these constitutionally preferred rights are not abridged.2 But the Illinois statute here *472does not involve any of these basic liberties. And since I believe that it is not “invidiously discriminatory,” I would not hold it invalid.

5644,9421495,105546,040dissent,"In this brief, Justice Harlan argues that the Fourteen- Amendment has barred state governments from making decisions on issues of public importance. The court's reasoning is that there are significant divisions among the courts in interpreting the clause. For example, some courts interpret the clause as prohibiting states from denying anyone ""the equal protection"" of the laws; others interpret it as barring a state from making its own decisions on matters of public interest. Although the Court does not explicitly deny such rights, Harlan contends that the distinction between classifying legislation and emphasizing actualities or abstract identities is an exercise in logic. Both decisions were based on narrow margins, but they ultimately resulted in cases where the Supreme Court found them to be false leads. It was important for the court to avoid drawing too much on specific language of the Constitution because it would lead to confusion. Illinois had one of the most far reaching legislative powers under the constitution: the government needed to issue and sell money orders. If the state chose to regulate its banks, then the state itself could take control of the business. However, since the bank issued money orders directly, rather than through a cash dispensary, the state did not need to worry about whether the American Express Company would be able to keep up its present characteristics while selling competing money orders outside of the regulation set by the Constitution.",1957-06-24,1.0
5645,9421496,105547,020lead,"In this paper, the Court focuses on three constitutional questions: whether Congress's criminal obscense statute violates First Amendment protection of speech and print; whether Congress has the power to punish ""speech and press"" where offensive to due process is in the states alone; and whether Congress pre-empts the regulation of such matters by enforcing the federal law. The first question concerns whether the federal laws violate the provision of Article I, XI, that Congress shall not make no law. Second, whether Congress may have the power under the Ninth or Tenth amendments to regulate the subject matter. Alberts conducts a mail order business in Los Angeles. His convictions are affirmed by an appeal to the Second Court. Although this case is the first for the Court to address the question of whether obscence is within the protected area of public speech and press, it is clear that the Constitution does not protect any utterance outside the area of free speech and presse. It is evident that the unconditional language of the constitution did not protect every word. However, there is evidence that these laws were not as completely developed as liclabel law, but that they were outside the protection meant for speeches and press. All ideas having little redeeming social significance have the fullprotection of the guiaranties except excludably because they entangle upon the limited areas of more important interest. This argument is further supported by the fact that all ideas having even slightest redeemable social importance - unorthodox ideas -- controversial ideas,even ideas hatefulto the prevailingclimate of opinion - have the complete protection of the fiaranty, unless excluded because they engage in the narrower area of most important interests. These include lewd lascivuous material, which deals with sexual desires. Sex also has been considered a vital problem of human interest since the nineteenth century.",1957-06-24,1.0

5647,9421498,105547,035concurrenceinpart,"In this paper, Harlan argues that the Court's opinion in two cases is too broad. First, it paints a broad view of the issues involved in federal and state law regarding whether or not an individual can be punished for selling books considered undesirable because of ""the deleterious effects upon human conduct."" Second, the court ignores any distinction between the two types of government powers to punish individuals who sell books considered desirable because of their ""utterly without redemptioning social importance."" Third, the case does not address the constitutional question of whether obscenitity is protected by either the First or Fourteenth amendments. The Court assumes that ""obscent"" is a kind of abstract term used to describe speech and press which has an individual value. It cannot be resolved in generalized terms. Finally, the Court seems to believe that both states and federal courts have power to enforce these laws. If they are found guilty, no juries will find them obviously unredeemable. This means that neither state nor federal courts must make independent judgments on the characters of the books they are accused of selling. For example, Joyce's Ulysses would raise the gravest Constitutional problems since no jury could find such books as decameron were opscene. However, even if the verdict was wrong, there would be no convincing argument that the books are truly without redeeming society importance. Therefore, the only problem with the court's decision is whether the court should judge the facts differently than the judges do when dealing with state and federal laws.

The railroads had proposed a new law in 1938 which allowed them to deduct any overpaid portion of the bill from subsequent payments. This would allow the carriers to make further efforts to recoup the amount due on the subsequent payment. However, the courts do not believe that the railways are entitled to recover the entire amount of the 1949 bill because they have no right to sue directly for damages.

However, the legislative history shows that Congress intends to permit private lawsuits to be brought against individuals who violate the terms of the Robinson Patman Act.

He rejects many of the earlier precedents that have been used to deny the power of judges to punish criminals in summary process. He believes that the previous decisions were wrong because they did not explicitly state that courts could punish contempt by ""summary proceedings."" The Court does not believe that it is necessary to use summary procedures to punish people who are accused of certain offenses; instead, it believes that there is no reason why such measures should be taken. Instead, the court has established a system designed to prevent oppression from being enforced and to concentrate its power in the hand of any officer or official. Judges remain human even when they assume their judicial roles. A fair trial is essential to due process under the Constitution: Fairness requires absence of actual biased in the trial but our system of laws has always strived to preventeven the probability of unjustness. It is important to note that the definition of contempt includes all sorts of vague terms like ""any conduct tending to bring the authorities and administration of law into disregard or disregard."" This means that an accuser can be punished without having to go through with a formal trial. However, some critics claim that the American courts never had the power to prosecute contempts out of court as long as the case is tried by jury.

5740,9421561,105658,020lead,"Petitioner is a citizen who has been declared national of the U.S. by operation of ""the Nationality Act"" of 1940, which states that a man who becomes naturalized in another country or participates in an election will lose his American Citizenship. He seeks to appeal to the Court's opinion that these provisions are beyond Congress' authority to enacted. Petder was born and lived in Texas until 1909. When he entered the United States after World War 2, he did not know about the duty of men to register for political elections. In 1943, he applied as an alien railway laborer but was denied entry because he had returned to Mexico before wartime. The Board of Immigrant Appeals ordered him deported as illegally in the US but allowed him to remain as an agricultural laborer without having a valid immigrant visa. Petyer brought suit against the federal government in 1954 declaring him a national under the Nationality act of 1868. The court disagreed with the court's interpretation of this provision. Although the Constitution does not explicitly state that Americans can withdraw their citizenship when they engage in certain activities abroad, it seems likely that Congress would have no authority to do so since the State Department doesn't have any specific legislative authority to nullify citizenship. However, several presidents of the time advocated for Congress to define how citizens should be treated when they become naturalized outside of the nation. The Citizenship Board made a report in 1906 proposing that people could be considered expatriates when they became naturalized within five years of being naturalized inside a foreign territory. The board also recommended that women who married foreigners be considered as losing their American citizenship during Coverture. The House passed a bill amending the Naturalization Law of 1907 adding a prohibition on marriage between American citizens and foreigners. The Supreme Court held that marrying foreigners may have consequences. It concludes that this isn't just arbitrary; it involves more than individual considerations. By the late 1930's, the laws concerning nationality were scattered throughout the legislation books. Some contained provisions that seemed inconsistent with other laws, such as those dealing with naturalization. A committee composed of the Attorney General and Secretary of Labor formed a committee to study the nationality law of the united states. They wrote a code detailing the various acts that would lead to loss of American citizenship. The Senate approved the new bill",1958-03-31,1.0

He asserts that it is fundamental to the form of government that ""this government was born of our citizens, it maintained itself in 'a continuing relationship"" with them and, in his judgment, it cannot be taken away from them. The Constitution provides for naturalization under an uniform rule of Naturalization but does not authorize divestments. Citizenship can be relinquishing or abjured by other means. Two cases have been decided concerning the right of voluntary exatriation: Savorgnaan v. U.S. 491, and Mackenzie-Hare v.001 United States Supreme Court ruled that Americans could lose their citizenship by marrying a foreign country. However, the court has held that such actions do not necessarily result in reversion of nationality. It has been recognized that some voluntary acts result in an impasse on the status of citizenhood. This case concerns the constitutional provisions regarding the loss of nationalities. A person who casts a ballot in a Foreign Election may not be able to demonstrate that he lost his citizenship because of circumstances outside the United States that would compromise his allies.",1958-03-31,1.0

The Court has held that it is impossible for Congress to force a citizen to relinquished his American citizenship when he votes in an international political election. However, Douglas points to the fact that the Fourteenh Amendment grants citizenship only to the Native-born. He contends that such a right cannot be granted without a strong relationship between the citizen and the government.

However, the court finds that the Civil War Act did not provide for such a provision. It was changed so that deserters would lose their nationality only if they were dismissed from service or discharged. This means that there are many young men subject to this new power. Thus, it is necessary for the government to decide whether a person will continue to be an American under the provisions contained in Section 401 g of the Nationalities Act of 1865. If a soldier is found guilty of any crime, then he must have served time in the military or navy before being allowed to return to civilian life.

Mr. Justice Black,
whom
Mr. Justice Douglas joins, concurring.
While I concur in the opinion of The Chief Justice there is one additional thing that needs to be said.
Even if citizenship could be involuntarily divested, I do not believe that the power to denationalize may be placed in the hands of military authorities. If desertion or other misconduct is to be a basis for forfeiting citizenship, guilt should be determined in a civilian court of justice where all the protections of the Bill of Rights guard the fairness of the outcome. Such forfeiture should not rest on the findings of a military tribunal. Military courts may try soldiers and punish them for military offenses, but they should not have the last word on the soldier’s right to citizenship. The statute held invalid *105here not only makes the military’s finding of desertion 'final but gives military authorities discretion to choose which soldiers convicted of desertion shall be allowed to keep their citizenship and which ones shall thereafter be stateless. Nothing in the Constitution or its history lends the slightest support for such military control over the right to be an American citizen.

However, there are other provisions in the Constitution that allow Congress to extend this power to military forces. For example, in 1865, Congress passed the ""Nationality Act,"" which allowed for the expulsion of deserters from the United States after they had been imprisoned or sentenced to death. This law did not explicitly make certain that the prisoner would have to be convicted by courtmartial before being released.

I think the evidence is insufficient to raise a question for the jury as to whether petitioner’s decedent at the time of the accident was a seaman within the purview of the Jones Act.
Respondent was the owner of a wharf, barge and tug, all situated on the Mississippi River. The barge was moored to the wharf, and the tug was lashed to the barge. On October 7, 1953, the decedent met death by drowning in unclear circumstances. He was last seen alive running across the barge to the tug, and it was petitioner’s theory of the case that the decedent had fallen into the river between the barge and the tug, and that respondent was liable under the Jones Act because of his negligent failure to provide a gangplank for crossing between the two vessels.
For some months before the accident the tug had been withdrawn from navigation because it was inoperable. During the entire year of 1953 the tug had neither captain nor crew and reported no earnings; the only evidence of its movement during the year related to an occasion on which it was towed to dry dock. At the time of the accident the tug was undergoing rehabilitation preparatory to a Coast Guard inspection, presumably in anticipation of a return to service. During the period of the tug’s inactivity, the decedent was employed as a laborer doing odd jobs around respondent’s wharf, and on the morning of the accident he had been engaged in cleaning the boiler of the tug.
In my opinion it taxes imagination to the breaking point to consider this unfortunate individual to have been *273a seaman at the time of the accident within the meaning of the Jones Act, and I think that if a jury were so to find, its verdict would have to be set aside. Desper v. Starved Rock Ferry Co., 342 U. S. 187. Because I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals on this ground, I do not reach the question whether the accident was attributable in any way to respondent’s negligence.

The sole question presented by the case is this:
Under his powers and duties to effectuate the scheme designed by Congress through the Packers and Stockyards Act of 1921, for the regulation of the stockyards industry, is the Secretary of Agriculture barred from determining on the basis of evidence whether or not regulations are reasonable that are promulgated by the Denver Stockyards for the purpose of preventing the diversion of stockyard services from the Denver Stockyards that as a matter of normal business flow would go to the Denver yards, on the challenge to such regulations by a market agency registered at the Denver Stockyards to furnish “reasonable stockyard services” at that yard?
To deny the Secretary of Agriculture the power even to hear evidence as to the reasonableness of such regulations is to misconceive the whole scheme for the regional *293regulation of the stockyards industry for which stockyards and market agencies are geographically licensed, and to deny to the Secretary of Agriculture powers of administration that Congress has conferred upon him.
While a regulation may, like the one in question, on its face — that is, abstractly considered — appear to be unreasonable because discriminatory, elucidation of such a regulation in the concrete, on the basis of its practical operation in light of evidence, may negative such appearance. It is for the Secretary of Agriculture to hear such relevant evidence and to assess it, subject to the appropriate scope of judicial review. This proceeding should therefore be remanded to the Secretary of Agriculture for appropriate action. These views aré elaborated in Mr. Justice Whittaker's opinion, which I join.

The Denver Union stock yard company is the owner of the Denver union stockyard, which was established under the Packers and Yards Act in 1921. Under the Act, petitioner had to furnish reasonable request without discrimination or unreasonable stockyard services for such stockyard as it did not exist at the time. In response to petitioner's complaint, the Secretary published an amendment to the existing regulations; however, the proposed regulations do not comply with the provisions contained in the Act. Respondent filed a lawsuit against the Secretary on July 7, 1956, alleging violations of the Act's provisions regarding the provision for market agencies to establish regulations and practices only in respect to selling livestock at the Stock Yard. It also asserted that the regulation was unjust, unfair, and discriminatory. On December 24, 1956, respondent tried to present evidence but failed. The Court appealed to the decision and dismissed the suit. The court found the challenged regulations invalid because they conflicted with the requirements of the act. However, the Court disagreed upon the fact that the rules apply only to one person who has the right to do business at the Denverunion stockyard. The first issue concerns whether the laws prohibit a market agent from soliciting other markets, soliciting any business for Sale at Outside Fee Yards or at Country Points, or endeavoring To induce livestock owners Not to buy orsell on the Denver branch. The second issue concerns how the law can be used to prevent a trader from engaging in illegal practices at the stock yards. The third issue concerns what the law will mean when it comes to enforcement of the regulations. Congress gave the Secretary the power to decide what regulations should be followed after full hearing. The Constitution states that the term ""stockyard owner"" means anyone engaged in the buying or selling of commerce livestock at either a public marketplace or within a particular factory. The term ""dealer"" refers to someone who does not have the authority to purchase or sell in commerce live stocks. The definition of dealer includes people who do not own a trading company.

The trial court in this case, according to the views expressed in my concurring opinion in Sherman v. United States, ante, p. 378, should itself have ruled on the issue of entrapment and not left it to determination by the jury. On a mere reading of the cold record the evidence for sustaining such a claim seems rather thin. But the judge who heard and saw the witnesses might give different weight to the evidence than the printed record reveals. Accordingly, I would remand the case to the District Court for determination of the issue of entrapment by the trial judge. If he should conclude, as the jury was allowed to conclude, that the claim of entrapment was not sustained, the conviction would stand. If he reached a different result, the indictment should be dismissed. This seems, on my view of the law, a better disposition than for this Court to decide that no harm was done in leaving the question to the jury because as a matter of law there was no entrapment.

Golden Gate did not have any business activity or were not a carrier. Under the agreed-upon terms, Pacific Greyhog would transfer all of its operating rights in San Francisco to Golden Gate. Although the State Council opposes the deal, the hearing officer recommends disapproval. The Congress wanted to expedite the consolidation of railway lines into a smaller number of systems. However, it had already passed a provision authorizing the approval of carrier-indulgent plans without having to invoke any approval under state authority.

I join in Mr. Justice Frankfurter's dissenting opinion, but desire to add two further reasons why I believe the judgment of the Court of Appeals should be affirmed. As I read that court’s opinion, it held that under South Carolina law the construction of facilities needed to transmit electric power was necessarily a part of the business of furnishing power, whether such construction was performed by the respondent itself or let out to others, and that in either case respondent would be liable to petitioner for compensation as his statutory employer. Since there is no dispute that respondent at the time of the accident was engaged in the business of furnishing power and that petitioner was injured while engaged in construction in furtherance of that business, I do not perceive how any further evidence which might be adduced by petitioner could change the result reached by the Court of Appeals. In any event, in the circumstances disclosed by the record before us, we should at the very least require petitioner to make some showing here of the character of the further evidence he expects to introduce before we disturb the judgment below.

Petitioner was charged in four separate indictments with murdering his wife and three children, all of whom, with bullet wounds in their heads, were found dead in a burning building during the early hours of December 5, 1953. In three successive trials, petitioner was found guilty of the first degree murder of his wife and two of his children. At each of the trials the prosecution introduced into evidence details of all four deaths. Under Illinois law the jury is charged with the responsibility of fixing the penalty for first degree murder from 14 years’ imprisonment to death. Ill. Rev. Stat., 1957, c. 38, § 360. At the first two trials, involving the death of the wife and one of the children, the jury fixed the penalty at 20 and 45 years’ imprisonment respectively. At the third trial, involving the death of a second child, the penalty was fixed at death. On appeal the Supreme Court of Illinois affirmed the conviction, 8 Ill. 2d 619, 137 N. E. 2d 40, and we granted certiorari to consider petitioner’s claim that this third trial violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. 353 U.

It is conceded that under Illinois law each of the murders, although apparently taking place at the same time, constituted a separate crime and it is undisputed that evidence of the entire occurrence was relevant in each of the three prosecutions.

The petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit is granted. Charged in a three-count indictment for violation of R. S. § 102, as amended, 2 U. S. C. § 192, for failure to answer three questions put to him by a subcommittee of the Internal Security Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, the petitioner, having waived *577trial by jury, was found guilty on all counts and sentenced to six months’ imprisonment and to pay a fine of $1,000. After the sentence was sustained by the Court of Appeals, 99 U. S. App. D. C. 360, 240 F. 2d 46, this Court, having granted a petition for certiorari, remanded the case, 354 U. S. 930, to the Court of Appeals for reconsideration in light of Watkins v. United States, 354 U. S. 178. On reargument before the Court of Appeals sitting en banc, a divided court again affirmed the conviction. 102 U. S. App. D. C. 264, 252 F. 2d 828.
The broad scope of authority vested in Congress to conduct investigations as an incident to the “legislative Powers” granted by the Constitution is not questioned. See Watkins v. United States, supra, at 215. But when Congress seeks to enforce its investigating authority through the criminal process administered by the federal judiciary, the safeguards of criminal justice become operative. The subject matter of inquiry before the subcommittee at which petitioner appeared as a witness concerned the recantation of prior testimony by a witness named Matusow. In the course of the hearing, the questioning of petitioner entered upon a “brief excursion,” 99 U. S. App. D. C. 360, 367, 240 F. 2d 46, 53, into proposed legislation barring Communists from practice at the federal bar, a subject not within the subcommittee’s scope of inquiry as authorized by its parent committee. Inasmuch as petitioner’s refusal to answer related to questions not clearly pertinent to the subject on which the two-member subcommittee conducting the hearing had been authorized to take testimony, the conditions necessary to sustain a conviction for deliberately refusing to answer questions pertinent to the authorized subject matter of a congressional hearing are wanting. Watkins v. United States, supra. The judgment of the *578Court of Appeals is therefore reversed and the cause remanded to the District Court with directions to dismiss the indictment.

In joining the Court’s opinion, I am constrained to write these few words with reference to my Brother Clark’s suggestion that the Court should hear argument in this case. As the limited scope of the Subcommittee’s authority is not in dispute, the controlling issue is whether the pertinency of the questions put to petitioner was of such “undisputable clarity” as to justify his punishment in a court of law for refusing to answer them. Watkins v. United States, 354 U. S. 178, 214. That issue can only be determined by scrutiny of the record, and a full-dress argument could hardly shed further light on the matter. In such circumstances prompt disposition of the case before us certainly constitutes sound judicial administration. For my part, it is abundantly evident that the pertinency of none of the three questions involved can be regarded as undisputably clear, as indeed is evidenced by the different interpretations of the record advanced by the members of this Court and of the Court of Appeals who have considered the issue.

Mr. Justice Whittaker,
concurring;
Believing that appellees did not make a sufficient showing of such exceptional and particularized need for the grand jury minutes as justified wholesale invasion of their secrecy in the circumstances of this case, I concur in the Court’s decision, but desire to add a word.
Although a “no true bill” was voted by the grand jury in this case — and, hence, the Government’s attorneys, agents and investigators were then through with the grand jury proceedings, if they were conducted for lawful purposes — the Government admits that it has used the grand jury minutes and transcripts in its preparation, and that it intends to use them in its prosecution, of this civil case. Appellees suggest, principally on the basis that no indictment was prepared, presented to or asked of the grand jury, that the Government’s purpose in conducting the grand jury investigation was to obtain, ex parte, direct or derivative evidence for its use in this civil suit which then was contemplated. But the District Court made no finding of such a fact. However, it is obvious that such could be, and probably has often been, the real purpose of grand jury investigations in like cases. The grand jury minutes and transcripts are not the property of the Government’s attorneys, agents or *685investigators, nor are they entitled to possession of them in such a case. Instead those documents are records of the court. And it seems clear that where, as here, a “no true bill” has been voted, their secrecy, which the law wisely provides, may be as fully violated by disclosure to and use by the government counsel, agents and investigators as by the defendants’ counsel in such a civil suit.
In order to maintain the secrecy of grand jury proceedings; to eliminate the temptation to conduct grand jury investigations as a means of ex parte procurement of direct or derivative evidence for use in a contemplated civil suit; and to eliminate, so far as possible, fundamental unfairness and inequality by permitting the Government’s attorneys, agents and investigators to possess and use such materials while denying like possession and use by attorneys for the defendants in such a case, I would adopt a rule requiring that the grand jury minutes and transcripts and all copies thereof and memoranda made therefrom, in cases where a “no true bill” has been voted, be promptly upon return sealed and impounded with the clerk of the court, subject to inspection by any party to such a civil suit only upon order of the court made, after notice and hearing, upon a showing of such exceptional and particularized need as is necessary to establish “good cause,” in the circumstances, under Rule 34.

concurring.
I concur in the Court's decision, but desire briefly to state my reasons.
Although in a strict legal sense the Board has not delegated its duty under § 11 (1) to rule upon motions to revoke subpoenas duces tecum, but has, by § 102.58 (c) of its Rules and Regulations, merely given to its regional directors, hearing officers or examiners the task of making preliminary or interim rulings on such motions — recognizing, in § 102.57 (c) of its Rules and Regulations, its statutory duty finally to rule upon such motions either upon an immediate, though discretionary, interlocutory appeal or upon review of the completed record in the *9course of its decision of the whole proceeding — yet, as a practical matter, neither such discretionary appeal nor review of the completed record affords any certainty of the protection specified by Congress, in § 11 (1), to be given by the Board against an improper or oppressive subpoena duces tecum. For, notwithstanding its duty under § 11 (1), the Board, under § 102.57 (c) of its Rules and Regulations, may refuse to allow such interlocutory appeal and, hence, refuse to rule upon the motion to revoke in advance of the time fixed by such subpoena for compliance. It is obvious that, after the illegal or oppressive subpoena has been enforced, the Board on its review of the completed record can no more relieve the consummated oppression than it can unring a bell. But, as the Court’s opinion points out, Congress has provided, in § 11 (2), that the Board’s subpoenas may be enforced only by a United States District Court, and thus an effective means exists to revoke an illegal or oppressive subpoena duces tecum before the damage has been done. For this practical reason I accept the legalisms of the Board’s nondelegation argument and concur in the decision of the Court.

Mr. Chief Justice Warren,
dissenting.
There can be no doubt that the problem in this case is a problem of federalism. Competing considerations of the greatest significance are involved. But in resolving questions that touch upon the intricate and delicate mechanism of our federal system it is especially important to remember, as Mr. Justice Holmes observed, that “General propositions do not decide concrete cases.” Lochner v. New York, 198 U. S. 45, 76. In this case the New York courts sustained petitioner’s conviction on the under*382standing that in the circumstances of this case the testimony petitioner was compelled to give before the New York State grand jury could not, as a matter of federal law, be employed in a subsequent federal prosecution. On the other hand, it is implicit in the majority opinion in this Court that the petitioner does run the risk of a federal prosecution based on his own testimony under Feldman v. United States, 322 U. S. 487. If we are to have any profitable discussion of federalism based on the facts of this case, we should begin with agreement on the facts and the controlling principles. In any event, we should not affirm a New York conviction if in fact the state courts construed state law under a misconception of federal law. To do so does violence to the vital principle of federalism that a state court is the final arbiter of state law. See May v. Anderson, 345 U. S. 528, 534, 535. I therefore agree with Mr. Justice Black that this case should be remanded so that the New York Court of Appeals can reconsider state law in light of the majority’s conclusion that the role of the federal prosecutor was not such as to prevent use of the state-compelled testimony against petitioner in a federal prosecution. At all events, the unsettling influence that Feldman has had upon the course of this litigation indicates that a satisfactory solution cannot be reached without a reconsideration of that decision.

Petitioner, pursuant to a request left by the police at his home on Saturday, December 17, appeared at headquarters in Orange, New Jersey, at 9 a. m. on the 18th. He did so on the advice of his lawyer, Frank A. Palmieri. Petitioner’s brother and father accompanied him on this visit but were separated from him on arrival at the headquarters. Shortly thereafter petitioner was taken to Newark where he was interrogated by the police until 9:30 p. m. when he confessed. Between 2 p. m. and 9:30 p. m. Mr. Palmieri asked over and again to see his client; but his requests were not granted. On this phase of the case the District Court said:
“Mr. Palmieri was not produced as a witness on the trial of this case, but his affidavit was admitted by *512stipulation. The contents of his affidavit and the testimony of petitioner’s father and brother are at variance with the testimony of the Newark police as to the manner in which petitioner and his counsel were restrained from communicating with each other. According to petitioner’s witnesses Palmieri’s pleas were met with blunt refusals and remarks such as 'We’re working on him.’ The police claim to have been much more decorous. But whether it was done flippantly or courteously, the fact remains that for over seven hours the Newark police formed an insuperable barrier between an accused who wanted to see his counsel, and counsel who wanted to see his client. And it was during these seven hours that the police and an assistant prosecutor were able to obtain a detailed confession from petitioner.” 148 F. Supp. 98, 99-100.
The District Court reached “without enthusiasm” the conclusion that petitioner’s constitutional rights had not been impaired. Id., at 104. The Court of Appeals evinced the same lack of enthusiasm for the result. 240 F. 2d 844. Both lower courts felt that any correction of this unjust result should come from us. I regret that we have not taken this case, and the companion cases, as the occasion to bring our decisions into tune with the constitutional requirement for fair criminal proceedings against the citizen.

*546Mr. Justice Brennan
delivered the opinion of the Court.
These are companion cases to Speiser v. Randall and Prince v. City and County of San Francisco, ante, p. 513. The petitioners claimed the property-tax exemption provided by Art. XIII, § 1%, of the California Constitution for real property and buildings used solely and exclusively for religious worship. The Los Angeles assessor denied the exemptions because each petitioner refused to subscribe, and struck from the prescribed application form, the oath that they did not advocate the overthrow of the Government of the United States and of the State of California by force or violence or other unlawful means nor advocate the support of a foreign government against the United States in the event of hostilities. Each petitioner sued in the Superior Court in and for the County of Los Angeles to recover taxes paid under protest and for declaratory relief. Both contended that the exaction of the oath pursuant to § 19 of Art. XX of the State Constitution and § 32 of the California Revenue and Taxation Code was forbidden by the Federal Constitution. The court upheld the validity of the provisions in the action brought by petitioner First Unitarian Church of Los Angeles, and the Supreme Court of California affirmed. 48 Cal. 2d 419, 311 P. 2d 508. We granted certiorari. 355 U. S. 853. The Superior Court in the action brought by petitioner Valley Unitarian-Universalist Church, Inc., upheld the validity of the provisions under the Federal Constitution but held that § 32 of the Revenue and Taxation Code violated the California Constitution because it excluded or exempted householders from the requirement. The Supreme Court of California reversed, 48 Cal. 2d 899, 311 P. 2d 540, and we granted certiorari, 355 U. S. 854.
In addition to the contentions advanced by the appellants in Speiser v. Randall, the petitioners argue that the *547provisions are invalid under the Fourteenth Amendment as abridgments of religious freedom and as violations of the principle of separation of church and state. Our disposition of the cases, however, makes consideration of these questions unnecessary. For the reasons expressed in Speiser v. Randall, we hold that the enforcement of § 19 of Art. XX of the State Constitution through procedures which place the burdens of proof and persuasion on the taxpayer is a violation of due process.
The judgments are reversed and the causes remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.

Reversed and remanded.

Mr. Justice Douglas,
with whom Mr. Justice Black agrees, concurring.
What I have said in Speiser v. Randall and Prince v. San Francisco, decided this day, ante, p. 532, is sufficient for these cases as well. But there is a related ground on which the decision in these Unitarian cases should rest. We know from the record one principle of that church:
“The principles, moral and religious, of the First Unitarian Church of Los Angeles compel it, its members, officers and minister, as a matter of deepest conscience, belief and conviction, to deny power in the state to compel acceptance by it or any other church of this or any other oath of coerced affirmation as to church doctrine, advocacy or beliefs.”
*548We stated in Girouard v. United States, 328 U. S. 61, 69, “The test oath is abhorrent to our tradition.” See American Communications Assn. v. Douds, 339 U. S. 382, 445 (dissenting opinion). The reason for that abhorrence is the supremacy of conscience in our constitutional scheme. As we stated in Board of Education v. Barnette, 319 U. S. 624, 642, “If there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation, it is that no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by word or act their faith therein.”
There is no power in our Government to make one bend his religious scruples to the requirements of this tax law.

dissenting.
For the reasons stated in my dissenting opinion in No. 483, Speiser v. Randall, and No. 484, Prince v. San Francisco, ante, p. 538, I cannot agree either that California law imposes the burden which the Court considers here, or that such a burden in any event would cause the procedure established by § 32 of the California Revenue and Taxation Code to violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Again for reasons stated in my dissenting opinion in Speiser and Prince, supra, I find no violation of the constitutional right to freedom of speech.
The majority notes the further contention here that freedom of religion is abridged, but has no occasion to consider it. The California court found that no tenet of petitioners’ respective religions embraces the activity which is the subject of the state provisions. Nor does it appear that such activity can be characterized as religious in nature. Cf. Davis v. Beason, 133 U. S. 333 (1890); Reynolds v. United States, 98 U. S. 145 (1879). I would affirm.

Mr. Justice Frankfurter,
dissenting.
Here we have not the application of some broad, generalized legal conception, either of a statutory nature, like “restraint of trade” in the Sherman Law, or a constitutional provision, like “due process of law” or “the equal protection of the laws.” Such conceptions do not carry contemporaneous fixity. By their very nature they imply a process of unfolding content.
Our immediate problem is quite different. The pre-1954 Housing Act does not leave us at large for judicial application of a generalized legislative policy in light of developing circumstances. The pre-1954 statute deals with a particularized problem in a particularized way. It presents the usual question of statutory construction where language is not clear enough to preclude human ingenuity from creating ambiguity. It is outside the judicial function to add to the scope of legislation. The task is imaginatively to extrapolate the contemporaneous answer that the Legislature would have given to an unconsidered question; here, whether rentals to transients were totally prohibited. It was not until 1954 that the Congress did deal with the question of the right of apartment-house owners to rent even a small number of apartments to transients without even remotely seeking to evade or to disadvantage the interests of veterans in whose behalf the Government, through the Federal Housing Administration, insured the mortgages of private owners. The opinions of the District Court and my *93brother Harlan seem to me compelling on the construction of the pre-1954 legislation.
This brings me to the validity of the 1954 enactment which presents for me a much more difficult question than that of the problem of statutory construction just considered. This is so because of the very weighty presumption of constitutionality that I deem it essential to attribute to any Act of Congress. This case falls between such cases sustaining the retroactive validity of legislation adversely affecting an existing interest as Paramino Co. v. Marshall, 309 U. S. 370, and Fleming v. Rhodes, 331 U. S. 100, on the one hand, and Lynch v. United States, 292 U. S. 571, on the other. While, to be sure, differentiation between “remedy” and “right” takes us into treacherous territory, the difference is not meaningless. The two earlier cases cited may fairly be deemed to sustain retroactive remedial modifications even though they affect existing “rights,” while the Lynch case is a clear instance of the complete wiping out of what Mr. Justice Brandéis, in his opinion for the Court, called “vested rights.” 292 U. S., at 577. Insofar as the 1954 Act applied to the earlier Darlington mortgage, it did not completely wipe out “vested rights.” But on the proper construction of § 608, in the circumstances found by the District Court and not here challenged, the unavoidable application of the 1954 Act to the Darlington mortgage did substantially impair the “vested rights” of respondent. I would be less than respecting the full import of the Lynch case did I not apply it to the present situation.
Accordingly, I join Mr. Justice Harlan's opinion.

After the hearing, the Court decides that United cannot change its rates without first obtaining written agreement from the buyer. However, in order to do so, the company must file new rate plans with the federal power commission and keep them open for inspection. This means that United can make rate changes at any time during the contract term. It also means that the natural gas companies have the right to adjust their prices as it sees fit.

5960,9421743,105825,020lead,"In this paper, Justice Frankfurter argues that the Constitution's provisions for federal courts to have original jurisdiction over all cases of civil nature or in equity arise under Article III. He also discusses the history of maritime law and the proposed amendments to the Jones Act as well as some of the other laws passed by Congress. The Court dismisses four different corporate defendants -- Com-pasia Trasatlaántica, Garcia & Diz, Inc; Quin Lumberco. New York corporations; and International Terminal Operating Company, Delaware corporations -- for lack of general maritime law because they are not diverse citizens. The court dismissed the claims against them because of their lack of ""compaa tramsatlantica"" and ""com-paniatrasatllantica."" The district judge declined jurisdiction even though it was decided that Romero did not work and control the ship at the time its injury occurred. Although the plaintiffs were Spanish citizens, the claim does not fall under the Jones act. The District Judge dismissed the complaint on grounds that there was no sufficient diversity under Strawbridge V. Cranch 257. The case is appealed to the Supreme Court after the last term has passed. The question of whether the petitioner asserts an independent claim within the definition of admiraltiness and maritime jurisdiction lies with the question of how the suit should be adjudicted. The Federal District Court had power to decide upon the merits of the claim. It was settled that the claim must be brought before a jurisponder who determines whether the claim is established in law or in fact. The decision made by the First Judicial Act of 1878 allows the lower federal judiciary to bring charges from state courts when the parties are diverse citizenship. This means that suits can be brought in both states and federal courts. However, these cases do not involve any disputes between the two branches of government. Since the Judichary Act granted exclusive original compétence of all civil cases of admirtaly and maritimejurisdiction, the only claim available in the federal court is for a seaman's right to common law remedies. The provision affords the ability of the States through the ""saving clause"" to save suitors the right to seek commonlaw remedies where the common Law is competent to provide it. Thus, the new constitution grants the federal courts authority to deal with cases of commerce which relate to the Constitution or the laws of United States",1959-04-06,1.0
5961,9421744,105825,040dissent,"
Mr. Justice Black,
dissenting.
Although this case has aroused much discussion about the scope of jurisdiction under 28 U. S. C. § 1331,1 cannot feel that the issue is either complex or earth-shaking. The real core of the jurisdictional controversy is whether a few more seamen can have their suits for damages passed on by federal juries instead of judges. For the reasons stated by Mr. Justice Brennan here and by Judge Magruder in Doucette v. Vincent, 194 F. 2d 834, 839, I believe that federal jurisdiction under 28 U. S. C. § 1331 lies and a federal jury trial is proper. In particular I feel that technical or esoteric readings should not be given to congressional language which is perfectly understandable in ordinary English.
Much the same reason leads me also to dissent from Part II of the Court's opinion. By its terms the Jones Act applies to “any seaman who shall suffer personal injury in the course of his employment.” 41 Stat. 1007, 46 U. S. C. § 688. (Italics added.) This Court in Lauritzen v. Larsen, 345 U. S. 571, held that the words “any seaman” did not include foreign seamen sailing foreign ships and injured in foreign waters. I dissented from that holding. It was based, I thought, on the Court’s concepts of what would be good or bad for the country *389internationally rather than on an actual interpretation of the language of the Jones Act. Thus, it seemed to me that the Lauritzen holding rested on notions of what Congress should have said, not on what it did say. Such notions, weak enough in Lauritzen, seem much weaker still in this case where the tort involved occurred in our own waters. I cannot but feel that, at least as to torts occurring within the United States, Congress knew what it was doing when it said “any seaman” and I must dissent from today’s further and, I believe, unjustifiable reduction in the scope of the Jones Act. Moreover since the tort occurred in the navigable waters of the United States, I think the complaint against Compania Trasatlántica stated a good cause of action under general maritime law whether jurisdiction of the cause is based, as I believe, on 28 U. S. C. § 1331, or, as the Court assumes, on some theory of “pendent jurisdiction.”
Mr. Justice Douglas joins in the first paragraph of this opinion. He believes that Lauritzen v. Larsen, 345 U. S. 571, is inapposite to the present case, because of the numerous incidents connecting this transaction with the United States. He therefore agrees with Mr. Justice Black that the District Court should take jurisdiction over petitioner’s claim against Compania Trasatlántica.

Mr. Justice Whittaker,
with whom Mr. Justice Stewart joins, dissenting.
I cannot agree. Let me very briefly put the case in perspective, as I see it. Taxation of the property of appellant’s Virginia subsidiary, which does an intrastate business in Virginia, is not at all involved here. The Court properly observes the fact that “Appellant’s Virginia business is ... of an exclusively interstate nature.” In the year involved it owned in Virginia tangible real and personal property which was taxed by Virginia under other statutes and is not involved in this case. Virginia also claims that appellant had intangible property in Virginia. It is upon those intangibles, so claimed to have been present in the State, that Virginia sought to lay its “franchise tax,” said by it to be a “property tax” measured by appellant’s gross receipts, allocable to Virginia, from “exclusively” interstate commerce. Admittedly appellant had a bank account and some “rolling stock” in Virginia, upon which, doubtless, Virginia validly could lay an ad valorem tax. But the dispute is over the following. Virginia claims that appellant should be deemed to have *449had in Virginia, and subject to the taxing statute here involved, substantially that percentage of the value of its national “good will,” and of its exclusive express carriage contract with the railroads, which the ratio of the mileage of carriers which it uses in interstate commerce in Virginia bears to the total mileage of the same carriers which it uses everywhere in such commerce. Appellant contends that Virginia’s claim in these respects is unconstitutional. Which of them is right? I think it is appellant. I think so for two reasons. First, the exclusive carriage contract which appellant has with the railroads requires it, as the Court observes, to pay “all of its net income” to the railroads. Therefore, as a matter of both fact and law, that contract can have no dollar value to appellant, distinguished from the railroads, to be taxed to it anywhere. Second, appellant’s “good will,” if any, does not consist of anything localized in Virginia, but inheres solely in its “exclusively” interstate business — a business that Virginia cannot reach or regulate, by direct taxation or otherwise, because it is prohibited from doing so by the Commerce Clause of the Constitution, Art. I, § 8, cl. 3. My views on that subject are fully stated in my dissenting opinion in No. 12, Northwestern States Portland Cement Co. v. Minnesota, and No. 33, Williams v. Stockham Valves & Fittings, Inc., post, at p. 477. I would therefore reverse the judgment of the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia.

The argument that § 214 requires the payment of money or other thing of value be made to the person who is to use his influence “to procure” an “appointive office” is not frivolous. The legislative history shpws that that was one of the evils against which Congress acted. But I am also convinced that Congress moved against the other evil as well — payment to a political party for the use of “influence to procure any appointive office.” The abuse in appointing postmasters during the Coolidge administration was the occasion for the law; and then as now (if the allegations in the information are to be *263believed) payments for those offices sometimos went to the party, sometimes to a politician. As Congressman Stevenson, who later'introduced the measure in the House, said in answering a question as to who gets the money paid for “the appointive office”:

The words used in § 214 are broad enough to include both evils. ‘
I have sometimes felt, as my dissents show (see United States v. Classic, 313 U. S. 299, 331; Rosenberg v. United States, 346 U. S. 273, 310; United States v. A & P Trucking Co., 358 U. S. 121, 127), that the Court has not always' construed a criminal'statute so as to resolve doubts in favor of the citizen. But that principle — as highly preferred as any in a government of laws — does no service here. To.hold the conduct charged in this, information outside the Act is to find ambiguities and doubts not obvious on -the face of the legislation, nor justifiably imputed from the legislative history. The inclusion in the original version of § 215 of limiting words can indicate no more, than that Congress intended a narrower scope for that section than for § 214. It does not show that § 214 was to be similarly narrowed.
Accordingly I join the opinion of the Court.

It is not supported by the Court, however, because it does not state that Congressman would have received anything direct or tangible benefit from receiving money from the Republican Party; rather, the Court believes that the term ""thing of value"" must be broad enough to embrace all kinds of inducements. The first problem facing the Court is whether the terms ""thingof value"" are sufficiently broad to embrace any acts which might constitute some kind of inducement to one who makes the offer. The law was originally written as a punishment for purchasing and selling public offices. In 1948, Congress passed a section called ""the merchant,"" meaning someone who had influence over the purchaser. This section became known as the ""use of influence,"" in the context of political donations.

The House and Senate passed a bill that allowed the individual employer to choose whether to accept or reject the checkoff arrangement.

The term ""invoice"" is defined as a written account memorandUM, list or catalog which is issued to any commercial dealings in fur products and contains the details of any furproducts or furs shipped or delivered to anyone who is engaged into dealing commercially with fur products/furs. The terms of the Act are vague: ""A fur product is falsely labeled."" ""Where applicable, thatthe product contains used fur,"" ""containing bleached dyed or else artificiallycolored fur;"" ""the name and addresses of the person selling the invoice; and --f) the Country of origin of all imported furs."" The Act also provides that misbranded furs must be clearly labelled on the product's label. The Court dismisses the charges against misbrandering because it found that there was not evidence that the label was deficient in three of these categories. The court then finds that the labels did not comply with the six required information under the Act. It appeals to the House of Representatives for further action. First, we discuss the purpose of the bill, which was to protect consumers against deception. Second, the definition of ""Invoice"" refers to a printed account and note. This includes a sales slip. The last phrase in the Act allows only one person to engage in dealing business in fur-related activities. Thus, even if Congress wanted to protect people from misleading advertisements, it would have to interpret the provisions so that they apply only to retail purchases. Finally, the act does not require merchants to give their customers a proper invoice. Instead, the purchaser receives a clear record of the entire transaction.

Peter's answer to the charges is granted by the Secretary on September 2, 1954. After having unsuccessfully obtained reinstatement by demand upon the secretary, petitioner file suit in the U.S. district court for declaration that his dismissedal had been unlawful and ineffective, and an injuction requiring him reinstatement.

Mr. Justice Brennan,

A District Court’s abstention from the exercise of its properly invoked jurisdiction is justified, in my view, “only in the exceptional circumstances where the order to the parties to repair to the state court would clearly serve one of two important countervailing interests: either the avoidance of a premature and perhaps unnecessary decision of a serious federal constitutional question, or the avoidance of the hazard of unsettling some delicate balance in the .area of federal-state relationships.” Louisiana Power & Light Co. v. City of Thibodaux, ante, p. *22632 (dissenting opinion). Both of these circumstances in which abstention is justified are present in this case. If the District Court directs the parties to the Pennsylvania courts, those"" courts may interpret the cutting off of access rights as a taking of property requiring the payment of compensation under Pennsylvania law. Such an interpretation would obviate any need-for determination of the serious constitutional issue, raised in the District Court.
Furthermore, the District Court’s action has halted at the threshold the carrying out of a large-scale highway program before the state courts have had an opportunity to interpret the statute creating that -program. This constitutes an unnecessary interference with state domestic policy creating undesirable friction in federal-state relationships.
Therefore, I concur in the judgment of the Court.

Plenary consideration of this case, and indeed the opinion of the majority o'f this Court, have made it clear that the Court of Appeals dealt with the factual issues, involved on the basis of a concession by the respondent and the jury’s answer to Interrogatory No. 1. ' It is therefore'now apparent that this case presents no. question concerning the classification of these issues as for the court or for the jury under the decision in Byrd v. Blue Ridge Rural Cooperative, Inc., 356 U. S. 525, and that the premise on which we granted certiorari was accordingly a mistaken one. And whether or not the Court of Appeals in acting as it did was correct, in .its assessment of the trial record is certainly not a matter justifying the exercise of .our certiorari power within the criteria of Rule 19. I therefore agree with my Brother Frankfurter that the writ of certiorari should be dismissed as improvidently granted, and join in his dissenting opinion.
Even if a Byrd issue could be considered as properly presented, the most that should be done is to remand the *286case to the Court of Appeals for further consideration in light of that decision. A retrial of this case would be justified under Byrd only if the Pennsylvania practice treating factual issues under § 104 of. the Workmen’s Compensation Act as for the court, instead of for the jury, see Persing v. Citizens Traction Co., 294 Pa. 230, 144 A. 97; Vescio v.

Mr. Justice Black,
with whom The .Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Douglas and Mr. Justice Brennan concur, dissenting.
In re Groban, 352 U. S. 330, decided two years ago, upheld as constitutional the action of a state fire marshal in compelling persons suspected of burning a building to testify about the fire in secret and without benefit of the presence of their counsel. Four of us dissented on the ground that such secret inquisitions violated the Due *299Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. In this case the Court upholds the action of a state judge in compelling testimony from persons suspected of getting statements of defendants in negligence cases under false pretenses and later “tampering” with these statements.* I think it violates due process for a judge no less than for a fire marshal to compel testimony to be given incommunicado. In fact it was Star Chamber judges who helped to make closed-door court proceedings so obnoxious in this country that the Bill of Rights guarantees public trials and the assistance of counsel. And secretly compelled testimony does not lose its highly dangerous potentialities merely1 because it represents only a “preliminary inquisition . . . whereby the court is given-information that may move it to other acts thereafter.” Nor does this record justify a holding that this.inquisition ádopted the mantle of secrecy and barred counsel from the room out of tender solicitude for the reputation of the defendants in this contempt case. Doubtless the defendants’ lawyer and the defendants themselves are at least as capable and perhaps as much interested in saving their reputations as the judge who is sending them to jail.
The naked, stark issue here is whether ajjudge j who must actually try cases in public — or any other government official for that matter — can consistently with due process compel persons to testify and perhaps to lay the groundwork for their later conviction of crime, in secret chambers, where counsel for the State can be' present but where counsel for the suspect cannot. In upholding such secret inquisitions the Court once again retreats from what I conceive to be its highest duty, that of maintaining *300unimpaired the rights and liberties guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment and the Bill of Rights. Cf. Bartkus v. Illinois, 359 U. S. 121; Frank v. Maryland, 359 U. S. 360; Barenblatt v. United States, ante, p. 109; Uphaus v. Wyman, ante, p. 72. Here as in Groban my answer would be that no public official can constitutionally exercise such a dangerous power over any individual. I would therefore reverse this conviction.

 Despite the judge’s repeated statements that these persons were' “witnesses” not defendants, the statement of a member of the judge’s inquiry staif, set out in note 12 of the Court’s opinion, makes it clear that they were suspected and under investigation for criminal conduct.

What has been written on both sides of this case makes appropriate a further word from one who concurs in the judgment of the Court; but cannot join its opinion.
Unlike my brother Clark who finds this case “both clear and simple,” I consider the constitutional issue ■•’it presents most difficult and far-reaching. In my view the Court quite properly declines to decide it in the present posture of the case. My unwillingness to subscribe to the ..Court’s opinion is due to the fact that it unnecessarily deals with the very issue it disclaims deciding. For present purposes no more need be said than that we should not be drawn into deciding the .. constitutionality of the' security-clearance revocation procedures employed in' this case until the use' of such procedures in matters of this kind has been deliberately considered and expressly authorized by the Congress or the President who alone are in a position to evaluate' in the first instance the totality of factors bearing upon the necessity for their use. That much the courts are entitled to before they are asked to express a constitutional judgment upon an issue fraught with such important • consequences both to the Government and the citizen.
"" Ample justification for abstaining from a constitutional decision at this stage of the case is afforded by the Court’s traditional and wise rule of not reaching constitutional issues unnecessarily or prematurely. That rule indeed has been consistently followed by this Court when faced with “confrontation” issues in .other security or loyalty cases. See Peters v. Hobby, 349 U. S. 331; Vitarelli v. Seaton, 359 U. S. 535; cf. Service v. Dulles, 354 U. S. 363; Kent v. Dulles, 357 U. S. 116. Adherence to that rule is, , as I understand it, the underlying basis of today’s decision, and it is on that basis that I join the judgment of the Court.
*510It is regrettable that my brother Clark should have so far yielded to the temptations of colorful characterization as to depict the issue in this case as being whether a citizen has “a constitutional right to have access to the Government’s military secrets,” and to suggest that the Court’s action today requires “the President’s Cabinet members to revoke their refusal to give” the petitioner “access to military , secrets,” despite any views they may have as to his reliability. Of course this decision involves no such issue or consequences. The basic constitutional issue is not whether petitioner is entitled to access to classified material, but rather whether, the particular procedures here employed to deny clearance on security grounds were constitutionally permissible; With good reason we do not reach that issue as matters now stand. And certainly there is nothing in the Court’s opinion which suggests that petitioner must be given access to classified material.

I heartily join the Court’s opinion. But I derive no pleasure from implying, contrary to the views of my' Brothers in the minority, that there was such complete want of evidence of negligence by respondent that “rea*142sonable men” could not differ about it, for, at the very least, I regard my Brothers who dissent as reasonable men.
Notwithstanding this, it seems to me that the facts of this case make it crystal clear that the Court’s opinion lacks not a whit in fully comporting with the standards of care of the mythical “reasonable man,” for, like the Ohio Court of Appeals, I simply cannot see any substantial evidence — or even a scintilla or an iota of evidence— of negligence on the part of respondent that caused, or directly .contributed in any degree to cause, petitioner’s unfortunate injury.
Reduced to substance, the simple facts are that petitioner, a crossing flagman, while standing in a'well-lighted intersection alongside a passing train in the nighttime and swinging a lighted red lantern in each hand, was struck, knocked down and run over by a drunken driver. What, I ask, did respondent do or omit that caused or contributed to cause that casualty? How could it have prevented the casualty? Petitioner says that respondent failed to provide him with “enough protection.” About the only way, as I perceive, that respondent could protect its crossing flagmen against injury from such lawless conduct by third persons would be to provide them with military tanks and make sure they stay in them while within or moving about crossing-intersections in the performance of their duties — and I am not even sure that this method, though ironclad, would be certain protection to a flagman against lawless injury by third persons, for someone might shoot him, an act not very different, it seems to me, from the drunken driver’s conduct which injured petitioner in this case, and for which injuries he insists, and four members of this Court agree, a jury should be permitted to require respondent to pay damages. How this can be thought to square with any known concept of “negligence” by respondent is beyond me.

6146,105993,105993,010combined,"In this brief, the Court examines Article 5248 -- Texas's tax code -- which imposes taxes on privately held property owned by lessees only. Phillips is engaged in the commercial manufacturing of ammonium on federal property leased to the Federal Government from the State for 15 years. The lease has a right to terminate after 30 days' notice in case of national emergency or 180 days' time in the event that a sale occurs. This lease was originally granted to the Dumas Independent school district under the military leasing act of 1947. However, it reserved to the government the right to stop collecting the tax upon 30 days and before 180 days in order to sell the property. When the lease was first assessed, Phillips had appealed to the state courts but the Supreme Court found the District's right tolevy the entire amount of the fee as unconstitutional. Article 5348, however, provides for an exception to the general taxation of land and improvements ""held,owned, used and consumed by the United states"" for public purposes: ""any portion of such lands and improvement which is used/occupied by any persons, firm,association of persons or corporations in its personal capacity or which is been used or occupying in the conductof any private business; or which are being used or occupation in the conducting any domestic business or enterprise shall be subject To taxation by these States and its political divisions."" Article 5272, however--which does not require a tax--is less burdensome because it allows the owner to pay only the price of the lease hold. It also allows the lessee to have a longer term than three years without paying a heavy tax. Although all lessee who hold tax exempt property under one year or more can do so, they cannot be treated differently due to the fact that their lease is subject to a higher tax burden than those of other classes. Because both classes share the same property, there seems to be no difference in the tax burden between them. For example, the State could collect rent what it lost in taxes from her lessee while the Federal Gov's lessee would not be able to collect rent from his lessee. Furthermore, since the State may legally foster its own interest by adopting reasonable measures to facilitate the Leasing of its property, even though some of the local governments lose in taxes through the use of similar leasing activities, the distinction between the two groups is clear.",1960-02-23,2.0

I join the Court’s opinion but desire to add a word. Mr. Justice Clark’s clear, full, and accurate statement of the facts demonstrates errors by nearly everyone having to do with the .case in the lower courts except the Government; yet it lost the case on appeal.
*429Petitioner, though not charged by the indictment with a “subsidiary conspiracy,” nevertheless asked, and induced the court to give in his very words, a charge to the jury saying that unless they found a “subsidiary conspiracy” they should acquit him. There being neither charge in the indictment nor evidence in the record of “subsidiary conspiracy,” the requested and obtained charge to the jury amounted to a virtual direction to acquit. And if the jury, in obedience to that charge, had acquitted, its verdict would, of course, have ended the case. Therefore, petitioner, by requesting and inducing the court to give this erroneous charge, got much more than he was entitled to under the law. Yet, he claimed in the Court of Appeals that this very charge, because unsupported by evidence, was erroneous and required an outright reversal. The Court of Appeals, though finding adequate evidence to support the indictment, first took that view. It seems plain to me that petitioner, having asked and obtained an erroneous but far more favorable charge than he was entitled to, certainly invited the error, benefited by it, and surely may not be heard to attack it as prejudicial to him; especially when, as seems quite plain, it was prejudicial only to the Government. I realize there is no profit in decrying a spent transaction, but I cannot resist observing the obvious, namely, that in these circumstances, the law required affirmance of the judgment.
After the Court of Appeals had written its original opinion reversing, the Government, in an effort to salvage the case, timely moved for a rehearing, saying, in effect: “Perhaps, we were in error in not objecting to the charge requested by the accused, and given by the court to the jury, on ‘subsidiary conspiracy/ but we should at least have an opportunity to retry the case.” The Court of Appeals then agreed with the Government's forced contention, and accordingly modified its opinion and remanded the case for a new trial. Petitioner complains *430of. this, urging that the court’s original opinion “acquitted” him, and that to try him again would violate the Fifth Amendment’s prohibition against double jeopardy. That contention, it seems to me, is totally devoid of merit. The Court of Appeals rendered but one judgment in the case, and it was one remanding for a new trial. Petitioner, instead of complaining that he was given only a new trial, should be thankful that his conviction was not affirmed.

Mr. Justice Black,

dissenting.
Section 1028.1 of the California Code, as here applied, provides that any California public employee who refuses to incriminate himself when asked to do so by a Congressional Committee “shall be suspended and dismissed from his employment in the manner provided by law.” The Fifth Amendment, which is a part of the Bill of Rights, provides that no person shall be compelled to incriminate (“to be a witness against”) himself. The petitioner, Globe, an employee of the State of California, appeared before the House Un-American Activities Committee of the United States Congress and claimed this federal constitutional privilege. • California promptly discharged him, as the Court’s opinion says, for “insubordination and violation of § 1028.1 of the Code.” The “insubordination and violation” consisted exclusively of Globe’s refusal to testify before the Congressional Committee; a ground for his refusal was that his answers might incriminate him. It is beyond doubt that the State took Globe’s job away from him only because he claimed his privilege under the Federal Constitution.
*10Here, then, is a plain conflict between the Federal Constitution and § 1028.1 of the California Code. The Federal Constitution told Globe he could, without penalty, refuse to incriminate himself before any arm of the Federal Government; California, however, has deprived him of his job solely because he exercised this federal constitutional privilege. In giving supremacy to the California law, I think the Court approves a plain violation of Article VI of the Constitution of the United States which makes that Constitution “the supreme Law of the Land . . . any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.” I also think that this discharge under state law is a violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment in its authentic historical sense: that a State may not encroach upon the individual rights of people except for violation of a law that is valid under the “law of the land.” “Law of the land” of necessity includes the supreme law, the Constitution itself.
The basic purpose of the Bill of Rights was to protect individual liberty against governmental procedures that the Framers thought should not be used. That great purpose can be completely frustrated by holdings like this. I would hold that no State can put any kind of penalty on any person for claiming a privilege authorized by the Federal Constitution. The Court’s holding to the contrary here does not bode well for individual liberty in America.

He was found guilty of two counts: 1) having purchased, sold,dispensed, and distributed the same nicarcotics; and 2) having ""facilitated the concealation and sale of"" the same drugs. The Court grants petitioner's motion for suppressance on the grounds that there was no probable cause to believe the existence of evidence necessary to make the search warrant valid. However, the court does not find sufficient cause to grant the motion. It is decided that petitioner must have been aggrievated by an unlawful searched and seizurre in order to be entitled to relief from the charges. A party who challenges a search may seek to suppress evidence at trial or hearing. If the accused has standing, it is easier for the government to use the evidence against him than to try to establish his own innocence. This dilemma arises because courts have held that only possession of the property can confer standing. Thus, even if the accused did not possess the property searched, he would still be subject to the penalty of seven years' imprisonment. Here, however, the question of whether Didone had sufficient evidence to issue the search arrest warrant is presented.

After six months, the Local loses membership and begins to conduct peaceful picketting at the customers' entrance to the store. In November 1956, the local draws a new line outside the store so that no one can enter without being forced to do so. A complaint against the Local was filed after only nine members had left their jobs during the strike.

Prior to expiration of 28 years, Black assigned his renewal rights to Peti* 374tioner in consideration of specific royalties and sum of $1,000; Black had no wives or children, and his next three brothers executed like assignments of his renewal expectations. The court decided that one of the brothers would be the executor of Black's will and renewed his copyright for an additional 28 years. Peti1s question is whether by law the author of the song can obtain the copyright when he dies without a will. Section 24 of the copywriting act states that the author may renew his work for another term of 21 years after which he must make an assignment. If the author does not have a wife or child, then his estate is left to his nieces and nephews. In order to determine whether this assignment is valid, the author must have died prior to the period of 18 years before the date of the renewal. This means that if the writer has only made an assignment during his lifetime, it cannot be invalid because he did not have an expectancy as to how long he should live. Thus, even though the author was alive at the beginning of the new term, his death prevents him from making any assignment. Finally, Congress creates a class of people who are entitled to renew rights under  24: widows, Widowers, Children, and Next of Kin. These classes include those who are living, but also those who have already been assigned their copyrights. They all fall into the same category since they were first assigned. However, we do not know why Congress created such a group of people. It seems that there might be a difference between the hierarchy of people given the right to renew with respect to the author-if living, the widow/women, or children.

We find nothing in our examination of the record to justify the denial of hearing on these allegations. The judgment is therefore vacated and the case is remanded for a hearing thereon.

Therefore, the case is dismissed. The Congress had originally intended to waive tax on ""real property"" owned by financial institutions in order to support economic recovery efforts. Thus, the government was concerned that it would lose its status as a tax collector even though it became part of the public entity. After World War I, Congress extended the function of the Reconstruct Finance Corporation to include the production of war materials. On May 29, 1946 after the war, the ReConstruct Finance declared the property to be excess to their needs and duties. This declaration transferred to the War Administration the functions: care for and handle the property awaiting disposal; making disposition of all necessary documents incident to transfer deed; and power of execution/delivery all necessary papers incidents to transfer title. All funds resulting from such disposition will be covered up in the United States Treasurable Receipts. The lease describes the lessor's name as the Reconstruct Finance Corporation and the United American, both acting through and through the general services administrator under the Sur plus property act of 1944.

  Per Curiam.
 

  The motion for leave to proceed
  
   in forma pauperis
  
  is granted. The petition for a writ of certiorari is also granted. Petitioner, a prisoner in an Ohio penitentiary, filed an application for a writ of habeas corpus in the District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. Among other claims, the petitioner alleged that the Ohio Supreme Court did not provide him, as an indigent criminal defendant, an adequate remedy for the prosecution of an appeal from his conviction without payment of docket fees. This deficiency was urged, as we read this lay petitioner’s informal
  
   pro se
  
  application for the writ, as a violation of the Federal Constitution’s guarantee of the equal protection of the laws. See
  
   Burns
  
  v.
  
   Ohio,
  
  360
   
   *193
   
  U. S. 252. The writ of habeas corpus was in effect denied by the District Court, that court denying petitioner, for want of merit, leave to proceed
  
   in forma pauperis
  
  before it. The District Court further denied a motion for leave to appeal
  
   in forma pauperis
  
  and the Court of Appeals sustained this action on the renewal of the motion before it.
 

  We hold that petitioner’s allegations in the application for the writ made out a case of deprivation of his constitutional right to the equal protection of the laws by Ohio in respect to his appeal from the conviction in the criminal prosecution against him. Clearly federal habeas corpus is an appropriate remedy under these circumstances. See

   Burns
  
  as to the validity of the former Ohio practice, and Ohio’s conformance, as we are advised, to the requirements of that decision, we think that the District Court should suspend a hearing on the writ for a reasonable time to allow petitioner to reapply to the Ohio Supreme Court for consideration of his appeal. Upon that court’s action thereon, the District Court should proceed, upon hearing, to make such appropriate order in the premises, as under the circumstances “law and justice require.” 28 U. S. C. § 2243. It may at that time consider, in the posture in which the case then stands, petitioner’s other claims as to the constitutional adequacy of Ohio’s appellate procedure in respect of his original conviction and his application for state collateral relief. To this end, the judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded to the District Court.

I agree with the Court that it ivas not clearly erroneous for the Tax Court to find as it did in No. 376 that the automobile transfer to Duberstein was not a gift, and so *294I agree with the Court’s opinion and judgment reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeals in that case.
I dissent in No. 546, Stanton v. United States. The .District Court found that the $20,000 transferred to Mr. Stanton by his former employer at the end of ten years’ service was a gift and therefore exempt from taxation under I. R. C. of 1939, § 22 (b) (3) (now I. R. C. of 1954, § 102 (a)). I think the finding was not clearly erroneous and that the Court of Appeals was therefore wrong in reversing the District Court’s judgment. While conflicting inferences might have been drawn, there was evidence to show that Mr. Stanton’s long services had been satisfactory, that he was well liked personally and had given splendid service, that the employer was under no obligation at all to pay any added compensation, but made the $20,000 payment because prompted by a genuine desire to make him a “gift,” to award him a “gratuity.” Cf. Commissioner v. LoBue, 351 U. S. 243, 246-247. The District Court’s finding was that the added payment “constituted a gift to the taxpayer, and therefore need not have been reported by him as income . . . The trial court might have used more words, or discussed the facts set out above in more detail, but I doubt if this would have made its crucial, adequately supported finding any clearer.

Mr. Justice Harlan,
concurring in the result.
In joining the judgment in this case I shall refer only to one matter which, among the voluminous data presented by the parties, is for me by far the most telling in favor of the Government’s position.
Treasury Regulation 77, promulgated in 1933 under the Revenue Act of 1932 (47 Stat. 169), defined the basic term “gross income from the property” contained in §114 (b)(4) of the 1932 Act and carried forward in its successors. Art. 221 (g). It concededly supports, by its express terms (see ante, p. 83), the position of the Government in the present case. In my opinion the regulation was undoubtedly a valid exercise of the Commissioner’s power to construe a generally worded statute. See Preliminary Report on Depletion, Staff Reports to the Joint Committee on Internal Revenue Taxation (1930), p. 68 (Shepherd Report); Helvering v. Wilshire Oil Co., 308 U. S. 90, 102-103. The Revenue Act of 1943 (58 Stat. 21, 45), which added to the 1939 Code the provisions governing this' case, represented only a limited departure from the 1933 Regulation, or from the administrative action taken under it, principally in the area of extractive processes applied to minerals not customarily sold in the form of a crude product, and did not basically affect the meaning of the term “gross income from the property.” See, e. g., Revenue Act of 1943, Hearings before the Senate Committee on Finance, 78th Cong., 1st Sess., on H. R. 3687, pp. 527-529; S. Rep. No. 627, 78th *91Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 23-24; Revenue Revision of 1942, Hearings before the House Committee on Ways and Means, 77th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 1202; compare id., at 1199; Silver, Hearings before the Senate Special Committee on the Investigation of Silver, 77th Cong., 2d Sess., pursuant to S. Res. 187 (74th Cong.), pp. 761-764. Respondent’s efforts to impugn the force of that Regulation, see Shepherd Report, supra, at 70, 71; Revenue Revisions, 1947-1948, Hearings before the House Committee on Ways and Means, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 3283; Mineral Treatment Processes for Percentage Depletion Purposes, Hearings before the House Committee on Ways and Means, 86th Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 258, 264, seem to me quite unpersuasive.
This history, in my view, provides an authoritative and controlling gloss upon the term “commercially marketable mineral product or products” in the statutory definition of “mining,” which in turn constitutes the “property” with which the statute deals. See Helvering v. Wilshire Oil Co., supra. It results, on this record, in limiting respondent’s basis for depletion to its constructive income from raw fire clay and shale.

6287,9422057,106101,020lead,"In this paper, Justice Clark argues that the allowance for salvage value of automobiles used as a rental or allied service is to be set aside according to a reasonable schedule. The cases in question relate to Evans's business where he leases new cars to his customers and sells them at a higher price than they actually cost. Because of the high demand for older cars, Evans found it more advantageous to sell these older cars to jobbers instead of selling them on the open market. However, the Commissioner denies depreciations on the basis that useful life is not the total economy of the automobile; rather, it is ""the total physical or economically life of the vehicles."" The Court of Appeal reverses the Commissioner's theory and finds that useful lives are measured by the period during use in the taxpayer's trade. This court furthermore dismisses the commissioner's claim that salvage value is only scrap because the vehicle is used for its entire economic life. Although the term ""useful life"" was originally intended to refer to property owned for the purpose of producing income, Congress later changed the definition so that it now refers to property held for production of money.",1960-06-27,2.0

He then turns to the question of whether the commissioner has established a new practice to the opposite end of the spectrum. Although Congress first used the term ""usefulness"" in 1913, it was never defined until the internal revenue code of 1956. It was only later that Congress changed the definition to ""wear and tear."" This meant that the term could not be used for depreciations as long as the asset was held in the same business for at least three years. However, the government had originally intended to use the phrase ""useable life"" when it said ""properties in the business."" Thus, the court does not believe that Congress meant to define useful life by simply saying that property should be subject to wear and tear. Instead, it means that the period of time during which an asset is physically exhausted must be considered as useful life; therefore, the courts do not think that Congress actually meant to say ""usefalage"" when talking about physical life.",1960-06-27,2.0

*159Mr. Justice Frankfurter,
concurring in the dissent.*
In joining Mr. Justice Harlan's opinion I should like to add a word by way of emphasis.
Once analysis of the problem of these two cases, relating as they do exclusively to independent producers of natural gas, is stripped of darkening details and reduced to its statutory determinants, as spelled out in my Brother Harlan's dissent, the answer becomes clear and uncomplicated. If a licensing agency has power to grant a particular kind of license, an applicant has the right to apply for such a license. It may be withheld without ado only if the agency has arbitrary — judicially unreviewable — power to withhold such a license. Concededly the Commission has power to grant a time-limited certificate, and its denial of such a certificate is not free from judicial review. Therefore it must give a reason for denying a proper application, with due regard, of course, to its wide discretionary power for determining what satisfies “public convenience and necessity.” The Commission cannot rest denial on its ipse dixit. Nor can the Commission rest on the general spirit or the ultimate purposes of the Natural Gas Act, for to do so amounts to saying that the Act forbids time certificates, when in fact it does not.

The court also dismisses an appeal by the State's Committee of State bar examiners to determine whether Konigsburg is a member and/or a political leader of the communist party. The majority believes that the First Constitution guarantees free speech and Association under the Articles. However, the majority does believe that the ""clear andpresent danger test"" used by Holmes and Brandeis must be relied upon because it can lead to dangerous ideas being adopted by the market. This means that the courts cannot interpret the First Amendment so as to protect freedom of speech or association. The only issue before the court is whether any right to speak or publish exist in the people who cannot be removed from the government without amending the Bill of rights. The first amendment was intended to protect individual liberty even against state invaders. The second amendment was meant to protect public safety when governments were not allowed to act according to their own principles. The Second Amendment was supposed to ensure that no person could express his views directly to his neighbors but instead would need to conform to the standards set forth by the legislature. The question here is whether the laws are constitutionally required to regulate speech. The answer is yes. The third argument presented by the majority is that the interests of the State are balanced against the interest of protecting individuals' freedoms. It is clear that the purpose of asking questions about such things as membership in the socialist party is to deny someone admission to the bar.

This judgment must be reversed even if we assume with Mr. Justice Traynor in his dissent in the California Supreme Court, 52 Cal. 2d 769, 774, at 776, 344 P. 2d 777, 780, at 781-782, that “a question as to present or past membership in [the Communist Party] is relevant to the issue of possible criminal advocacy and hence to [Konigsberg’s] qualifications.” The Committee did not come forward, in the proceeding we passed upon in 353 U. S. 252, nor in the subsequent proceeding, with evidence to show that Konigsberg unlawfully advocated the overthrow of the Government. Under our decision in Speiser v. Randall, 357 U. S. 513, the Fourteenth Amendment therefore protects Konigsberg from being denied admission to the Bar for his refusal to answer the questions. In Speiser we held that “. . . when the constitutional right to speak is sought to be deterred by a State’s general taxing program due process demands that the speech be unencumbered until the State comes forward with sufficient proof to justify its inhibition.” 357 U. S., pp. 528-529. “There may be differences of degree,” Mr. Justice Traynor said, “in the public interest in the fitness of the applicants for tax exemption and for admission to the Bar”; yet, as to the latter also, “Such a procedure is logically dictated by Speiser . . . .” 52 Cal. 2d, p. 776, 344 P. 2d, p. 782. And unless mere whimsy governs this Court’s decisions in situations im*81possible rationally to distinguish, such a procedure is indeed constitutionally required here. The same reason's apply. For Mr. Justice Traynor was entirely right in saying: “Whatever its relevancy [the question as to past or present Party' membership] in a particular context, ... it is an extraordinary variant of the usual inquiry into crime, for the attendant burden of proof upon any one under question poses the immediate threat of prior restraint upon the free speech of all applicants. The possibility of inquiry into their speech, the heavy burden upon them to establish its innocence, and the evil repercussions of inquiry despite innocence, would constrain them to speak their minds so noncommittally that no one could ever mistake their innocuous words for advocacy. This grave danger to freedom of speech could be averted without loss to legitimate investigation by shifting the burden to the examiners. Confronted with a prima facie case, an applicant would then be obliged to rebut it.” Id., p. 776, 344 P. 2d, p. 782.
The Court admits the complete absence of any such predicate by the Committee for its questions. The Court attempts to distinguish the situations in order to escape the controlling authority of Speiser. The speciousness of its reasoning is exposed in Mr. Justice Black's dissent. I would reverse.

*349Mr. Justice Whittaker,
concurring.
I concur in the Court’s judgment, but not in the whole of its opinion. It seems to me that the decision should be rested not on the Fifteenth Amendment, but rather on the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution. I am doubtful that the aver-ments of the complaint, taken for present purposes to be true, show a purpose by Act No. 140 to abridge petitioners’ “right ... to vote,” in the Fifteenth Amendment sense. It seems to me that the “right ... to vote” that is guaranteed by the Fifteenth Amendment is but the same right to vote as is enjoyed by all others within the same election precinct, ward or other political division. And, inasmuch as no one has the right to vote in a political division, or in a local election concerning only an area in which he does not reside, it would seem to follow that one’s right to vote in Division A is not abridged by a redistricting that places his residence in Division B if he there enjoys the same voting privileges as all others in that Division, even though the redistricting was done by the State for the purpose of placing a racial group of citizens in Division B rather than A.
But it does seem clear to me that accomplishment of a State’s purpose — to use the Court’s phrase — of “fencing Negro citizens out of” Division A and into Division B is an unlawful segregation of races of citizens, in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483; Cooper v. Aaron, 358 U. S. 1; and, as stated, I would think the decision should be rested on that ground — which, incidentally, clearly would not involve, just as the cited cases did not involve, the Colegrove problem.

I agree with the views expressed by Judge Moore in Diggs v. Commissioner, 281 F. 2d 326, 330-332, and by Judge Brown, writing for himself and Judge Hutcheson, in United States v. Bond, 258 F. 2d 577.
It is true that in this transaction the taxpayer was bound to lose if the annuity contract is taken by itself. At least the taxpayer showed by his conduct that he never intended to come out ahead on that investment apart from this income tax deduction. Yet the same may be true where a taxpayer borrows money at 5% or 6% interest to purchase securities that pay only nominal interest; or where, with money in the bank earning 3%, he borrows from the selfsame bank at a higher rate. His aim there, as here, may only be to get a tax deduction for interest paid. Yet as long as the transaction itself is not hocus-pocus, the interest charges incident to completing it would seem to be deductible under the Internal Revenue Code as respects annuity contracts made prior to March 1, 1954, the date Congress selected for terminating this class of deductions. 26 U. S. C. § 264. The insurance company existed; it operated under Texas law; it was authorized to issue these policies and to make these annuity loans. While the taxpayer was obligated to pay interest at the rate of 3%% per annum, the annuity bonds increased *371in cash value at the rate of only 2y2% per annum. The insurance company’s profit was in that 1-point spread.
Tax avoidance is a dominating motive behind scores of transactions. It is plainly present here. Will the Service that calls this transaction a “sham” today not press for collection of taxes* arising out of the surrender of the annuity contract? I think it should, for I do not believe any part of the transaction was a “sham.” To disallow the “interest” deduction because the annuity device was devoid of commercial substance is to draw a line which will affect a host of situations not now before us and which, with all deference, I do not think we can maintain when other cases reach here. The remedy is legislative. Evils or abuses can be particularized by Congress. We deal only with “interest” as commonly understood and as used across the board in myriad transactions. Since these transactions were real and legitimate in the insurance world and were consummated within the limits allowed by insurance policies, I would recognize them tax-wise.

Petitioners terminated this transaction in 1956 by allowing the bonds to be cancelled and receiving a check for $1,000. The termination was reflected in their tax return for 1956. It might also be noted that the insurance company reported as gross income the interest payments which it received from petitioners in 1953 and 1954.

The New Hampshire Supreme Court has held in this proceeding that the New Hampshire Legislature still wanted Dr. Uphaus’ answers on December 14, 1959, not*389withstanding the omission from Laws 1957, c. 178, of the provision of Laws 1955, cc. 340 and 197, authorizing the Attorney General “to determine whether subversive persons . . . are presently located within this state,” Wyman v. Uphaus, 102 N. H. 461, 159 A. 2d 160; on denial of motion for bail, 102 N. H. 517, 162 A. 2d 611. We are bound by the highest state court’s construction of the pertinent New Hampshire statutes. We must therefore consider the substantiality of the federal constitutional questions presented on this appeal on the basis of that construction and not upon the premise urged by Dr. Uphaus that the 1957 statute shows that the legislature-on December 14, 1959, no longer wanted him to produce the list of names. In consequence, while I remain of the view that the Court in Uphaus v. Wyman, 360 U. S. 72, incorrectly sustained the previous order of civil contempt made against Dr. Uphaus, see dissent at page 82, that holding, while it stands, also sustains the order challenged on this appeal.

  when requested to move- by the bailiff, refused to do so. The judge then summoned the petitioner to the bench and instructed him to be seated in the right-hand section of the courtroom, the section reserved for Negroes. The petitioner moved back in front of the counsel-table and remained standing with his arms folded, stating that he preferred standing and indicating that he would not comply with the judge’s order. Upon refusal to obey the judge’s further direction to be-seated, the petitioner was arrested for contempt.' At no time did he behave in a boisterous or abusive manner, and there was no disorder in the courtroom. The State,, in its Brief in Opposition filed in this Court, concedes that in the section of the Richmond Traffic Court reserved for spectators, seating space “is assigned on the basis of racial designation, the seats on one side of the aisle being for use off Negro citizens and the seats on the other side being for the use of white citizens.”
 

  It is clear from the totality of circumstances, and particularly the fact that the petitioner was peaceably seated in the section reserved for whites before being summoned tó the bench, that the ""arrest and conviction rested entirely on the refusal to comply with the segregated seating requirements imposed in this particular courtroom. Such a conviction cannot stand, for it is no longer open to question that .a State may not constitutionally require segregation of public facilities. See,
  
   e. g., Brown
  
  v.
  
   Board of Education,

   Parke, Davis & Co.,
  
  362 U. S. 29, 49. On remand, Parke Davis introduced evidence not to rebut the Government’s proof as to violation but only to show that it had abandoned its illegal sales policy, and that therefore an injunction, being unnecessary, should not issue. On that record the District. Court entered an order denying not only the injunctive relief sought by the Government, but also an adjudication that Parke Davis had violated the law. The present appeal is not from the provision which denies injunctive relief, but from the omission of a provision adjudging that Parke Davis violated the Act. We have examined the record as supplemented on the remand and hold that under our prior order the Government is entitled to a judgment on the merits, as prayed in paragraph 1 of the section of the Complaint captioned “Prayer.” We also hold that the District Court should retain the case on the docket for future action in the event the Government applies for further relief from an alleged resumption by Parke Davis of illegal activity. The order of the District Court filed July 18, 1960, is therefore vacated and the case is remanded to the District Court with direction to enter judgment accordingly.

dissenting.
The dismissal of the indictment in this case was placed squarely upon the district court’s construction of a criminal statute. Specifically, the court ruled that a loan of money did not fall within the prohibition of § 302 of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947 (before its amendment in 1959). In bringing the appeal directly here, the Government eliminated from the case any possible questions other than the correctness of the district court’s construction of the underlying statute — to which this Court’s jurisdiction is limited under the Criminal Appeals Act. 18 U. S. C. § 3731. United States v. Keitel, 211 U. S. 370, 397-398; United States v. Patten, 226 U. S. 525, 535, 540; United States v. Colgate & Co., 250 U. S. 300, 301, 306; United States v.

For ‘The Government’s appeal does not open the whole case.’ ” United States v. Petrillo, 332 U. S. 1, 5.
I think the issue whether a loan of money came within the proscriptions of the statute is before us now and should be decided. I further think this is the only issue properly before us. However, since the Court thinks otherwise, I am persuaded that an expression of my views on the subject would not be appropriate.

This case was brought here on a meager typewritten petition which invoked the Court’s certiorari jurisdiction on the claim that the North Carolina Supreme Court had disregarded controlling federal standards for determining the validity of a release from liability under the Federal Employers’ Liability Act. In reversing the North Carolina Supreme Court, this Court does not support the grounds on which review was urged. The oral argument dispelled such a claim and revealed, what the Court’s *164opinion now recognizes, that the conflict between' the state court and this Court turns on assessment of the trial testimony. This Court has repeatedly announced that the writ of certiorari is not to be employed to pass on matters of evidence and our Rule 19 formally bars such an obvious misuse of our discretionary jurisdiction. Again and again we deny petitions for certiorari which merely raise disputed issues of fact. Instead of making cases arising under the Federal Employers’ Liability Act an exceptional class, Congress in 1916 explicitly withdrew Federal Employers’ Liability cases from the Court’s obligatory jurisdiction. 39 Stat. 727. For reasons set forth at length in my dissenting opinion in Ferguson v. Moore-McCormack Lines, Inc., 352 U. S. 521, 524, I would dismiss this writ as improvidently granted. Doing so after argument has been had would serve to discourage petitions brought solely to review matters of evidence; to adjudicate the case on the merits by taking one view of the evidence as against another only encourages petitions that ought not to be filed here.

However, Douglas contends that Congress intends to give relief to people who are deprived of their rights by an official's abuse of power. He also discusses the provisions in the Civil Rights Bill, which were passed on April 20, 1870. It was intended to override some kinds of state law but provide a remedy for those who have been wrongfully entrusted with the responsibility of enforcing state laws. This bill did not afford a Federal right in federal Courts; instead, it afforded a federal Right in federal courts. Much of the legislation contained in the proposed bill was based on the concept that ""two or more persons"" could conspire together to do anything in violation of his rights. In addition, the definition of ""under color of State Law"" was narrower than the original version. Thus, the meaning given to this phrase has not changed.",1961-02-20,2.0

The court interprets the provision as meaninging that state laws may be violated without federal approval and that citizens may claim rights under the Fourteen-th Amendment. Although the legislative history suggests that Congress intended to afford judicial review of cases involving unconstitutionals, the court disagrees. It seems more likely that the legislature had intended to distinguish between state law enforcement and authorized actions than have the courts been allowed to do so. This argument is further supported by the fact that the Supreme Court has authority to review such cases. However, the narrow construction of the statute would reduce the constitution to having only a jurisdictionally function. If one attribute to the congress the view that an action deprivating a constitutional Right is significantly different than and more serious Than a violation Of a State Right, and therefore deserves another remedy, even though the act may constitute neither a state or a national tort, then the same act might deserve a different relief. Furthermore, since the Constitution forbids states from making or authorizing any law amending the due process clause, there is no need for civil remedies against individuals who violate their rights. Even if they were not legally authorized to perform illegal acts, the government could still intervene on behalf of those who committed them.",1961-02-20,2.0

Although the specific intent required by Screws was not explicitly stated in the bill, this fact does not deprive them of their constitutional rights. They are entitled to due process because they are ""implicit"" in the notion of ordered liberty. In order to prove their claims, they must show that they were acting under ""color of state authority."" Congress used the phrase ""under color"" only in the Civil Right Act of 1870 but also in several criminal provisions of the First civil rights act of April 9th, 1801, and 1866.

S. 129, while an electronic device that penetrates the wall, as here,'is not. Yet the invasion *513of privacy is as great in one case as in the other. The concept of “an unauthorized physical penetration into the premises,” on which the present decision rests, seems to me to be beside the point. Was not the wrong in both cases done when the intimacies of the home were tapped, recorded, or revealed? The depth of the penetration of the electronic device — even the degree of its remoteness from the inside of the house — is not the measure of the injury. There is in each such case a search that should be made, if at all, only on- a warrant issued by a magistrate. I stated my views in On Lee v. United States, 343 U. S. 747, and adhere to them. Our concern should not be with the trivialities of the local law of trespass, as the opinion of the Court indicates. But neither should the command of the Fourth Amendment be limited by nice distinctions turning on the kind of electronic equipment employed. Rather our sole concern should be with whether the privacy of the home was invaded. Since it was invaded here, and since no search warrant was obtained as required by the Fourth Amendment and Rule 41 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, I agree with the Court that the judgment of conviction must be set, aside.

  Petitioner, Mayor of the City of Aurora, brought this suit in the District Court against the City and certain of its officials for damages for deprivation of rights secured to him by the Constitution. He alleges unlawful action by the city and by individuals who are or who purport to be its officials (see 42 U. S. C. § 1983) and a conspiracy (see 42 U. S. C. § 1985). The District Court granted the motions to dismiss, 174 F. Supp. 794, and the Court of Appeals affirmed, 275 F. 2d 377, both decisions being prior to our opinion in
  
   Monroe

  . Accordingly we grant the petition for certiorari, affirm the judgment in favor of the City of Aurora, vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals in favor of the individual respondents and remand the cause as respects them to the Court of Appeals for reconsideration in light of this opinion.

The Second Court of Appeal reaffirmed this decision, finding that while the district judge may not find a flaw within the state court's records, he should consider the historical facts when making the necessary constitutional decisions.

Me. Justice Stewart,

dissenting.
Although the matter is not free from doubt, I accept the Court’s conclusion that both state courts gave some weight to the probable truth of the confessions in determining that they were voluntary.* But I cannot accept the proposition that the petitioner is entitled to his release by way of federal habeas corpus merely because of the state courts’ failure properly to verbalize the correct Fourteenth Amendment test of admissibility. Cf. Stroble v. California, 343 U. S. 181.
The writ can be extended to Rogers only if he is “in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States.” 28 U. S. C. § 2241 (c)(3). See Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U. S. 458, 465-468; Hawk v. Olson, 326 U. S. 271, 274-276. In the context of the present case this means that the writ should be granted, if, and *550only if, a coerced confession was in fact admitted at the trial. See Leyra v. Denno, 347 U. S. 556. I think, as did the District Court, that in deciding that question the appropriate inquiry for the habeas corpus court is not what test of admissibility the State applied or purported to apply, but whether a confession was admitted which was in fact involuntary under Fourteenth Amendment standards.
I would, therefore, remand the case to the District Court for a plenary hearing to determine this question. Where, as here, the state trial court’s determination of admissibility was at least partly affected by the impermissible factor of probable reliability, I think there can be no question of the federal court’s duty to hold such a hearing. While the state court’s failure to enunciate the correct standard was not itself an error of constitutional dimensions, it did make impossible the federal court’s unquestioning reliance on the trial court’s findings of fact. Even the most narrow view of what was said in Brown v. Allen, 344 U. S. 443, would require a plenary hearing in these circumstances.

In Connecticut the jury plays no part in determining the volun-tariness of a confession. Connecticut follows the orthodox rule of leaving the determination of admissibility exclusively to the trial judge. State v. McCarthy, 133 Conn. 171, 177, 49 A. 2d 594, 597; State v. Guastamachio, 137 Conn. 179, 182, 75 A. 2d 429, 431; State v. Lorain, 141 Conn. 694, 699, 109 A. 2d 504, 507. Compare Stein v. New York, 346 U. S. 156. If a confession is admitted, the jury is left to weigh its truthfulness as it weighs other evidence. There is no claim in this case of any error in the instructions to the jury.

If the 1,840 acres in question lay between low and high water, the United States by keeping the water level at the ordinary high-water contour would not in my view appropriate any private property. For that is use of the bed of the stream pursuant to the navigation servitude. Most of our cases deal with that. It was in that domain *637that United States v. Kansas City Ins. Co., 339 U. S. 799, arose.
If the 1,840 acres were a dam site, any of their value for such a purpose would be noncompensable within the ruling of United States v. Twin City Power Co., 350 U. S. 222. Dam-site value is water-power value. And the flow of the stream in its natural state or through a structure that is low or high provides “a head of water” (United States v. Willow River Co., 324 U. S. 499, 502) that often has great value. But when it is in a navigable stream, it is not a property right subject to private ownership and compensation under the Fifth Amendment. There is “no private property in the flow” of this navigable stream. United States v. Appalachian Power Co., 311 U. S. 377, 427.
Yet if the Federal Government builds a dam that raises the water above the ordinary high-water mark by a foot, by a hundred feet, or by five hundred feet, it asserts dominion over property not within its navigational servitude. As we said in United States v. Willow River Co., supra, 509, “High-water mark bounds the bed of the river. Lands above it are fast lands and to flood them is a taking for which compensation must be paid.”
It is in the latter domain that the present controversy lies. The flowage rights being condemned are rights to flood a part of the 1,840-acre tract that lies above the “usual water line” which I understand to mean land above the ordinary high-water mark.
Whatever may be the reason why this particular interest in the uplands was acquired, the owner stands in the shoes of his predecessor in title. The owner of the easement is entitled, as the Court holds, to no water-power value. The owner is, in other words, entitled to nothing that gains value from the flow of the stream, from any head of water, or from the strategic location of his land *638for hydroelectric development of the river. But the owner of the easement and the owner of the subservient fee have all the other parts of the bundle of rights that represent “property” within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment.
Hence, I join the opinion of the Court.

However, when the government decided to construct the new dam on these lands for its own advantage, it took the easement from the owner who had previously conveyed it. This means that at the time there was no way the power company would ever be able to use the easeement to flood these other lands.",1961-04-03,1.0

  During oral argument in this Court the Solicitor General suggested that the combination of circumstances in this case, beginning with one judge’s clearly expressed intention to impose a five-year sentence, and ending with another judge’s imposition of a twenty-year sentence under the indictment, was not consistent with that regularity and fairness which should characterize the administration of criminal justice in the federal courts. In the light of the Solicitor General’s suggestion, and upon an independent examination of the record, we have concluded that a due regard for the fair administration of justice requires that the convictions under counts 3, 4, and 5 of the indictment be set aside. 28 U.

The court dismisses the suit for want of Equity jurisdiction rather than on merit.

Mr. Justice Douglas
delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case involves a controversy that started in 1956 between petitioner Local 165 and the Worcester Telegram and between petitioner Local 38 and the Haverhill Gazette. The two unions insisted that the collective bargaining agreements that were being negotiated contain clauses or provisions to which each employer objected. The controversy as it reaches here is reduced to two clauses: first, that the hiring for the composing room be in the hands of the foreman; that he must be a member of the union; but that the union “shall not discipline the foreman for carrying out written instructions of the publisher or his representatives authorized by this Agreement” ; and second, that the General Laws of the International Typographical Union shall govern the relations between the parties if they are “not in conflict with state or federal law.” The unions’ demand that these clauses be included in the agreement led to a deadlock in the negotiations which in turn resulted in a strike.
The employers filed charges with the Board, complaints were issued, the cases consolidated, and hearings held. The Board concluded that the demands for the two clauses and the strikes supporting them were violations of the Act. It found that a demand for a contract that included those clauses was a refusal to bargain collectively within the meaning of § 8 (b) (3) of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended by the Taft-Hartley Act, 61 Stat. 136,140-141,29 U. S. C. §158 (b) (3). *707It found that striking to force acceptance of those clauses was an attempt to make the employers discriminate in favor of union members contrary to the command of § 8 (b) (2) of the Act. It also found that striking for the “foreman clause” was restraining and coercing the employers in the selection of their representatives for the adjustment of grievances in violation of §8 (b)(1)(B) of the Act. 123 N.

6414,9422174,106208,020lead,"The Delaware Court of Appeals dismisses the petition for declaratory judgment because it is not clear whether Eagle's refusal to service Negro violates the equal protection clause of the Four fourteenth Amendment. It is decided that Eagle'd be acting in ""a purely privately capacity"" under its lease, and therefore does not violate the Equal Proclamation Clause. However, the Supreme Court has held that this action was not directed at the Delaware Parking Authority but instead was directed at Eagle. On appeal from the judgment, the Court dismissells the claim as unconstitutional since the court did not consider the constitutional question of jurisdiction until after the hearing on merits. The authority was created pursuant to the Delaware Constitution by the city of Wilmington. In order to provide adequate public parking for the community, the state had granted wide powers to the authority including that of building or purchasing or condemnation; lands and property; and that of renting portions of any of their garage buildings or structure for commercial use. The Act provided that the rate and charges for such facilities must be reasonably determined solely by the authority for the purpose of providing for payment of the expense of the authority, the construction improvement, repairs, maintenance,and operation of its premises and properties,the payment of principal of and interests on its obligations and to fulfill all terms and provisions with the purchaser/holder of any such obligation or with the City. All property used by the entity is also exempt from State taxation. After the construction of a new car-parking building, the Delaware authorities were advised that the revenue would not be enough to finance the cost of the project. Therefore, they chose to enter long term leases with accountable tenants for commercial uses of some of those space available in downtown Wilmington where the tenant could rent out the entire building. This lease contained no requirement that the restaurant services be served on a strictly nondiscrimificial basis. Although the lease contains no provision for the general public to make access to the building without paying an annual rental fee, the courts have concluded that Eagle serves only as a private enterprise. They hold that Eagleacted in ""pure private capacity."" Thus, the court finds that Eagle was indeed acting in his own private capacity. Furthermore, the case falls on the principle that state involvement in private conduct is not necessarily limited to private conduct.",1961-04-17,2.0

I agree that the judgment must be reversed, but I reach that conclusion by a route much more direct than the one traveled by the Court. In upholding Eagle’s right to deny service to the appellant solely because of his race, the Supreme Court of Delaware relied upon a statute of that State which permits the proprietor of a restaurant to refuse to serve “persons whose reception or entertainment by him would be offensive to the major part of his customers . . . .” * There is no suggestion in the record that the appellant as an individual was such a person. The highest court of Delaware has thus construed this *727legislative enactment as authorizing discriminatory classification based exclusively on color. Such a law seems to me clearly violative of the Fourteenth Amendment. I think, therefore, that the appeal was properly taken, and that the statute, as authoritatively construed by the Supreme Court of Delaware, is constitutionally invalid.

Mr. Justice Frankfurter,
dissenting.
According to my brother Stewart, the Supreme Court of Delaware has held that one of its statutes, 24 Del. Code, § 1501, sanctions a restaurateur denying service to a person solely because of his color. If my brother is correct in so reading the decision of the Delaware Supreme Court, his conclusion inevitably follows. For a State to place its authority behind discriminatory treatment based solely on color is indubitably a denial by á State of the equal protection of the laws, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. My brother Harlan also would find the claim of invalidity of the statute decisive if he could read the state court's construction of it as our brother Stewart reads it. But for him the state court’s view of its statute is so ambiguous that he deems it necessary to secure a clarification from the state court of how in fact it did construe the statute.
I certainly do not find the clarity that my brother Stewart finds in the views expressed by the Supreme Court of Delaware regarding 24 Del. Code, § 1501. If I were forced to construe that court’s construction, I should find the balance of considerations leading to the opposite conclusion from his, namely, that it was merely declaratory of the common law and did not give state sanction to refusing service to a person merely because he .is colored. The Court takes no position regarding the statutory meaning which divides my brothers Harlan and Stewart. Clearly it does not take Mr. Justice Stewart’s view of what the Supreme Court of Delaware decided. *728If it did, it would undoubtedly take his easy route to decision and not reach the same result by its much more circuitous route.
Since the pronouncement of the Supreme Court of Delaware thus lends itself to three views, none of which is patently irrational, why is not my brother Harlan’s suggestion for solving this conflict the most appropriate solution? Were we to be duly advised by the Supreme Court of Delaware that Mr. Justice Stewart is correct in his reading of what it said, there would be an easy end to our problem. There would be no need for resolving the problems in state-federal relations with which the Court’s opinion deals. If, on the other hand, the Delaware court did not mean to give such an invalidating construction to its statute, we would be confronted with the problems which the Court now entertains for decision, unembarrassed by disregard of a simpler issue. This would involve some delay in adjudication. But the time would be well spent, because the Court would not be deciding serious questions of constitutional law any earlier than due regard for the appropriate process of constitutional adjudication requires.
Accordingly, I join in Mr. Justice Harlan’s proposed disposition of the case without intimating any view regarding the question, prematurely considered by the Court, as to what constitutes state action.

Certainly no decision in the Court’s history has been the progenitor of more lasting dissatisfaction and disharmony within a particular area of the law than Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen, 244 U. S. 205. The mischief it has caused was due to the uncritical application of the loose doctrine of observing ""the very uniformity *743in respect to maritime matters which the Constitution was designed to establish.” Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen, supra, at 217. The looser a legal doctrine, like that of the duty to observe “the uniformity of maritime law,” the more incumbent it is upon the judiciary to apply it with well-defined concreteness. It can fairly be said that the Jensen decision has not been treated as a favored doctrine. Quite the contrary. It has been steadily narrowed in application, as is strikingly illustrated by such a tour de force as our decision in Davis v. Department of Labor, 317 U. S. 249.
The Court today, relying as it does on Jensen, reinvigorates that “ill-starred decision.” Davis v. Department of Labor, supra, at 259 (concurring opinion). The notion that if such a limited and essentially local transaction as the contract here in issue were allowed to be governed by a local statute of frauds it would “disturb the uniformity of maritime law” is, I respectfully submit, too abstract and doctrinaire a view of the true demands of maritime law.

Mr. Justice Harlan,
dissenting.
It is with reluctance that I have reached the conclusion that this Alaska tax offends the Commerce Clause of the Federal Constitution. (Art. I, § 8, cl. 3.)
The Court of Appeals concluded that the taxable event under this statute is the process of freezing fish aboard ship. 277 F. 2d 120. This conclusion was based on the words of the statute (quoted at pp. 199-200 of the Court’s opinion), the fact that obtaining fish for local sale or consumption is untaxéd, and the fact that the present tax “applies whether or not the fish are caught by gill-netters owned by or under contract to appellants.” Id., 125-126. Accepting, as I do, this construction of the statute, I agree with the Court of Appeals that a privilege tax directed solely at shipboard freezing, preparatory to interstate shipment, exceeds the limitations the Commerce *206Clause imposes upon the States, for in its requirement of a license such a tax asserts a power to deny what is a necessary local incident of the right to make interstate purchases. See York Manufacturing Co. v. Colley, 247 U. S. 21.*
As I understand the Court’s opinion, it seeks to meet this objection by denying that the Alaskan tax is imposed on the privilege of freezing fish aboard ships. It says that the tax is rather upon the local taking or purchase of fish by or for freezer boats. But even on this view of the incidence of the tax, I could not agree that the present tax on obtaining fish by or for interstate freezer boats would be constitutional in the given circumstances, for I do not think that Alaska can place a higher tax on the obtaining and freezing of fish for interstate markets than it places on the obtaining and freezing of fish for local markets. See Pennsylvania v. West Virginia, 262 U. S. 653, 596, 597. As shown in the Court’s opinion, under the Alaska scheme of taxation freezer boats, which operate solely in interstate commerce, must pay a tax for taking and freezing Alaskan fish for later, canning in Washington which is four times that imposed on a local freezer whose product is sold to consumers in Alaska. A shore-based freezer who sells his frozen product to Alaskan canners pays no tax at all.
For these reasons I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.

 I also regard the tax as invalid because it in effect charges a toll for the interstate transportation of Alaska’s natural resources. See Brown, The Open Economy: Justice Frankfurter and the Position of the Judiciary, 67 Yale L. J. 219, 232-233.

Although I join in the specific overruling of Commissioner v. Wilcox, 327 U. S. 404 (1946), in The Chief Justice’s opinion, I would affirm this conviction on either of two grounds. I believe that the Court not only devitalized Wilcox, by limiting it to its facts in Rutkin v. United States, 343 U.

It is clear that the court did not intend to charge Petitioner because Congress did not want him to become a prisoner by refusing to pay his taxes. If the court were to believe that the petition was guilty of willful evasion, then the jury would have to consider several factors: 1) whether the petitioner deliberately refused to pay and return the tax; 2) whether the government had given up its right to levy a penalty; and 3) whether the legislature had intended to impose a criminal penalty upon certain persons or classes who committed such acts.",1961-05-15,2.0
6444,9422210,106235,035concurrenceinpart,"In this paper, Justice Douglas dissents from the majority opinion that embezzling money does not count as taxable income. The Court disagrees with the Chief Justice in its opinion that an ""embozzler"" cannot receive a tax due at the time when his unlawful taking occurs. It is clear that the court believes that there are no formalities necessary for the embezzar to assert a claim against the debtor. However, the Supreme Court has consistently held that such formalities will protect the innocent victim. Finally, the case of petitioner who embessed more than $73,000 from the union during the period between 1951 and 1954 is presented. The Union brought civil action against petitioner because he failed to report the gain on his return in the year after the release. The Federalist Papers furthermore argue that black market activity may not be considered lawful because it gives rise to no legal enforceable right to restitution. Thus, even graft or black market activities do not fall under the category of illegal activity. A person can never become ""lawful,"" but still retains its character. For example, black marketers often give up their rights to pay back their loans. If they were legally obligated to repay them, they would have been able to recover their funds without any penalty. Therefore, criminal evades prosecutions could not alter the substantive taxes rules which alone constitute determinative of Liencian liability. Furthermore, although some kinds of illegal activities might not be exemptted from taxation, these types of activities generally provide no legally liable right of repayment. This distinction also applies to other forms of illegal behavior. Black market purchases, gambling, etc. are all examples of illicit activities that violate the Constitution's provisions for taxation. Even if Congress did not explicitly define what kind of activity a business was supposed to be taxing, however, the laws clearly state that a government must comply with its own definition of gross revenue. So, just as we saw earlier in this chapter, whereby a bankrupt had to file a form of bankruptcy before being allowed to make payment, now that Congress has made it clear that creditors should be paid first, federal tax claims are subject to priority over general liens.",1961-05-15,2.0

While I join the opinion of the Court, I add a few words. In an early income tax case, Mr. Justice Holmes said “Men must turn square corners when they deal with the Government.” Rock Island, A. & L. R. Co. v. United States, 254 U. S. 141, 143. The revenue laws have become so complicated and intricate that I think the Government in moving against the citizen should also turn square corners. The Act, 1939 I, R. C. § 22 (k), makes taxable to the husband that part of alimony payments “which the terms of the decree or written instrument fix, in terms of an amount of money or a portion of the payment, as a sum” payable for support of minor children.
I agree with the Court that this agreement did not “fix” any such amount. To be sure, an amount payable in *307support of minor children may be inferred from the proviso that one-sixth of the payment shall no longer be due, if the children marry, become emancipated, or die. But Congress in enacting this law realized that some portion of alimony taxable to the wife might be used for support of the children, as the opinion of the Court makes clear.
The present agreement makes no specific designation of the portion that is intended for the support of the children. It is not enough to say that the sum can be computed. Congress drew a clear line when it used the word “fix.” Resort to litigation, rather than to Congress, for a change in the law is too often the temptation of government which has a longer purse and more endurance than any taxpayer.

Of course I agree with the Court’s opinion. But this is, unfortunately, not an isolated case that happened in Evansville, Indiana, nor an atypical miscarriage of justice due to anticipatory trial by newspapers instead of trial in court before a jury.
More than one student of society has expressed the view that not the least significant test of the quality of a civilization is its treatment of those charged with crime, particularly with offenses which arouse the passions of a community. One of the rightful boasts of Western civilization is that the State has the burden of establishing guilt solely on the basis of evidence produced in court and under circumstances assuring an accused all the safeguards of a fair procedure. These rudimentary conditions for determining guilt are inevitably wanting if the jury which is to sit in judgment on a fellow human being comes to its task with its mind ineradicably poisoned against him. How can fallible men and women reach a disinterested verdict based exclusively on what they heard in court when, before they entered the jury box, their *730minds were saturated by press and radio for months preceding by matter designed to establish the guilt of the accused. A conviction so secured obviously constitutes a denial of due process of law in its most rudimentary conception.
Not a Term passes without this Court being importuned to review convictions, had in States throughout the country, in which substantial claims áre made that a jury trial has been distorted because of inflammatory newspaper accounts — -too often, as in this case, with the prosecutor’s collaboration — exerting pressures upon potential jurors before trial and even during the course of trial, thereby making it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to secure a jury capable of taking in, free of prepossessions, evidence submitted in open court. Indeed such extraneous influences, in violation of the decencies guaranteed by our Constitution, are sometimes so powerful that an accused is forced, as a practical matter, to forego trial by jury. See Maryland v. Baltimore Radio Show, 338 U. S. 912, 915. For one reason or another this Court does not undertake to review all such envenomed state prosecutions. But, again and again, such disregard of fundamental fairness is so flagrant that the Court is compelled, as it was only a week ago, to reverse a conviction in which prejudicial newspaper intrusion has poisoned the outcome. Janko v. United States, ante, p. 716; see, e. g., Marshall v. United States, 360 U. S. 310. See also Stroble v. California, 343 U. S. 181, 198 (dissenting opinion); Shepherd v. Florida, 341 U. S. 50 (concurring opinion). This Court has not yet decided that the fair administration of criminal justice must be subordinated to another safeguard of our constitutional system- — freedom of th¿ press, properly conceived. The Court has not yet decided that, while convictions must be reversed and miscarriages of justice result because the minds of jurors or potential jurors were poisoned, the poisoner is constitutionally protected in plying his trade.

6474,9422235,106261,020lead,"The District Court dismisses a complaint by the railroad company, Northern Lines; it finds that no through routes exist for the movement between the two railroads and that the short haul protection provided by the Act does not apply because the Northern lines are under common management. The court also finds that the refusal to grant joint rates did not cause any prejudice between ships and localities. It is further found that the system was not needed in order to ""provide adequate and more economic transportation."" The district court concludes that substantial evidence supports the judgment of the commission. However, there is only one issue: whether the protection granted by the Constitution extends to three railroads owned by a third. The Northern Railroads compete with each other but have equal shares of the stock of the Southern Lines. The traffic policy of the latter is directed and controlled closely by the traffic department of the Northern line. Transcontinentals traffic matters are left to representatives of the North Lines except local traffic problems. In addition, neither of the northern lines can control the S.P.&S. system as effectively as they do if it were part of its own lines. The argument against this is that both railroads may operate or control different lines within the definition of Short Haul protection from  15(4). The Congress had intended to broaden the definition so that carriers could be held directly responsible for their business. Thus, the term ""control"" refers to those who hold an interest in controlling the operation of a railroad. This definition has been used in many cases since the Transportation Act came into effect. For example, the Black Shear case states that long haul railroads cannot be subjected to higher rates than ratemaking purposes because they are expected to provide economies of operation. Therefore, although not a section 15 4) case, the decision is significant because the courts find that both railways are under ""common management and control.""",1961-06-05,1.0
6475,9422236,106261,040dissent,"Douglas argues that the railroads, the Great Northern Pacific, the Northern Pac, and the Southern Pacific, all pass through Spokane on their way to the West coast. The S-P. &S. is owned by both the Great North and the northern Pacific, but it is disadvantageous in terms of the rate structure because it has to quote combination rates for each route. The advantage that the S.p. '& S. provides to the great northern and northern Pacific is that it can be used as a transportation system between coast and inside points which are more cheaply than over the other lines of theGreat Northern or Northernpac. That is monopolistic advantages; it is controlled over traffic which cannot be exploited so far as this line is concerned. Since 1910 Congress has granted Congress the right not to short-haule, that is, no to have to bear over its lines business originating on or destinedto another line whenthe entire carriage could also have taken place upon its ownline. This means that the Milwaukee does not have to carry out its business on another line since the whole length of the railroad would fit into the definition of ""common management"" under 15 4) of the Transportation Act. It was only later that Congress extended the meaning of control to include joint owners who had two or more railways.

He rejects the charges of perjury brought against the party by the Court. He believes that Congress has declared that the communist party is an instrument of a conspiration to overthrift the government of the United states and that its activities are secretly prescribed for them by foreign leaders. The Constitution does not allow any individual to be required to sign or file a public statement before making a speech; however, there are certain circumstances where this may be necessary. For example, lobbyists receive fees from political parties because they are unpopular. If these groups engage in illegal activities, such as picketing, then the more unpopular they are, the greater their likelihood of harassing members. In addition, the Fifth amendment allows Congress to require disclosure of information about business and commercial matters. This means that no one can be forced to sign the declaration without being asked to do so. It also means that anyone who signs the declaration will have to disclose his identity within the twelve-month period. However, if Congress were to remove the compulsory disclosure on the other side of the constitution, the problems would disappear. Finally, the question of whether the Fifth Amendment protects individuals who sign the register must be answered. If Congress had allowed embezzleders to sign without immunity, then embelezzlers would not be obliged to sign under the Fifth Act. Instead, the only problem with signing the declaration is that it will reveal all knowledge of and relationships with the Communist Club.

It has not been the custom of the Court, in deciding the cases which come before it, to write lengthy and abstract dissertations upon questions which are neither pre*636sented by the record nor necessary to a proper disposition of the issues raised. The opinion which announces the judgment of the Court in the instant case has departed from this custom and is in the nature of an advisory opinion, for it attempts to resolve with finality many difficult problems which are at best only tangentially involved here. The opinion was unquestionably written with the intention of clarifying these problems and of establishing a set of principles which could be easily applied in any coerced-confession situation. However, it is doubtful that such will be the result, for while three members of the Court agree to the general principles enunciated by the opinion, they construe those principles as requiring a result in this case exactly the opposite from that reached by the author of the opinion. This being true, it cannot be assumed that the lower courts and law enforcement agencies will receive better guidance from the treatise for which this case seems to have provided a vehicle. On an abstract level, I find myself in agreement with some portions of the opinion and in disagreement with other portions. However, I would prefer not to write on many of the difficult questions which the opinion discusses until the facts of a particular case make such writing necessary. In my view, the reasons which have compelled the Court to develop the law on- a case-by-case approach, to declare legal principles only in the context of specific factual situations, and to avoid expounding more than is necessary for the decision of a given case are persuasive. See Alabama State Federation of Labor v. McAdory, 325 U. S. 450, 461-462, and cases cited; Poe v. Ullman, ante, p. 497.

I agree to what my Brother Frankfurter has written in delineation of the general principles governing police interrogation of those suspected of, or under investigation in connection with, the commission of crime, and as to the factors which should guide federal judicial review of state action in this field. I think, however, that upon this record, which contains few of the hallmarks usually found in “coerced confession” cases, such considerations find their proper reflection in affirmance of this judgment.
With due regard to the medical and other evidence as to petitioner’s history and subnormal mentality, I am unable to consider that it was constitutionally impermissible for the State to conclude that petitioner’s “Wednesday” confessions were the product of a deliberate choice on his part to try to ameliorate his fate by making a clean breast of things, and not the consequence of improper police activity. To me, petitioner’s supplemental confession on the following Saturday night, which as depicted by the record bears all the indicia of spontaneity, is especially persuasive against this Court’s contrary view.
I should also add that I find no constitutional infirmity in the standards used by the Connecticut courts in evaluating the voluntariness of petitioner’s confessions. Cf. Rogers v. Richmond, 365 U. S. 534.

The warrant used to search appellants’ premises made no attempt specifically to describe the “things to be seized,” as the Fourth Amendment requires. As the historical summary in the Court’s opinion demonstrates, a major purpose of adopting that Amendment was to bar the Federal Government from using precisely this kind of general warrant to support “unreasonable searches and seizures” of the “papers” and “effects” of persons having possession of them. See especially Entick v. Carrington, 19 Howell’s State Trials 1029, at 1073-1076; Boyd v. United States, 116 U. S. 616, 624-630; Frank v. Maryland, 359 U. S. 360, 374 (dissenting opinion). It is my view that the Fourteenth Amendment makes the Fourth Amendment applicable to the States to the full extent of its terms, just as it applies to the Federal Government. See Adamson v. California, 332 U. S. 46, 68 *739(dissenting opinion). Only last Term we said that in Wolf v. Colorado, 338 U. S. 25, “it was unequivocally determined by a unanimous Court that the Federal Constitution, by virtue of the Fourteenth Amendment, prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures by state officers.” Elkins v. United States, 364 U. S. 206, 213. And in Mapp v. Ohio, ante, p. 643, it is said that “[s]ince the Fourth Amendment’s right of privacy has been declared enforceable against the States through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth, it is enforceable against them by the same sanction of exclusion as is used against the Federal Government.” Since the State has used a general warrant in this case in violation of the prohibitions of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments, I concur in reversal of the judgment.

After considering archaeological evidence, the Court concludes that each state's share of river waters must be divided according to the meaning and scope of Congress's ""Boulder Canyon Project Act"" which passed on June 19, 1921. This compact divides the basin into three parts: the upper Basin, the lower Basin; and the unapportiond waters subject to reapapportment after 1963. Both states oppose the compact because it does not provide for exclusive uses of her own tribes, especially the Gila--the only major state tributarian. However, both states support the compact by arguing that this compact is the same as the project act itself.

Instead, the bill allows the Secretary to use his discretion to grant or deny water to anyone who receives water under the compact.

He contends that it is reasonable to assume that the union's actions are subject to state jurisdiction because of the principles set forth in Gonzales and Garmon. The case concerns a member who was employed by a local plumber's union when he arrived in Texas looking for work on a construction project. When the business agent refused to refer him to a job, the union employee told him that he would not be going to work with Farwell; instead, the farwell worker shoveled his card down his throat and said: ""You are not about to sent that olddown there, you have came in here wrong."" This act violates the rights of the union members as they relate to their employment. The suit seeks damages from the union and its business agent. The court dismisses the suit but grants preemptive relief under the provisions of Section 8 of the national labor law. The Supreme Court disagrees with the district court's interpretation of the Texas Constitution. It is necessary to determine whether federal law prevents state courts from engaging in labor disputes. The first question in this case is whether the conduct complained of is subject to federal jurisdiction. The jury finds that the Dallas Union business agent did not refer the petitioner to any particular job. The actual loss of earnings resulted from the refusal. Although the trial court had found that the employer failed to comply with the union rules, the court has held that such conduct does not necessarily violate federal law. Furthermore, the fact that the company refuses to refer the complainant to another job may well have caused the rejection. If the facts were true, then the Board could conclude that the action was not an unwelcome activity within the definition of protected activity. Even if the matter comes into the Board's jurisdiction, however, the State courts will still be able to adjudicate the matter.",1963-06-03,2.0

In my opinion none of the considerations underlying the doctrine of federal judicial abstention (see Harrison v. N. A. A. C. P., 360 U. S. 167, 176-177) call for its application here. There is no reasonable likelihood that a prior state construction of this License Code would either change the complexion of the constitutional issue or avoid the necessity of its eventual adjudication by this Court.
Even were this local enactment to be construed by the state courts to require a license of the appellant as a precondition of engaging in the distribution of natural gas within the City of Mobile, that of itself would not ordain the answer to the constitutional question. See Southern Natural Gas Corp. v. Alabama, 301 U. S. 148; East Ohio Gas Co. v. Tax Comm’n, 283 U. S. 465; see also Illinois Natural Gas Co. v. Central Illinois Pub. Serv. Co., 314 U. S. 498, 506. Cf.

Were I able to find, as Judge Aldrich did, that the District Court’s judgment of acquittal was based solely on the Assistant United States Attorney’s alleged misconduct, I would think that a retrial of the petitioners would not be prevented by the Double Jeopardy Clause of the *144Fifth Amendment. Even assuming that a trial court may have power, in extreme circumstances, to direct a judgment of acquittal, instead of declaring a mistrial, because of a prosecutor’s misconduct — a proposition which I seriously doubt — I do not think that such power existed in the circumstances of this case.

If we were able to read the several opinions in the Michigan Supreme Court the way our Brother Harlan does, we would find much to persuade us that this case should not be remanded. But the state court opinions are not that clear to us. A careful reading of the opinions leaves us with the fixed impression that all but three members of the Michigan court were convinced that, whatever the underlying merits of the appellant's Equal Protection claim, it was, in the words of one of the justices, “not enforcible in the courts.” 360 Mich. 1, 112, 104 N.

The present order of course reflects no views on the merits of the appellant’s Equal Protection claim.

No one suggests that Congress was aware that 28 U. S. C. § 1406 (a) might be so used when it enacted that statute. The “interest of justice” of which the statute speaks and which the Court's opinion emphasizes in support of its construction of § 1406 (a) is assuredly not a one-way street. And it is incongruous to consider, as the Court’s holding would seem to imply, that in the “interest of justice” Congress sought in § 1406 (a) to deal with the transfer of cases where both venue and jurisdiction are lacking in the district where the action is commenced, while neglecting to provide any comparable alleviative measures for the plaintiff who selects a district where venue is proper but where personal jurisdiction cannot be obtained.*
In these circumstances I think the matter is better left for further action by Congress, preferably after the Judicial Conference of the United States has expressed its views on the subject. Cf. Miner v. Atlass, 363 U. S. 641, 650-652. Meanwhile, substantially for the reasons elaborated in the opinion of Judge Moore, 288 F. 2d 579, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.

In an ordinary diversity suit, for example, a plaintiff may bring suit in the judicial district where he resides. 28 U. S. C. § 1391 (a). But if he is unable to get personal service on the defendant in the territory defined by Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 4 (f), his suit will be dismissed. See Robertson v. Railroad Labor Board, 268 U. S. 619; cf. Mississippi Publishing Corp. v. Murphree, 326 U. S. 438, 442-443. Since this would not be “a case laying venue in the wrong division or district/’ § 1406 (a) would be inapplicable.

concurring.
I am disposed to accept the view, strongly pressed at the bar, that this complaint seeks an accounting for alleged trademark infringement, rather than contract damages. Even though this leaves the complaint as formally asking only for equitable relief,* this does not end the inquiry. The fact that an “accounting” is sought is not of itself dispositive of the jury trial issue. To render this aspect of the complaint truly “equitable” it must appear that the substantive claim is one cognizable only in equity or that the “accounts between the parties” are of such a “complicated nature” that they can be satisfactorily unraveled only by a court of equity. Kirby v. Lake Shore & Michigan Southern R. Co., 120 U. S. 130, 134. See 5 Moore, Federal Practice (1951), 198-202. It is manifest from the face of the complaint that the “accounting” sought in this instance is not of either variety. A jury, under proper instructions from the court, could readily calculate the damages flowing from this alleged *481trademark infringement, just as courts of law often do in copyright and patent cases. Cf., e. g., Hartell v. Tilghman, 99 U. S. 547, 555; Arnstein v. Porter, 154 F. 2d 464; Bruckman v. Hollzer, 152 F. 2d 730.
Consequently what is involved in this case is nothing more than a joinder in one complaint of prayers for both legal and equitable relief. In such circumstances, under principles long since established, Scott v. Neely, 140 U. S. 106, 110, the petitioner cannot be deprived of his constitutional right to a jury trial on the “legal” claim contained in the complaint.
On this basis I concur in the judgment of the Court.

Except as to the damage claim there is no dispute but that the complaint seeks only equitable relief.

The case is dismissed on October 21, 1957 after hearing. On September 30, 1957, El-Pao and Pacific North file a motion for dismissal or to stay the suit pending final decision of the proceedings. On October 20, 1958, the court continues the trial until the final judgment in the administration proceedings. After the transaction is consummated, Petitioner appeals to the Court's opinion regarding whether there are violations of the Antitrust Laws. The Court remands the case back to the original issue of whether the federal power commission should proceed to approve a proposed acquisition when there is still a potential antitrust suit against the company.",1962-04-30,2.0
6648,9422394,106386,040dissent,"In this case, Harlan argues that the Federal Power commission must not pass on an approval of a proposed Merger when there is still pending an antitrust lawsuit. The Court considers three practical reasons for refusing to grant relief: 1) If the asset acquisition were approved; 2) If the stock purchase afterwards held to be unlawful; and 3) The approval of the Merger is bound to carry motion into the Antitrust suit. These reasons are inappropriate because they would ""raise complicated"" problems on tax issues and otherwise.""

He is accused of income tax fraud and conspiracy to defraud the Teamsters union. The court dismisses his motion for a new trial and five other motions on bias and prejudice from the public. On May 3, petitioner is charged with income taxes evasion; on April 26, the county prosecuting attorney announces that he will be called to investigate potential misuse of Teamster Union funds by International President Dave Beck. Five days after the hearing, Beck is arrested for additional income tax offenses. In November 12, Beck is convicted of several other crimes.

6656,9422401,106391,040dissent,"In this paper, Justice Black dissents from the Court's decision that the failure by the Washington courts not to follow their state law by insuring Beck's right to an independent grand jury was ""a denial"" to Beck of the equal rights guaranteed by the Constitution. The legislature has passed a statute guaranteeing impartial grand jures for all criminal cases. It also states that it is the duty of the judge to make inquiries necessary to protect against prejudiced and biased grand jurers. Although the court does not change the law, however, its interpretation remains the same. Because of the excessive public publicity surrounding Beck as a member of the International Brothershood of Teamsters and as formerly president of the western conference of Teamsters, the Seattle area becomes known as being one of the most aggressive places in the country for scandalous and violent charges against Beck on May 3, May 9, 15, 15 and 16, among other days. On May 20, the grand jury were impanelered. After such restrained effort towards affording Beck protection from a corrupt and prejudiced Grand jury, it would have been expected that the Presiding Judge would have given detailed instructions to ensure that no prejudiced persons were left on the jury. But instead, the judge made no attempt to dispel prejudice or bias; instead, he asked many questions about Beck' involvement in the union and whether he ever had any connection to the teamsters or any associated union. Finally, despite the fact that there are so many potential prejudices between the two groups, the court cannot find any reason why the judge did not take steps to prevent bias or prejudice from entering the courtroom. For another reason, Beck claims that his constitutional rights were not properly presented before the Washington supreme court. He asserts that since the Supreme Court refused to consider constitution attacks upon laws not made in trial court, the case must be presented to the highest court.",1962-06-25,1.0
6657,9422402,106391,040dissent,"In this paper, Douglas argues that the Washington state does not need a grand juror in order to convict people on charges of crimes. It occasionally uses one, and it is used because it will ensure that the accused is impartial. He also discusses the importance of having a due process clause in the Constitution. The Supreme Court affirmed a judgment of conviction by an equal divided vote. However, there are other examples of unfairness in criminal proceedings where the court has no right to question the evidence. For example, when a person is arrested or detained for a confession, the police use the ""grand jury,"" which is composed of political enemies. If we were to find out that the case was being investigated by a political enemy, we would have to hold that the required due process is lacking.",1962-06-25,1.0

The question concerned whether union funds and influence were used to suppress a criminal investigation in Lake County that had been conducted by a county prosecutor. Although petitioner does not answer these questions, the Committee believes that he may have a due process claim under the Fifth Amendment because he has never claimed the privilege prior to the committee. However, it is decided that the due process claims are not open to petitioner now.",1962-06-25,1.0
6660,9422404,106393,030concurrence,"In this brief, Hamilton argues that petitioner's Fifth Amendment privilege does not apply to federal criminal proceedings. The case is similar to the one before him in which the Committee sought factual material about the improper conduct of union officials and failed to find any legislative purpose. However, it did not matter whether the evidence presented at the trial was essential or not. Thus, the questioning of Petitioner did not cross paths with the Congress's legitimate task of correcting ""just such evils"" as those concerning his union.",1962-06-25,1.0
6661,9422405,106393,040dissent,"In this case, Harlan argues that Congress cannot use its power to conduct an investigation of union activity and funds because it violates the due process clause of the Fifth Constitution. He contends that the petitioner's dilemma had four horns: 1) he could be sent to court for refusing his choice of imposition of penalty; 2) he would have been imprisoned in prison for failing to answer certain questions; and 3) he might also be sentenced to jail for refusaling to choose whether or not to respond to these questions. Harlan defends the constitutionality of Congress's ability to conduct investigations by arguing that ""the duty of courts"" to protect individual liberties is particularly important when Congress has granted the federal courts the power to do so. This principle, which Harlan refers to as the ""least possible power adequate,"" states that Congress must use its least possible power ""to the end proposed."" The Court disagrees with Harlan on this point, but Harlan points out that there are other circumstances in which Congress may be able to use its most powerful power. For example, while the House passed a settlement concerning Jay Cook's estate, the House did not have the authority to grant any relief from the debtors. It was enough that the House refused to allow Kilburn to testify against him. However, since the transaction into which Congress asked was a civil case, the court found that the matter was one ""judicial in character, and can only be properly made by a court-of- justice."" Thus, even though the House tried to ask about the specific details of the dispute between Jay Cook1s creditors, they were still pending before the court. Therefore, the question at hand here is whether Congress has allowed the government to proceed in such a way as to interfere with the rights of individuals protected by the bill of rights.",1962-06-25,1.0

He contends that the power of Congress to punish witnesses for refusing to testify violates due process because it is impossible for he to plead his case directly or indirectly.

  Per Curiam.,
 

  Petitioner was convicted in an Ohio state court of assault with intent to kill and of cutting with intent to kill, wound or maim the same person. He immediately sought a writ of habeas corpus which was denied on the ground that appeal was the proper remedy. He then attempted to appeal, but this was denied as out of time and the Supreme Court of Ohio affirmed this denial. He unsuccessfully sought habeas corpus twice more, the latest petition being to the Supreme Court of Ohio and alleging, among other matters, a denial of counsel at his trial and a deprivation of rights guaranteed by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Supreme Court of Ohio denied the petition, holding that habeas corpus was not a substitute for appeal and was not available to remedy the defects alleged by petitioner. Petitioner now seeks our writ of certiorari to review that ruling.

dissenting.
Certiorari was granted in this case because it was thought that the legal principles underlying one aspect of the decision below were in conflict with those applied by the Second Circuit in Grillea v. United States, 232 F. 2d 919.
The Court, however, does not resolve that conflict, nor does it decide any other question of law not already established by its past decisions. Instead, the judgment below is reversed meiely because this Court disagrees with the Court of Appeals’ factual estimate of the case.
*704Had the issue which the Court decides been the only-question tendered by the petition for certiorari, the case could not well have been regarded as one for review by this Court. See Rogers v. Missouri Pacific R. Co., 352 U. S. 500, 524, 559 (dissenting opinions). To reverse it now on what is essentially only an evidentiary ground is, in my view, an improvident use of the certiorari power: the Court has done no more than “to substitute its views” for those of the Court of Appeals on purely factual issues, reached upon a fair assessment of the trial record. 352 U. S., at 562-563. Respecting the legal issues which this Court does not decide, I think that the Court of Appeals was plainly correct in deciding them as it did.
